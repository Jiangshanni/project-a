While prices of some of the island<U+2019>s bonds traded lower, there was nothing close to the kind of mass sell-off that might indicate a panic, Michael Corkery reports in DealBook.Investors have been anticipating the downgrade of Puerto Rico<U+2019>s debt for months, and many firms, like BlackRock, have reduced their Puerto Rico exposure to soften the blow of just such an event. Other investors including hedge funds and private equity firms see an opportunity in the steep drop in prices of the bonds, though the prices have not dropped far enough to justify a buying spree.In any case, most investors continue to have confidence in the island<U+2019>s ability to pay back its debts because of a longstanding bargain: Investors have lent Puerto Rico billions of dollars in the past, and, as a result, the island<U+2019>s bonds have generated extremely high returns. And though the bargain has become precarious, with the downgrade causing a cash squeeze for the commonwealth, some large investors still say they have faith that the island<U+2019>s government won<U+2019>t let them down. STILL NO VERDICT IN SAC INSIDER TRADING TRIAL <U+00A0>|<U+00A0> After its second day of deliberating, the jury in the insider trading trial of Mathew Martoma, a former portfolio manager at SAC Capital Advisors, still has not reached a verdict. The day<U+2019>s most notable development was that the jury of seven women and five men requested the transcript of testimony supporting the defense<U+2019>s claim that Mr. Martoma was not guilty. But even this move should be taken lightly, as lawyers cautioned that predicting how a jury will vote based on evidence requests is difficult and can lead to erroneous conclusions, Alexandra Stevenson and Rachel Abrams write in DealBook. The jury will continue deliberating on Thursday morning.CURRENCY TRADING IN FLUX <U+00A0>|<U+00A0> As the banking industry continues to grapple with a series of investigations of potential manipulation of the currency markets, foreign exchange desks are looking a bit thin. More than a dozen currency traders at some of the world<U+2019>s largest banks, including Barclays, UBS and JPMorgan Chase, have been placed on leave over questions about whether they colluded to manipulate the $5-trillion-a-day currency market. Deutsche Bank fired the head of its emerging markets foreign exchange trading desk in New York and two traders just this week.And some executives at prominent financial institutions like Citigroup and Goldman Sachs have simply had enough. Anil Prasad, the global head of Citigroup<U+2019>s foreign exchange and local markets operations, is leaving the bank to <U+201C>pursue other interests<U+201D> while Steven Cho, the global head of Goldman<U+2019>s Group of 10 nations spot and forward trading group, is retiring.The moves come as many of the world<U+2019>s largest banks are facing inquiries from regulators in Britain, the United States and other parts of the world regarding potential manipulation of foreign exchange rates. On that note, New York State<U+2019>s financial regulator, Benjamin M. Lawsky, recently began an investigation into whether more than a dozen banks manipulated the price of foreign currencies, bringing the global inquiry to our doorsteps.A.I.G. SEEKS TO DELAY BANK OF AMERICA MORTGAGE SETTLEMENT <U+00A0>|<U+00A0> The American International Group seems determined to upend the $8.5 billion settlement between Bank of America and a group of 22 mortgage securities investors, most of which was approved last Friday. On Tuesday, A.I.G.<U+2019>s lawyers filed papers in New York State Supreme Court seeking to delay final approval of the deal.At the center of the lawsuit are more than 500 mortgage-backed securities involving troubled loans issued by Countrywide Financial. The investors, who held these bonds, agreed to settle their claims with Bank of America, which acquired Countrywide in 2008. But A.I.G., another investor in the bonds, refused to sign the settlement, arguing that the sum represented only a fraction of the overall losses and that the trustee for the bonds, Bank of New York Mellon, shirked its responsibility in pushing for more money in the settlement.

3,https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/07/14/morning-agenda-citigroup-in-7-billion-settlement/,7/14/14,"Citigroup and the Justice Department have agreed to a $7 billion deal that will settle a federal investigation into the mortgage securities the bank sold in the run-up to the financial crisis, Michael Corkery writes in DealBook. The deal, announced on Monday morning, includes a $4 billion cash penalty to the Justice Department <U+2012> the largest payment of its kind <U+2012> as well as $2.5 billion in so-called soft dollars earmarked for aiding struggling consumers and $500 million to state attorneys general and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The bank, which is scheduled to announce second-quarter earnings at 8 a.m., said the settlement would result in a pretax charge of $3.8 billion before taxes in the period.The deal caps months of contentious talks that began with a $363 million offer by Citigroup followed by a $12 billion demand from the Justice Department, a gap that stemmed from the radically divergent methods used to calculate the cost of the settlement, DealBook<U+2019>s Ben Protess, Jessica Silver-Greenberg and Michael Corkery write. Citigroup linked its initial offer to the bank<U+2019>s relatively small share of the market for mortgage securities. But the Justice Department rejected that argument, emphasizing instead what it saw as Citigroup<U+2019>s level of culpability based on incriminating emails and other evidence it had uncovered.The Justice Department was prepared in June to announce a lawsuit against Citigroup as negotiations with the bank stalled. But the capture of a suspect in the deadly attack in Benghazi, Libya, led federal prosecutors to postpone the announcement, opening the door to further negotiations. The main breakthrough toward a settlement took a simple feat of accounting: The bank agreed to shift a portion of the settlement from state attorneys general to the Justice Department, preventing Citigroup from claiming a tax deduction on the settlement.ABBVIE IMPROVES BID FOR SHIRE  |  The Irish drug maker Shire said on Monday that its board was prepared to recommend an improved takeover bid of 53.20 pounds a share, the equivalent of about $53 billion, that it received over the weekend from AbbVie, Chad Bray writes in DealBook. The latest offer is the fifth revised bid by AbbVie, which is based in Chicago.The deal, if completed, would allow AbbVie to reincorporate in Britain and save millions of dollars in taxes, a process known as an inversion. Shire has its headquarters in Ireland and is listed in London. AbbVie is hoping to reach a deal for Shire before July 18, when it will have to make a firm offer or walk away for up to six months under British takeover rules.SWEET DEAL  |  The Swiss chocolate maker Chocoladefabriken Lindt & Spr<U+00FC>ngli said on Monday that it had reached an agreement to acquire Russell Stover Candies, the American maker of boxed chocolates, Chad Bray writes in DealBook.

Happy Bastille Day. DEBT SETTLEMENT COMPANIES UNDER FIRE  |  The debt settlement industry, already accused of questionable tactics related to mortgages, has found a gold mine of new customers: those with student debt, Rachel Abrams and Jessica Silver-Greenberg write in DealBook. Federal and state regulators are now finding new instances of abuse as these debt settlement companies shift from mortgage and credit card debt to student loans.On Monday, Illinois is expected to become the first state to bring legal action against debt settlement companies in connection with their student loan practices, contending in two separate lawsuits that Broadsword Student Advantage and First American Tax Defense duped vulnerable borrowers into paying for help that never arrived. The companies often misled customers about fees, according to the suits, and in some instances feigned affiliation with federal relief programs. In some cases, the Illinois attorney general contends, the companies charged customers for debt assistance that they could have received free from the Education Department.  |  Contact: @melbournecoal | E-mailSign up for the DealBook Newsletter, delivered every morning and afternoon.<U+00A0>Merger of Tobacco Rivals Faces a Fight  |  A deal between Reynolds American and Lorillard would unite the makers of the Camel and Newport brands and reshape the industry by creating a more formidable rival to the Altria Group, home of Marlboro.

4,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/04/jindalcare-and-the-g-o-p-dilemma/,4/4/14,"On Monday, I wrote that the apparent stabilization of Obamacare sharpens the political and policy challenge facing the law<U+2019>s critics. Instead of the sort of easy unraveling that some Republicans had convinced themselves was in the offing, I argued (in a point made rather<U+00A0>more forcefully by Ramesh Ponnuru) that<U+00A0>it<U+2019>s now much more likely that the only way the things conservatives dislike about Obamacare will ever change or go away is if conservatives actually unite around reforms or a replacement that sustains some of the current law<U+2019>s coverage expansion (albeit on significantly different terms).My sense is that some Republicans half-agree. That is, they<U+2019>re willing to concede that the party needs an Obamacare replacement that<U+2019>s more serious than some of the G.O.P.<U+2019>s circa-2009 alternatives. But they also think the law will remain so unpopular, and that the number of losers will exceed the number of winners so dramatically, that conservative policymakers will have more room to maneuver, in terms of the initial coverage numbers a replacement might sustain, than my reading of the situation would suggest.The health care reform proposal rolled out by Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal this week offers a<U+00A0>specific example of how this perspective cashes out. Unlike some other recent Republican proposals (most notably, the bill co-sponsored in the Senate earlier this year), which promise tax cuts and savings relative to current policy, Jindal<U+2019>s proposal explicitly starts with the 2008 baseline, and promises not to tax or spend a dollar more. His proposed reform would convert the open-ended deduction for employer-provided insurance into a flat deduction, extend the same deduction to people outside the employer market, and channel $100 billion over ten years to the states to provide for high-risk pools and other measures to help cover people with pre-existing conditions.<U+00A0>What it conspicuously wouldn<U+2019>t do is create the kind of tax credit for catastrophic coverage that you<U+2019>ll often find in right-of-center health care alternatives<U+00A0><U+2014><U+00A0>because that would cost money relative to the 2008 baseline, and/or require further disruptions elsewhere in the system. Which means, in turn, that if you replaced Obamacare with Jindalcare in 2017, you<U+2019>d see a coverage expansion relative to the Bush era, but a large number of the newly-insured would lose coverage without any immediate prospect of regaining it.Jindal was in D.C. yesterday to talk about his plan (full disclosure, I was there), and the Washington Examiner<U+2019>s Philip Klein has a good write-up of how he responded to, shall we say, pushback on this point:Jindal was pressed on why he chose to offer a tax deduction for individuals to purchase insurance rather than a refundable tax credit. Supporters of the tax credit approach argue that it would benefit more people, because lower-income Americans don<U+2019>t pay enough taxes for the deduction to be valuable enough to make insurance premiums affordable.He said that he decided on the deduction approach because relying on tax credits would be so costly that it would require tax increases <U+2013> and Jindal doesn<U+2019>t want his plan to spend more or tax more than the system that existed prior to Obamacare<U+2019>s passage. He also argued that credits would cause more disruption to the employer-based market and would be more prone to fraud.He said that whatever amounts of money conservatives were willing to allocate to address a problem, Democrats would always be willing to spend more, so conservatives cannot get into a bidding war.Jindal cited previous estimates of similar reform proposals to his own, which he said could reduce family health insurance premiums by $5,000 annually and increase coverage by 9 million people relative to the number of people who were covered prior to Obamacare.<U+201C>I don<U+2019>t think conservative health care reform is about saying we<U+2019>re going to compete with them in terms of how many people we say have an insurance card,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>That<U+2019>s not the ultimate goal.<U+201D>So obviously the governor and I have a substantive disagreement here: Like Jindal, I<U+2019>m deeply skeptical of the <U+201C>give everyone a Medicaid card<U+201D> approach to health care reform, but that skepticism pushes me toward supporting a basic catastrophic protection (and other reforms) instead, rather than toward just accepting, for the foreseeable future, a health insurance marketplace that prices a lot of working class Americans out of affordable coverage of any sort.But for the purposes of this post, I<U+2019>m more interested in the politics of the debate. Politically, I don<U+2019>t think there<U+2019>s any question that Jindal<U+2019>s argument <U+2014> go back to the pre-Obamacare baseline, expand coverage modestly relative to that <U+2014><U+00A0>would play well with at least part of the G.O.P. electorate in a primary campaign. For a case, contra myself and Ponnuru, that it could also play pretty well in the general election and in a subsequent legislative battle, here<U+2019>s Ben Domenech, writing in yesterday<U+2019>s edition of his newsletter The Transom:<U+2026> when President Obama sold his health care law to the American people, he sold it to them primarily on the basis of cost. He did this because the polling was so unanimous: people weren<U+2019>t demanding massive increased regulation of the insurance marketplace to achieve any particular moral goal about coverage levels or anything of the sort <U+2013> the vast majority of Americans just cared that their premiums cost too much. So Obama made the case for his law based not on increasing coverage, but on decreasing costs <U+2013> and along the way, he promised that no one would lose their doctor, their plan, or see worse coverage because of his law. In each case, his case was in line with the polling data on what the American people wanted.But what about making the case for health policy reforms in the post-Obamacare era? For most center-right health policy experts and opinion-makers, the assumption has taken hold that coverage levels must be sustained or even increased under any comparable reform. They believe the argument in favor of universal coverage has been lost, and that any plan which kicks people off of an entitlement program is doomed to fail, politically.This is an assumption held by most people in Washington and the media. But I wonder how accurate it is. Post-Obamacare polling data on this question is lacking, but given the behavior of so many individuals and entities in reaction to Obamacare it<U+2019>s possible that the bulk of Americans still hold the same views they did prior to the law<U+2019>s passage: that they want to retain their current plans, that they dislike disruption in their insurance experience, but that most of all, they want lower costs for themselves, not broader coverage for everybody else.I agree that support for universal coverage has tended to be soft, rising when it seems theoretical and then diminishing when the trade-offs actually present themselves. But my expectation is that with Obamacare in place, the psychology of loss aversion changes this calculus in two ways. First, indirectly <U+2014><U+00A0>because it seems worse to most people to lose a benefit than to have never enjoyed it, voters will feel more morally uncomfortable supporting a candidate who promises to strip other people<U+2019>s coverage than they would have felt voting for a candidate who opposed the expansion originally. And second, directly<U+00A0><U+2014> because over the next few years, even voters who dislike Obamacare and aren<U+2019>t getting subsidies are likely to internalize the idea that they now have an additional backstop in the event of job-loss or illness, and so voting to roll the program back completely and start afresh without that backstop will, again, be more unpopular than never creating it in the first place would have been. (The consistent presence, in most polls, of an anti-Obamacare demographic that prefer changes to outright repeal suggests to me that the idea of maintaining some kind of quasi-universal guarantee has relatively strong appeal.)I<U+2019>d also make a broader point: Yes, the health care law remains unpopular, but it was unpopular in 2012 as well, and the economy was worse, and the Republican nominee still went down to defeat<U+00A0><U+2014> not least, I would submit, because of the perception that he couldn<U+2019>t be trusted to safeguards the interests of the non-rich. So even if people generally care more about cost than coverage, it still seems quite likely that this fatal impression of the party<U+2019>s priorities would be accentuated, rather than diminished, in a 2016 campaign where the Republican nominee would be quite directly promising to drive the uninsured rate up.My expectation could be confounded, I concede, if the next few years are a true disaster of spiking premiums and stagnant newly-insured numbers. And<U+00A0>I would certainly agree with Domenech that the structure of the law is a lot more vulnerable than exuberant liberals seem to think this week.But I also think that in political terms, it<U+2019>s actually slightly crazy for Republicans to bet this way given the other options available to them. The Jindal theory, that the right shouldn<U+2019>t bother competing with liberals on certain policy fronts because they<U+2019>ll always be outbid, is generally problematic (why does his proposal have any coverage expansion, then?) but it<U+2019>s a particularly odd idea to embrace in a case where the liberal program may not, as even its defenders allow, actually end up delivering the scale of coverage expansion that was expected.By which I mean that if the current enrollment trends persist, there is a good chance that some version of a more catastrophic-focused reform could actually enroll somewhat more Americans in some kind of basic coverage than Obamacare, at a substantially lower cost. (A preliminary private score of the Senate Republican bill suggested it could get slightly higher coverage numbers, and that was <U+2014> I believe<U+00A0><U+2014><U+00A0>using the C.B.O. projections for Obamacare, which may turn out to have been too high.) Which in turn would offer Republicans an opportunity to effectively outbid the Democrats on enrollment while significantly<U+00A0>underbidding them on spending. (The Democrats could, of course, counter with single-payer <U+2014> but the G.O.P. should<U+00A0>want<U+00A0>to provoke that debate!) And to pass up that unusual opportunity in favor of a probably-doomed fidelity to a nearly decade-old baseline <U+2026> well, I suppose it would be very much like the Republican Party I<U+2019>ve come to know and love so well."
5,https://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/12/22/student-winners-from-our-2015-review-contest/,12/22/15,"Back in October we challenged teenagers to go out and experience works of culture that were new to them, then write about it for our first Review Contest. Over 1,600 students took us up on the offer, and, since our rules stated that they could choose any genre of creative work reviewed by The Times, below you<U+2019>ll find submissions on everything from <U+201C>South Park<U+201D> to Mozart; an American Airlines on-board meal to a graphic novel about Jeffrey Dahmer; a video game that <U+201C>dismantles the fluid morality of other RPGs<U+201D> to a Valentino ready-to-wear show that <U+201C>interweaves the diverse cultures<U+201D> of Africa and Italy.Congratulations to our nine winners, nine runners-up and 22 honorable mentions, listed in alphabetical order below. Please visit our calendar to see what other contests we<U+2019>re running this year. WinnersRunners-UpHonorable MentionsWinners<U+201C><U+2018>Futurity': Innovative Exploration of the Civil War<U+201D>Toby Berggruen, age 15Imagine a man born in the Civil War who lives to see the first men walk on the moon in 1969. A fictional correspondence between a Union soldier and the first computer scientist. A steam-powered brain that brings world peace. That is the challenge of the play <U+201C>Futurity,<U+201D> a strange alchemy of music, history, fiction and philosophy. The premise may be absurd but the questions are urgent and real, as pressing today as they were in the 1860s.Presented at the intimate Connelly Theater on the Lower East Side, this co-production between the Soho Rep and Ars Nova opens in the thick of the Civil War. <U+201C>Futurity<U+201D> tells the story of Julian Munro, a fictional soldier portrayed by its creator, C<U+00E9>sar Alvarez. Through Munro, we delve into the brutal realities of wartime America, and the prescient imagination of a lone soldier. Finding himself in the midst of a world abound with pain and suffering, Munro begins to imagine a solution to human conflict, a mechanical machine that will bridge the humanities and sciences, accomplishing world peace. In his search, he begins a correspondence with Ada Lovelace, a remarkable mathematician played by the forceful, exuberant Sammy Tunis. The sagacious brilliance of Lovelace seamlessly meshes with the idealist Munro, who exudes hope and creative energy. The two grapple with issues both personal and universal as they embark on a journey into an opaque realm of invention and morality.Mr. Alvarez deserves much praise for his impassioned performance; his display showcases wit, confidence and rich voice. The play<U+2019>s music combines powerful folk song with the edge and nonconformity of a David Byrne song. Its lyrics are themselves masterful <U+2014> aphoristic, poignant and true <U+2014> profuse with existential questions such as, <U+201C>Is morality made of information?<U+201D> Directed by Sarah Benson, all aspects of <U+201C>Futurity<U+201D> mesh together with ease and intensity, combining effortless choreography and rich set design. <U+201C>Futurity<U+201D> asks questions, questions that make us think deeply about who we really are. They are certainly too vast to list, but one question keeps ringing in my mind: How to solve unsolvable problems? Is it possible to solve the unspeakable evil of our world? How? Through a synthesis of the perfection of the mathematical world and the depths of art, as <U+201C>Futurity<U+201D> suggests? As the General touchingly reminds us, <U+201C>I believe that this body is all I have, and that it<U+2019>ll take more than a war to make it safe.<U+201D> What will it take to solve racial inequality? Not just a war. <U+201C>Futurity<U+201D> combines a vast plethora of subjects with sensitivity and depth, from art, to science, to philosophy. It directly tackles notions of morality, time and singularity <U+2014> to name a few <U+2014> and leaves us asking more questions than it answers.<U+201C>Falling, Failing, Flying<U+201D>Rachel Liu, age 13<U+201C>Will Grayson, meet Will Grayson.<U+201D>The authors David Levithan and John Green (infamously nerdy YA authors of the century) piece together the confusion of meeting someone else with your name and a hilariously realistic comedy featuring a big gay guy, his best friend, another gay guy, and the most fabulous play to ever grace the high school stage.Will 1 is stuck. He<U+2019>s stuck in school, life, and also with Tiny Cooper, who is his (only if you must) best friend. He copes by following two simple but catastrophic rules: 1 <U+2014>Don<U+2019>t care too much. 2 <U+2014>Shut up. His views on Tiny are also simple: <U+201C>Tiny Cooper is not the world<U+2019>s gayest person, and he is not the world<U+2019>s largest person, but I believe he may be the world<U+2019>s largest person who is really, really gay, and also the world<U+2019>s gayest person who is really, really large.<U+201D>Then there<U+2019>s Will 2: alive, but somehow not; seeing, but somehow not. He<U+2019>s <U+201C>constantly torn between killing myself<U+201D> and <U+201C>killing everyone around me,<U+201D> but surviving, solely depending on his friend Isaac for comfort.It<U+2019>s their job to turn each other<U+2019>s lives around by meeting in an abandoned corner tucked away in Chicago.There<U+2019>s something magical about the book: making friends and living inside the moment and taking a risk and the feeling of being a part of something. At the same time, it<U+2019>s not all rainbows and neon colored unicorns galloping across the pages. The two authors illustrate that with love comes pain, and maybe more love, and more pain. It<U+2019>s a dance the characters do around happiness: it doesn<U+2019>t last forever, just like Schr<U+00F6>dinger<U+2019>s Cat (another feature in the book). You either have happiness, or you don<U+2019>t. But to find out, the two Will Graysons along with their friends take a leap of faith across the pages: through fights, discoveries, and the ups and downs of life.Love is an omnipresent thing in the book. Tiny loves love. He falls in love too easily, and it<U+2019>s both his strength and weakness. Will 2 doesn<U+2019>t believe in love. Will 1 falls in love. Tiny sings about love in his play. But throughout the book, none of them know what it<U+2019>s really about. And that<U+2019>s O.K., because as Tiny said, <U+201C>Just fall for once. Let yourself fall!<U+201D>Because if there<U+2019>s one thing I have learned in this book, it<U+2019>s that falling doesn<U+2019>t mean failing. As Will Grayson 2 said, <U+201C>the world is more like try-error-try-error-try-error-try-error-try-error-try<U+2026>at least fifteen more rounds<U+2026>then try-error-try-and finally <U+2014>it.<U+201D> And it will come and hit you one day, brighter than anything you will ever see, because you will get a happy ending out of falling, and you won<U+2019>t break: you<U+2019>ll fly. <U+201C>Synecdoche, New York <U+2014> Charlie Kaufman<U+2019>s Global Oracle<U+201D>Matthew Mandel, age 16As the directorial debut of Charlie Kaufman, notable writer of such universally praised movies as <U+201C>Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind<U+201D> and <U+201C>Being John Malkovich,<U+201D> <U+201C>Synecdoche, New York<U+201D> stands as Kaufman<U+2019>s first opportunity to step out of the writer<U+2019>s chair and take the reigns of an entire theatrical release, giving him full artistic license regarding the film<U+2019>s story line, characters and overarching theme. Kaufman took advantage of this through his commentary on the mind-set of the information age and where society is headed into the future. <U+201C>We<U+2019>re all hurtling toward death, yet here we are for the moment, alive; each of us knowing we<U+2019>re going to die, each of us secretly believing we won<U+2019>t,<U+201D> says Caden Cotard, a fragile, anxious playwright, and the protagonist of <U+201C>Synecdoche, New York,<U+201D> played by Philip Seymour-Hoffman. In the film, Caden is awarded a MacArthur grant, which allows him to finally produce a masterwork which allows him to portray a pure representation of his inner workings (much like Kaufman with this movie). Unfortunately for Caden, this feat will cost him his career and his concentration, as he attempts to recreate every real-world conflict with thousands of actors and scenes within the play. All the while, he deals with issues of romance, fatherhood and aging, fully aware of the results of his every decision and the inevitability of death. Charlie Kaufman utilizes this deeply cognizant character to reflect not only himself, but also everyone living in the information age. In this all-too-nearing future, constant access to public opinion and social ridicule leaves Caden overly self-aware, to the point where he questions his every move and action in the entire movie. He allows his eye for perfection within his play do a number to his physical health, neglecting his humanity for the sake of that which he wishes to share with the world. Could this, too, be the fate of humanity? Doomed to inevitably create our own ideal worlds, where all conflicts reflect our own perspectives, to a degree of tunnel vision wherein we begin to disregard our surroundings? This corresponds both with the director and users of social media, as posts and statuses may be perfected to portray to the world one<U+2019>s best self, whether or not this may be their candid self. A book could be written on the detailed level of allegory utilized in this film, but the best place to begin searching is within the title <U+201C>Synecdoche, New York.<U+201D> Caden creates his own synecdoche, or a part meant to represent the whole, within his uncannily intricate depiction of the world at large. One thing is for sure, Charlie Kaufman<U+2019>s 2008 treasure is sure to perplex, and allow for some deep introspection and self acceptance. <U+201C>Student Short Film Leaves Longlasting Impression<U+201D>Rayna Perry, age 16The student produced short film <U+201C>Home,<U+201D> recently screened at the Savannah Film Festival, follows the story of an elderly Chinese migrant worker, watching over an abandoned construction site, scheduled for demolition. On his last day at the site, a young girl wanders into his midst, and briefly breaks through the old man<U+2019>s closed off demeanor. The film is entirely in Chinese with English subtitles, yet this hardly comes as a distraction to the viewer in ways that subtitles often can. The calm pacing and stunning cinematography mirror that of the lotus pond that rests in the center of the construction site, and acts somewhat as a centerpiece to the film itself. The chemistry of the characters stems not from what they have in common, but in how they differ. The elderly man lives a life of tedium, and struggle, while life to the young city girl, no older than six, is currently one new discovery after another. <U+201C>Home<U+201D> takes its original exploration of homelessness and poverty in modern day China to an even deeper level, as the characters are united by a common search for love and belonging. The elderly man spends most of his time away from family due to the nature of his work, and the young girl is isolated by the unhealthy relationship of her parents. The film attaches the audience to the fleeting bond between the main characters, but in a way that serves to share or inform, rather than relate to those watching the film. Even with the strong emotional pull, the abrupt and almost indifferent ending reminds the viewers that they are, indeed, only spectators. The conflict between the sobering reality of the characters and the audience<U+2019>s desire to see them meet a happy ending truly caused <U+201C>Home<U+201D> to stick with festival goers, even after seeing over a dozen other short films within that hour.  The story candidly tackles universal themes of poverty, loneliness and abandonment, contrasted with those of adventure, and unlikely friendships, without rushing or overloading the viewer. The visual and written aspects of the film are balanced out, so as not to sacrifice a good plot for the sake of showcasing beautiful cinematography, or vice versa. Not only does this standout student film expertly tell the story of a young girl and an elderly man meeting by spontaneous chance, <U+201C>Home<U+201D> prompts audiences to question the true definition of the word. <U+201C><U+2018>Undertale<U+2019> Video Game Review<U+201D>Sean Sawyer, age 14In a market where originality and innovation are rare, Toby Fox<U+2019>s <U+201C>Undertale<U+201D> achieves with one person and $50,000 what no multimillion dollar publisher could. This game is absolutely overflowing with personality, and people have taken notice. At the time of writing, this game is ranked 11th in Best PC Games of All Time on Metacritic, alongside such prestigious titles as <U+201C>Half-Life 2,<U+201D> <U+201C>BioShock<U+201D> and <U+201C>Skyrim.<U+201D> These are games by some of the most skilled designers, programmers and artists with practically infinite budgets, and one quirky little indie game manages to compete with them.At first glance, the main gimmick of <U+201C>Undertale<U+201D> is that the player can choose to kill or spare their enemies in combat. Not unique, considering how many games have similar morality systems. <U+201C>BioShock,<U+201D> <U+201C>Fallout,<U+201D> <U+201C>Mass Effect,<U+201D> and <U+201C>Dishonored<U+201D> all come to mind, but <U+201C>Undertale<U+201D> manages something none of these games had. None of these games legitimately get me to be a good person, and I don<U+2019>t feel bad about doing terrible things in them. <U+201C>Undertale<U+201D> is the first game to make it painful to be a bad person. When I started out, I played this game like I would any RPG. I didn<U+2019>t bother talking to other characters, thinking that they would probably just give me useless information. I killed the enemies that I came across, watching them disintegrate into dust in the same wholesome way that I had come to expect from RPGs. I found out later that for most people, the fight against Toriel (the mother figure who adopts you at the beginning of the story) was a turning point in their playthrough, where they started sparing everyone they could. I didn<U+2019>t have that realization. I killed Toriel, not because I particularly wanted to, but because I thought it was the way to progress the story. The whole game went on like this, and the experience was short, lonely and depressing.At this point, I looked into it some more, breaking my usual rule of not reading about a game while still playing it. I had to have missed something, right? In forum posts and reviews of the game, I found plenty of people who had done the same thing as I did. I started a pacifist playthrough, and finally I realized why people loved this game so much. The characters who I killed last time without a second thought were now friends, and the game seemed to be full of excitement and humor. There was value in being good beyond a few extra points on a karma meter. <U+201C>Undertale<U+201D> dismantles the fluid morality of other RPGs and replaces it with a system where the player<U+2019>s actions have real, substantial consequences.<U+201C><U+2018>My Friend Dahmer': The Young Life of a Murderer<U+201D>Kristina Schafer, age 17Monster. Serial killer. Sicko. I think of these images when I hear the name Jeffrey Dahmer. The terms are, unfortunately, fitting descriptions of who<U+2026> rather, what<U+2026> he came to be. In <U+201C>My Friend Dahmer,<U+201D> author Derf Backderf exposes the adolescent journey of one of the most famed serial killers of our time, from Dahmer<U+2019>s collecting roadkill as a middle-schooler to his committing murder as a newly graduated high school senior.  I picked up this graphic novel expecting a creepy back story of a murderer <U+2014> in all, seventeen young men lost their lives to his bloodlust. Instead, I was shocked to find this reality: his path could have turned in a different direction if the adults in his life had been conscious to his condition. Growing up in the 1970s, Dahmer<U+2019>s world was a bitter hell. He struggled with mental instability that drove him to private insanity as a teenager. His homosexuality was a plague worse than paralysis in an unaccepting era. And as his family split apart at home, Dahmer<U+2019>s descent into darkness became so evident that it affected his friends <U+2014> including Backderf, Dahmer<U+2019>s high school classmate. The isolation of Dahmer at school and failure on the part of his adult figures led him to find grisly methods to satisfy the emotional release he so badly needed. Backderf captures the early days of Dahmer<U+2019>s downward slope toward the brink with startling truth and blunt accuracy. This firsthand account of Dahmer<U+2019>s teenage world is expertly framed by artwork drawn in an awkward, stiff and knobby style, reflecting the insecurities of this time period in Dahmer<U+2019>s life. The shots of each panel play out with smooth synchronicity, like a movie. And what better color scheme to paint the portrait of a fractured existence than the heavy shadows of black and gray? The writer realized this idea by drenching his world in monochrome. This book was constantly in my hands until I had taken in every last picture and word. It grabbed my attention and held it until the end, and even now the story sends shivers down my spine. Because Dahmer was misunderstood, it was too easy for his condition to be overlooked. Backderf led me to see this insidious kind of tragedy: not of a troubled youth, but of an ignorant world. Dahmer devolved from human to monster when people turned away. After reading this, I was no longer tempted to be oblivious. This book leaves its handprint on the reader, no matter their background, walk of life or social standing. Dahmer<U+2019>s tale is a striking one. <U+201C>My Friend Dahmer<U+201D> is an intriguing and disturbingly entertaining read for anyone willing to enter one of history<U+2019>s darkest minds.<U+201C>Man of Mystery <U+2014> A Sherlock Review<U+201D>Maya J. Sekhar, age 14I<U+2019>ve scrutinized the novellas, screened the spinoffs, and although the beloved and brilliant Sherlock Holmes has stood the test of time, I will have to agree with co-director Stephen Moffat in saying, <U+201C>[He] hasn<U+2019>t grown old <U+2014> his times [have].<U+201D>Classic canons, the works of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle have become a commodity in the movie industry <U+2014> replicable mysteries, they are a dime-a-dozen. Would Cumberbatch be the inordinately tame John Barrymore? Or would the series turn into a 48-frame-per-second, Guy Ritchie piece? Naturally, I was dubious upon entering the series.Oh, how wrong I was. Taking place in modern-day London, a young Holmes (Benedict Cumberbatch) shares a flat with John Watson (Martin Freeman) at 221b Baker Street. Watson runs a blog and Sherlock a website. A smartphone is glued to Holmes<U+2019> side for rapid referral, and forensic science is utilized to deduce. Goodbye, telegraphs. Welcome to the 21st century, Sherlock.However, when an incognito bomber strikes Baker Street, the blas<U+00E9> Sherlock is roused from a state of intellectual-boredom, and engaged in an intense, phrenic match, as well as a race to save or sacrifice a multitudinous number of lives. Subsequently, a safe was found, revealing a phone and letter that would explain the madness. Moriarty, an old nemesis, was also consumed by ennui. <U+201C>I<U+2019>m bored,<U+201D> he cackled, <U+201C>we were made for each other, Sherlock!<U+201D>Their game of cat-and-mouse went accordingly<U+2026>. First, a Londoner would be held hostage by the criminal-mastermind, strapped to a bomb. An image, indicating a clue pertaining to a proposed case, would be sent to Holmes<U+2019> mobile. An esoteric message is conveyed from the bomber, through the victim. If the conundrum can be cracked within the allotted time, a person is spared. If not, he or she is blown to smithereens. BLAM!In nine hours<U+2026>Death by botulism is divulged.In eight hours<U+2026>An insurance fraud is exposed.In seconds<U+2026>An art heist is unveiled.Suspense aside, the complexity and relatability of the characters, was intriguing enough to keep me hooked. Tall versus small, social versus sociopath <U+2014> the contrast and chemistry of Watson and Sherlock is worth every moment. The superiority of this adaptation is found in Masterpiece<U+2019>s construction of Holmes.He tells an officer, <U+201C>I<U+2019>m not a psychopath, I<U+2019>m a high-functioning sociopath. Do your research.<U+201D>Cumberbatch is a strikingly rash, yet vulnerable Sherlock <U+2014> causing viewers to question Holmes<U+2019> motivations and mental-soundness, tugging heartstrings along the way. <U+201C>Listen, what I said before John, I meant it,<U+201D> he would mutter, <U+201C>I don<U+2019>t have friends; I<U+2019>ve just got one.<U+201D>One 90-minute-mystery is never enough. This cerebral-thriller will have young and old on the couch for the weekend, unable to pull away, hankering for more.<U+201C>Break The Routine With A Num Pang Bang<U+201D>Alexandra Strimbu, age 17Not many people like out-of-the-ordinary, especially New Yorkers. We get our bagel at the same bodega every day, shop in the same borough every week, hang out at the same park every weekend. We don<U+2019>t like to go out of our way much because we<U+2019>re busy trying to get somewhere else <U+2014> but when we stumble across something amazing, we drop the routine and savor the spontaneity of the experience.On Friday nights, I typically head to a Chipotle to finish off the week with a burrito bowl. So when I turned on 12th Street, I did not expect to find Num Pang Sandwich Shop right next to the place that awaited me. It was tiny, but it caught my eye because of the bright graffiti and the little line that definitely made me rethink mainstream <U+201C>Mexican<U+201D> food. But calling it a small sandwich shop was an understatement. Upon entering, I realized the place was a miniature flavor factory with warm, ethnic scents dancing in the air with the music that played under the soft lighting.The sandwich menu went beyond a New York BLT <U+2014> Hoisin Meatballs, Coconut Tiger Shrimp, and Ginger Barbecue Brisket were only some of the mouthwatering items listed above me. There was also a section on the menu that listed rice bowls, and since that was my original mission, I ordered one with roasted chicken. The colorful juices displayed before me also prompted me to buy their Sweet Mango juice.The bowl was larger than I expected, and was filled with colorful vegetables, chili yogurt and chive lime vinaigrette that sat upon the chicken and jasmine rice. The flavor factory truly worked its magic into every single bite. The chicken was lightly seasoned and didn<U+2019>t take away from the vegetables or dressings, which were perfectly balanced by the warm jasmine rice. The mango juice added just the right touch to the food, providing an oasis of sweetness when I took a break from the artistic blend of spices on my fork. If Chipotle and halal food had a baby, that food baby wouldn<U+2019>t compare to that Cambodian rice bowl I had not intended to buy that Friday night. I could juice my own mangoes at home, but my product would taste nowhere as refreshing as that Sweet Mango juice did.New Yorkers have been globally labeled busybodies thriving on the same old, same old. But Num Pang is not the same old ethnic food. Sometimes, having a spontaneous change of mind can really open your comfort zone in ways you<U+2019>ve never tasted. Num Pang<U+2019>s ambience and cuisine is both spontaneous and inviting <U+2014> two ingredients for any dish that<U+2019>s worth remembering.<U+201C>Leaving Listeners Wiped Out! with Emotions<U+201D>Ella Weeks, age 14Entitled <U+201C>Wiped Out!,<U+201D> The Neighbourhood<U+2019>s latest album makes a splash. This Californian band, known for wrapping together jazzy textures, smashing beats, indie style, moody lyrics and the raspy voice of Jesse Rutherford, has got the attention of both teenage girls and alternative music fans. Released on October 30th, <U+201C>Wiped Out!<U+201D> doesn<U+2019>t fail to address signature themes of California, the beach and Rutherford<U+2019>s father and ex-girlfriends <U+2014> yet explores an unexpected direction for the band. Press play, and you<U+2019>ll find you<U+2019>ve paid $1.29 for 34 seconds of silence. Whether for respect or to prolong the wait for the highly anticipated release, it starts off with the mysterious and somewhat appalling <U+201C>Moment of Silence.<U+201D> The album then plummets into a four-song mini-collection (<U+201C>Prey,<U+201D> <U+201C>Cry Baby,<U+201D> <U+201C>Wiped Out!,<U+201D> and <U+201C>The Beach<U+201D>) of Rutherford<U+2019>s identity-induced pain <U+2014> something surprising for listeners. He sings, <U+201C>I got the pressure that<U+2019>s pushing my buttons and making me think about death,<U+201D> in <U+201C>Wiped Out!<U+201D> and <U+201C>I<U+2019>m sick and I<U+2019>m tired too<U+2026>/ I hope I don<U+2019>t murder me / I hope I don<U+2019>t burden you<U+201D> in <U+201C>The Beach.<U+201D> Although Rutherford<U+2019>s lyrics feel earnest, they<U+2019>re harsh for the more casual listener. But the album then dips into the band<U+2019>s more familiar side with songs like: <U+201C>Daddy Issues,<U+201D> a velvety ode to Rutherford<U+2019>s deceased father; <U+201C>Greetings from Califournia,<U+201D> a haunting and bass-heavy piece not unlike <U+201C>Let it Go<U+201D> off their 2012 EP <U+201C>Thank You<U+201D>; and closing track <U+201C>R.I.P. 2 My Youth,<U+201D> the sinister hit about the band<U+2019>s death of innocence. These songs rekindle the classic, melodious sounds of The Neighbourhood, as does <U+201C>Baby Came Home 2 / Valentines,<U+201D> the standout sequel to <U+201C>Baby Came Home<U+201D> off their breakout EP <U+201C>I<U+2019>m Sorry<U+2026>.<U+201D> <U+201C>She was five foot four with some money on the floor in a box that<U+2019>s hidden under her bed / I was only twenty-two with a pocket full of truth but I gave her everything that I had,<U+201D> Rutherford writes. The combination of mysterious lines and aching guitar chords give the sequel the sensuality and pain of the very relationship it<U+2019>s written about.Overall, the album adds a new flavor of distress. But the incorporation of the band<U+2019>s styles isn<U+2019>t as strong as it was on their last album <U+201C>I Love You,<U+201D> and neither are the lyrics. While some painful lines require a less casual listener to be enjoyed, the album<U+2019>s seamless tone outweighs complaints. The sounds are heavy, moody, intoxicating and catchy; The Neighbourhood is still as captivating as ever. <U+201C>Wiped Out!<U+201D> evokes the feeling of being young, emotional and reckless underneath California<U+2019>s palm trees <U+2014> even for those who have never visited the state.Runners-up<U+201C>Transforming The Black Narrative One Exhibition At a Time<U+201D>Labiba Chowdhury, age 18Fairy tales and myths allow us to escape the stress of our realities and enter magical worlds where anything is possible. Unfortunately, these stories are dominantly a white narrative with a disappointing absence of people-of-color characters. Although these stories are meant to allow one to escape into magical worlds, as a person of color, these worlds seem to be out of reach. Occasionally there will be one <U+201C>token black person<U+201D> that you will hold onto like a key into a world with an uncomfortable lack of color. But even then, you are rarely in the center. <U+201C>Unveiling Visions: The Alchemy of the Black Imagination,<U+201D> an art exhibit in the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in Harlem, opens the door into a world where stories of the past, present, and future, not only include black people, but place them in the center.   <U+201C>Unveiling Visions<U+201D> begins with artwork showcasing futuristic depictions of black characters. The oil paintings and digital media create a unique aesthetic that combines futuristic metallic wear with tribal print. It is not a common sight in media to see a strong black woman in a red dress decorated with metallic embroidery as in <U+201C>Do Androids Dream of How People Sleep?<U+201D> by Krista Franklin, for example. The exhibit included artwork that created a mystical world of strong black characters with magical powers. Images of black mermaids, warriors and sorcerers decorated the walls. <U+201C>Cosmic Traveller<U+201D> by Julie Dillon is one such piece that stood out to me. The mix of reds and blues with a serene sorceress in the center, leaves me feeling that I would probably feel safe in a universe with a heroine like her protecting me. The exhibition did not leave out our present story of racial strife, however. One of my favorite pieces was a movie poster <U+201C>Attack of the 14 year old Black Girl.<U+201D> <U+201C>Unveiling Visions<U+201D> is an exhibition that anyone who wants to gaze into a window of a more colorful human story, must go to see. <U+201C><U+2018>Gone<U+2019> Series a Riveting Page Turner<U+201D>Anna Cox, age 17It sounded like a corny dystopian novel: kids with superpowers! No adults! <U+201C>The Hunger Games<U+201D> with super speed and telekinesis! My inclination toward reading <U+201C>Gone<U+201D> by Michael Grant was minimal at first, but within a week, I had bought and finished all six books in the addicting series. The <U+201C>Gone<U+201D> series is not a cheap work of science fiction or a <U+201C>Hunger Games<U+201D> knockoff; instead, it<U+2019>s a frightening, gripping tale of chaos and control with a terrifying picture that everyone in the novel is under fifteen years old. Though some parts are marked by clich<U+00E9>s, the series is impossible to put down and brings the reader on a wild, chaotic trip. The series centers on Perdido Beach, California, a small beach town that appears to have two significant landmarks: Coates, a private school for rich, troubled kids and a nuclear power plant. And one day, a third appears: a dome that encircles the town. At the same time, everyone aged fifteen and older simply vanishes into thin air. The kids are left to fend for themselves in the town, nicknamed the <U+201C>FAYZ,<U+201D> with no answers as to why it has happened. As some children develop supernatural powers like healing and super strength, factions form among them. They must learn to survive without food and eventually electricity. Though never unnecessarily gory, Grant is unafraid to describe the mental and physical tortures the kids experience, oft inflicted by one another. Each novel presents a new curse upon the town. The situations are terrifying and none take pity on the age of the residents, making the books difficult at times to read, but still riveting with well-written action scenes and climaxes. Although sometimes written predictably, no character is one-dimensional. The hero Sam Temple struggles with his power and rejects his authority; the healer Lana Lazar<U+2019>s mental tortures and her actions from them make her both a sympathized and hated character. Despicable Drake Merwin is not just a figurehead because the novel needs a villain; he is pure evil and malice, ranking up there with Hannibal Lecter. His psychotic actions strike fear into every scene. While the end result of many battles and the series in some ways predictable, what makes the tales so gripping is that the means to get there are not. Every page is filled with surprises <U+2014> no character is safe from death, injury, or mental torture. Clich<U+00E9> relationships are easily forgiven for its page-turning chaos. It<U+2019>s easy to find yourself rooting for every character, even if their interests conflict with each other. You want to see these poor kids win. You want to see them stay alive. For a thrilling read, pick up <U+201C>Gone<U+201D>: you won<U+2019>t regret it. <U+201C>Blindness: A Blindfolded Expedition<U+201D>Joaquin, age 17Isn<U+2019>t it astonishing how words on a page can completely confuse you, completely disgust you and completely move you? Jos<U+00E9> Saramago has written a grotesque, dystopian, inspiring mental picture book that will forever leave an imprint on the eyes of my mind. The <U+201C>white blindness<U+201D> (an epidemic of chronic blindness) that slowly consumes the population mirrors the effect this writing has had on my thoughts.It is impossible to discuss this book without discussing the structure. Admittedly, I found myself confused within the first chapters "
6,https://news.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/10/30/morning-agenda-valeant-drops-philidor/,10/30/15,"VALEANT DROPS PHILIDOR  |  Valeant Pharmaceuticals said Friday it was dropping a mail-order pharmacy at the center of a growing controversy over its dispensing relationship with the drug maker, The New York Times reports. The pharmacy, Philidor Rx Services, <U+201C>will shut down operations as soon as possible,<U+201D> Valeant said in a news release.The move came after the three largest American drug benefit managers, Express Scripts, CVS Health Health and OptumRx, said they would stop paying for drugs dispensed by the pharmacy, as Andrew Pollack reports.<U+201C>The newest allegations about activities at Philidor raise additional questions about the company<U+2019>s business practices,<U+201D> J. Michael Pearson, Valeant<U+2019>s chairman and chief executive, said in the news release. <U+201C>We have lost confidence in Philidor<U+2019>s ability to continue to operate in a manner that is acceptable to Valeant and the patients and doctors we serve.<U+201D>DEAL-MAKING FRENZY IN THE HEALTH CARE SECTOR  |  Pfizer<U+2019>s efforts to renounce its citizenship by buying a foreign rival could lead to a messy fight with lawmakers in Washington, asMichael J. de la Merced and Leslie Picker report in DealBook.The prospect of a deal between Pfizer and Allergan has already attracted criticism from Capitol Hill. Pfizer<U+2019>s tax rate will be about 25 percent this year and Ian C. Read, the chief executive, has made no secret of his disdain for it. He says it leaves Pfizer at a competitive disadvantage against foreign rivals. Pfizer has already tried to reduce its taxes through an inversion, in which it buys a company headquartered abroad and moves its corporate home there. It approached AstraZeneca, but the takeover fell apart and prompted the Treasury department to tighten guidelines and make inversions less appealing. But that did not dent Mr. Read<U+2019>s interest. Now Pfizer is taking aim at Allergan, which is domiciled in Ireland and reported an effective tax rate of just 4.8 percent last year. Its tax rate this year is about 15 percent.The new Treasury rules mean that an inversion would need a larger target to be beneficial. Allergan<U+2019>s shareholders would need to own 40 percent of the combined company. This means they will have to be creative about the structure of the deal as Pfizer<U+2019>s market value is nearly twice the size of Allergan<U+2019>s. Allergan has the upper hand in this situation, John Foley writes in Breakingviews. It would only have 34 percent of the combined group based on their latest traded values so Pfizer would need to pay a premium out of whatever savings it hoped to make on its taxable profit. Allergan could demand a big chunk of that itself. Pfizer may well decide to squeeze more value out of the deal by cutting costs at Allergan, but Brent Saunders, Allergan<U+2019>s chief executive, may well prefer to do that through acquisitions of his own.  If successful, the talks could lead to the biggest deal of the year, after a booming $270 billion worth of mergers and acquisitions just in the first nine months of 2015 in the United States. Health care companies from drug makers to insurers are frantically circling to avoid missing out on the deal making frenzy, Reed Abelson writes in DealBook.The tax aspects are important in this deal, but companies across the health care sector are also buying each other up fueled by low interest rates, cheap capital and a need to restructure in response to changes under the Affordable Care Act. Even hospitals are supersizing and Accenture predicts that they will start buying specialty medical groups, adding clinics or digital health companies to their structures.THE LONG SHADOW OF EUROPEAN BANKS  |  The role played by Europe<U+2019>s banks in damping the mood on the Continent was on full display when Deutsche Bank announced its overhaul,Peter Eavis reports in DealBook.It had made efforts to adapt and harbored ambitions to continue being a dominant player on Wall Street, but its returns had fallen well below its peers there. Companies in the United States borrow heavily in the bond markets as well as from banks, so when banks faltered after the crisis, companies still had a deep pool of capital to tap. European companies, however, rely heavily on bank loans so the banks need to be in good shape if the continent is to see sustained growth. European banks avoided a thorough cleanup until they had to start subjecting themselves to regulatory examinations last year. The amount of nonperforming loans they have on their books is equivalent to roughly 10 percent of the gross domestic product of the eurozone and this may have weighed on the region<U+2019>s economic performance.Deutsche Bank shows why the European financial system may take a while to catch up but its latest strategic change may be a sign that even a powerful bank that pushed back hard against postcrisis regulations sees no alternative but to adopt the streamlining that has made banks more efficient in the United States. ON THE AGENDA  |  Pershing Square Capital Management will hold a conference call to discuss its investment in Valeant Pharmaceuticals at 9 a.m. The Federal Reserve board meets at 2:30 p.m. to discuss rules on loss-absorbing capacity and long-term debt at banks and margin and capital requirements for uncleared swaps.RUSHCARD TO REIMBURSE CUSTOMERS  |  RushCard, the prepaid debit card company plagued with technology problems this month, said it would pay $2 million to $3 million to refund customers for losses and inconvenience,Liz Moyer reports in DealBook.The amount in the reimbursement fund would vary depending on how many people take up the refund, executives said. It will not be releasing details until it gets regulatory approval. <U+201C>We take accountability,<U+201D> said Rick Savard, RushCard<U+2019>s chief executive.Mr. Savard said RushCard was in contact with regulators and would have a number of meetings with them about what happened and how it could be remedied. RushCard had already announced that it would eliminate card fees for current and new customers from now until the end of February 2016. Executives said the costs of the reimbursement fund and the lost fee revenue would amount to the company<U+2019>s profits for this year, which they said was its best ever.Mr. Savard said the process for filing for a refund through the reimbursement fund should be up and running in a few weeks. The technical problem had occurred while RushCard was converting its systems to MasterCard<U+2019>s processing platform and that had cascaded into its other technology.

7,https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/08/28/can-republicans-paint-the-white-house-red/,8/28/13,"Democrats may dream of 16 years of dominance, but on Nov. 8, 2016, it is entirely possible that Americans will elect a Republican president. It is even possible, although less likely, that Republicans will be in full control of the federal government: the White House, the Senate, the House of Representatives and the Supreme Court.A dominant theme in contemporary political commentary on the left, the right and the center is that the Republican Party faces a grave crisis of both demographics and ideology. But despite the cacophony of fault finding, caution is in order before we declare the Republican Party down for the count. To explore the possibility of a Republican revival in 2016, I spoke with a number of Republican strategists, including Stuart Stevens, who ran the Romney campaign in 2012; Patrick Ruffini, president of Engage, a digital consulting company; and Bill McInturff, founder of Public Opinion Strategies.Stevens is a critic of the doom-and-gloom approach. He argues that a successful 2016 Republican presidential scenario can be credibly pieced together. Here are some of the hypotheticals that might lead to victory.One, Hillary Clinton chooses not to run or, as was the case in 2008, falls flat in the primaries and caucuses. This would leave Democrats with second-tier candidates, none of whom can inspire the overall turnout or the specific margins enjoyed by President Obama.Two, public discontent with Obamacare grows. Young voters, a key to recent Democratic victories, bristle over the requirement to buy insurance or pay a fine. Corporate plans cut spousal coverage. Businesses replace full-time workers with part-timers, ineligible for benefits.<U+00A0>Health insurance premiums continue to rise faster than inflation. The discontent with the Affordable Care Act on the part of the three major unions <U+2013> the Teamsters, United Food and Commercial Workers and Unite-Here <U+2013> spreads throughout the labor movement. Glitches in rolling out the massive new health care program increase public opposition (the regulations governing the hiring of health care <U+201C>navigators<U+201D> to help consumers enroll total an estimated 13,900 words in the Federal Register). Increasing numbers of people cannot keep either their current doctor or their health care plan.Three, the stock market and corporate profits rise, but employment continues to lag; more people drop out of the work force; the job market continues to bifurcate, with work at the high and low ends, but less and less in the middle.Four, the Republican primary electorate does not nominate Ted Cruz of Texas or Rand Paul of Kentucky and instead picks Jeb Bush or another mainstream nominee.Ruffini puts the case for 50-50 odds in 2016 in terms of his view that Hillary Clinton is the likely nominee, noting that she carries substantial baggage. <U+201C>Clinton<U+2019>s currently favorable political position,<U+201D> Ruffini wrote me, is a function of the aftermath of the 2008 campaign, where she gained in popularity amongst Republicans as a Democratic foil to Obama, and stayed above the partisan fray as secretary of state. In 2016, that dynamic will no longer apply.In addition, he said, No one wants to say that Hillary Clinton is too old to be president; she is not. But there is a demonstrable bias in recent presidential elections towards a younger candidate being able to successfully contrast stylistically against an older one. Especially if the public mood pivots back towards change in 2016, this is something Clinton will need to navigate, as it seems likely right now that the Republican candidate will personify a generational shift in the electorate. Finally, it should be remembered that we saw how Clinton performed on the campaign trail in 2008 and the results weren<U+2019>t good.Ruffini<U+2019>s bottom line:Clinton is a formidable candidate who can rely on historic levels of support among women and can raise hundreds of millions of dollars online even before the general election. The celebrity factor will propel her. But she won<U+2019>t be able to defy gravity forever.It<U+2019>s relatively easy to draw up a counter-scenario in which Republican prospects in 2016 are dim. Let<U+2019>s say:Just as important, the Electoral College, which throughout the years of Republican ascendancy from the late <U+2019>60s into the early <U+2019>90s tilted to the right, now leans to the left. This map of the United States, <U+201C>The Big Blue Wall,<U+201D> was put together by the Republican polling firm Public Opinion Strategies:The Republican Party<U+2019>s difficulties have prompted some sympathetic analysts to call for a reversal of trickle-down economic policies. Michael Gerson, a former speechwriter for George W. Bush, and Peter Wehner of the Ethics and Public Policy Center argue that Republicans should become visible and persistent critics of corporate welfare: the vast network of subsidies and tax breaks extended by Democratic and Republican administrations alike to wealthy and well-connected corporations.Even Karl Rove, the chief political adviser to an administration that passed two tax cuts favoring the affluent, has caught the populist bug, arguing <U+201C>there is too much corporate welfare and there are too many breaks that benefit the big guys and the people who<U+2019>ve already got it.<U+201D> With no evident embarrassment, Rove told an Aspen Institute conference on the future of the Republican Party:So we got a tax system that benefits the big guy over the little guy and we need to reform it and we got a government with way too much benefits that flow to the people who<U+2019>ve got the money that keeps us from providing the resources necessary to the people who don<U+2019>t have money and also keeps us all paying too much in taxes, because they<U+2019>re running up too much of debt, because most of that corporate welfare, if not all of it, is being paid for by borrowed money we don<U+2019>t have.David Leege, an emeritus professor of political science at the University of Notre Dame, believes Republicans have a good shot in 2016 because their disparate and often conflicting factions <U+201C>will unite around an even more elemental fear <U+2014> threats to the preservation of white male rule.<U+201D> Leege argues in an e-mail to The Times:2016 could look good for Reps. They are the party of fresh faces. Dems are the party of old faces. Reps have taken advantage of Citizens United and will (illegally) do as good a job of coordinating almost limitless gifts between PACs and the candidate<U+2019>s campaign organization, as the Dems did in 2012 with <U+201C>limited<U+201D> funds.Steve Ansolabehere, a political scientist at Harvard, is even more bullish on Republican prospects: I think they have a better than 50-50 shot at the presidency. It is very hard for a party to win the presidency three times in a row <U+2014> since WW II, only the run of Reagan-Bush. There are a lot of divisions in the G.O.P., but there is no shortage of respectable candidates.The post-World War II historical record favors a Republican victory in 2016, according to David Mayhew, a political scientist at Yale. He pointed out that in five of the six <U+201C>open<U+201D> elections since World War II (open meaning without an incumbent candidate), the candidate representing the party holding the White House lost. In 2016, the Democratic nominee will fit that definition. Mayhew noted, however, that six elections is too small a sample from which to draw strong conclusions.Both Mayhew and Arthur Lupia, a political scientist at the University of Michigan, contend that Republican power brokers should be able to force enough of a change in the direction of the party to be competitive. Lupia wrote in an e-mail responding to a Times inquiry asking him to assess the competitive strength of the parties:Establishment Republicans have room to extend their base and their appeal. The incremental changes that we are seeing on issues such as immigration, same-sex marriage and climate change set the stage for a person with conservative bona fides to draw support from the ideological center of the U.S. population. Slight changes in G.O.P. primary rules and more strategic use of money by establishment Republican money people will give centrists more advantages than they had in 2008 and 2012.Along parallel lines, Mayhew wrote:Generally speaking, out-parties adapt. They take advantage of various party-in-office erosions, they adjust to changing demographics, and they play a good game in candidate choice and issue positioning.The issues at play in presidential campaigns are often different from those in House and Senate races. Control of the Senate could turn out to be a bigger hurdle for the Republican Party than winning the White House. Republicans have a decent chance of taking control next year, but even if they do, the party will have a tough time retaining control in 2016.The view among nonpartisan election experts on the 2014 Senate races is generally similar. Charlie Cook described the odds asa little less than 50-50 for G.O.P. takeover. Don<U+2019>t know if you have seen our Senate math worksheet. Republicans have a very narrow but not uphill path to a majority. They have to almost run the table, but the states aren<U+2019>t tough ones.Stuart Rothenberg, editor and publisher of The Rothenberg Political Report, told me that he expects Republicans to pick up from three to six seats. <U+201C>As you know, the Rs need to net six seats to take the Senate. So we characterize the Senate as <U+2018>in play.<U+2019><U+201D>Larry Sabato, a professor of political science at the University of Virginia, wrote in an e-mailed response to a Times inquiry:I look at it this way. Heavy odds that Republicans will pick up seats, net, in 2014. Right now, it looks like +3 or +4. They need +6 to gain control. So Democrats are early slight favorites to retain control of the Senate. All the Republicans need, though, is a medium-sized wave to take 6. They already probably have W.V., S.D., and Mont. <U+2014> currently all D seats with vacating incumbents. It<U+2019>s 50-50 in Ark. for Sen. Mark Pryor (D) vs. Rep. Tom Cotton (R). Sens. Mary Landrieu (D-La.) and Mark Begich (D-Ark.) are slight favorites to hold their seats <U+2014> but a medium wave could unseat them. That<U+2019>s potentially +6 for the G.O.P.Cook, Rothenberg and Sabato are looking at the 2014 Senate contests. In 2016, however, the advantage in Senate elections will shift back to the Democrats. Of the 34 Senators up for election, 24 are Republicans, including those holding seats in highly competitive states like New Hampshire, Iowa, Wisconsin, Ohio, Illinois and Pennsylvania. The only 2016 Democratic seats in toss-up states are in Nevada and Colorado.The ingredient missing so far in this discussion of the future of the Republican Party is the American business community. The Republican Party has been the political home of corporate America for generations.At the moment, the Tea Party faction has become a major problem for business interests on at least three fronts. First, by blocking immigration reform, a top priority of the business lobby. Second, by calling for rejection of legislation raising the debt ceiling, the Tea Party promotes economic uncertainty, and uncertainty is itself anathema to commercial interests. Third, the radicalism of the Tea Party threatens the viability of the Republican Party, the political arm of business.The future of the Republican Party will in large part be determined by the outcome of the internal struggle between the Tea Party faction and the pro-business establishment wing. Over the long haul, this is not a fight between equals. Prospects favor a revived pro-business, anti-regulatory Republican Party that purposefully narrowcasts <U+2014> that is, carefully restricts to a select audience <U+2014> its focus on divisive social and cultural issues, just as the Democratic Party, which had lost three presidential elections in a row, lowered its liberal profile in the 1990s. The compelling mandate for a national political party in the United States is not to serve as ideological advocate, but to win."
8,https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/11/06/in-los-angeles-unions-show-signs-of-life/,11/6/14,"Gabriela Ochoa is a vivacious woman who buses tables at the Landings Restaurant at the Holiday Inn near Los Angeles International Airport, a job she has held since 2001.This year has been a good year for Ochoa, 45, and her husband, who is a supervisor at a vegetable packing company. They have two adult children, a teenager and 6-year-old twins, and they can afford to give the twins treats. <U+201C>I can take them to IHOP or to the aquarium,<U+201D> she said. She hadn<U+2019>t seen her family in Mexico for years, but this summer Ochoa, her husband and the twins took a two-week vacation to Michoac<U+00E1>n to visit them.She can get herself a new pair of sneakers without worrying about the money. The family owns its house. <U+201C>My older children joke that they didn<U+2019>t have what the kids have now,<U+201D> she said. <U+201C>Now the twins have more food in the fridge, a gallon of milk instead of a small carton, more toys. I take them to Chuck E. Cheese.<U+201D>Ochoa can do these things because in 2006, the City Council passed a law mandating a $10.64 hourly wage and health benefits for hotel workers on Century Boulevard, the corridor of 13 large hotels just outside the entrance to LAX. After legal squabbles, it went into effect in 2008.Ochoa<U+2019>s salary has gone up to $12.16 an hour, plus tips shared by the waiters. The living-wage law, however, isn<U+2019>t as important to that increase as unionization has been. Last year, Unite Here Local 11, a union of hotel, restaurant and airport workers with about 20,000 members, unionized the Holiday Inn. Now she also has a guaranteed 40-hour workweek and health insurance for her family.A few years ago, her situation was very different. She started work at $7.15 per hour, and when the law was passed had been making $9.15 <U+2014> plus tips, but work was scant. <U+201C>Sometimes we<U+2019>d go in and after three hours, they<U+2019>d say, <U+2018>O.K., we have no more work today, go home.<U+2019><U+201C>We hardly ate. We bought what was on special <U+2014> rice, pasta, beans, milk a tiny carton at a time.<U+201D> Sometimes she went to her church for food packages. They owned a house, but couldn<U+2019>t keep up payments, and lost it. <U+201C>I was always anxious <U+2014> the money is going to run out.<U+201D>What happened to Ochoa is starting to happen all over the United States. Not unionization: The decline of organized labor is accelerating. It used to be that a third of private sector workers belonged to a union. Now one in 20 does.<U+00A0> The unionization rate has not been this low since 1916.Unite Here is growing in Los Angeles, however, especially in the LAX zone, where it has unionized five hotels since 2007. Ochoa is enthusiastically active in the union, and I met her on a picket line outside the Westin Los Angeles Airport hotel. About 60 hotel workers were on a one-day strike with signs and bullhorns, marching back and forth chanting the classic labor slogans in Spanish. It seemed like a throwback, a relic of the past.But this week, four states passed new laws raising the minimum wage: Arkansas, Alaska, South Dakota and Nebraska. You could call it one of the few bright spots for Democrats <U+2014> except that it<U+2019>s really not a Democratic issue any more. These laws passed overwhelmingly even in Republican states <U+2014> because they bypassed state legislatures and went straight to voters.More than 120 cities, including conservative ones like San Diego, have living-wage laws, most of them affecting workers in businesses that contract with or receive subsidies from the city. Los Angeles was one of the first, in 1997. Mayor Bill de Blasio just expanded (pdf) New York City<U+2019>s law to cover more workers in September.Also in September, the Los Angeles City Council approved a minimum hourly wage of $15.37 for workers at all big hotels in Los Angeles <U+2014> it will take effect next year. Mayor Eric Garcetti wants to raise the minimum wage for all workers in the city to $13.25 per hour over the next three years.Los Angeles has focused on hotel workers because hotels get lots of city help and benefits. But it<U+2019>s also because hotel workers are among the poorest in the city <U+2014> the new law<U+2019>s preamble says that 43 percent of hotel workers in Los Angeles earn wages that put them <U+201C>far below the federal poverty line.<U+201D> And hotel workers in the LAX corridor earned 20 percent below the average hotel worker in Los Angeles County.What is happening in the airport zone is an intersection of unionization and rising wages for all that used to be commonplace. In the 1940s, when unions were at their peak, they lifted wages not only for their members, but for workers who didn<U+2019>t belong to a union. Jake Rosenfeld, the author of the new book <U+201C>What Unions No Longer Do,<U+201D> writes that nonunion workplaces would often match the wages and benefits of union shops. One reason they did it, of course, was to keep out the union.<U+00A0>But Rosenthal, who is an associate professor of sociology at the University of Washington, argues that other companies copied the practices of industry leaders <U+2014> and those leaders tended to be unionized.The decline of unions has led to lower wages because fewer workers now make union scale. But Rosenthal says that unions have lost their ability to influence whole industries. Companies still mimic industry leaders <U+2014> but those leaders are not unionized.Organized labor is still a force for raising wages <U+2014> it<U+2019>s happening now largely through its support of living-wage laws. A small part of this is self-interest. Despite their low salaries, for example, big hotels pay considerably better than small ones, and offer more opportunities for advancement. But almost everywhere, living-wage laws apply only to big hotels <U+2014> the new Los Angeles citywide hotel living-wage law will apply next year only to hotels with more than 300 rooms. It will expand to hotels with more than 125 rooms in 2016.The obvious reason is that big hotels are more able to absorb the impact of paying higher salaries. Less obviously, big hotels are the plum targets for unionization, and many of the laws contain clauses allowing workers to waive the wage increases as part of collective bargaining agreements. The $15 living-wage law covering Seattle<U+2019>s SeaTac airport region which passed last year was <U+201C>an incentive for employers to collectively bargain with their employees,<U+201D> according to the Union of Food and Commercial Workers<U+2019> newsletter. The LAX living-wage law may be one reason Unite Here has been so successful in the zone. Once, the labor movement created higher wages for all. Now higher wages for all are helping to keep the labor movement alive.Some opponents of unions use this to try to discredit living-wage laws. But these laws are far more than an organizing tool. Unions have provided the ground troops and often the financing for living wage campaigns around the United States <U+2014> even though their members are usually making above that line and don<U+2019>t benefit <U+2014> because these laws have the potential to make life a little better for millions of workers. As this goal becomes harder and harder to achieve through unionization, organized labor has found other ways.I met more people on the picket line. One was Regla Soto. She came from Cuba in 1980 and has been cleaning rooms at the Westin for 27 years. Her husband, now retired, worked in housekeeping at the Hilton. She used to arrive at home vomiting from anxiety. The family ate meat once a week. The children would ask for clothes and toys their friends had, and Soto could only shake her head. She went to church to get food packets.They managed, with difficulty, until one of her three children died of cancer. <U+201C>I had to choose between burying him and paying for the house,<U+201D> she said. <U+201C>I had to give him a Christian burial.<U+201D> The burial cost $14,000, she said. She took out loans, fell behind on payments, and lost the house.Since then, the living-wage law was passed and Unite Here unionized the Westin. Now Soto makes $14.11 an hour, with time and a half for overtime, and health insurance for the family. They own a house in Compton. After her son<U+2019>s death Soto and her husband formally adopted his daughter. She is now in college, and Soto is able to pay for her books. She has auto insurance now and has plans to send her granddaughter to Arizona for a graduate degree and buy a new living room set. She still goes to church <U+2014> now only to pray.Join Fixes on Facebook and follow updates on twitter.com/nytimesfixes.

9,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/31/business/crossfit-offers-an-exercise-in-corporate-teamwork-too.html,3/31/13,"AT 12:30 p.m. on a Tuesday, the chief executive of Datalogix was spider-crawling across a conference room floor. All around him, account managers and data analysts were thrusting 20-pound medicine balls overhead, while their Spandex-clad co-workers sprinted up and down the lobbys carpeted staircase.A panting, red-faced software developer rested against a railing as a colleague rushed past. Push it, Karin! she cried in encouragement. Minutes later, having regained her strength, the developer was back in the conference room, completing her fourth set of jumping squats while a muscle-bound trainer studied her form.Since the summer of 2010, Datalogix, a Big Data company in Westminster, Colo., has offered these classes, called CrossFit, twice a week for its employees. CrossFit gained early popularity among law enforcement officers and military personnel, but lately, both large and small businesses  judging that fitness programs can bolster employee morale, improve productivity and reduce health insurance premiums  have taken an interest. This fast-growing fitness trend combines weight lifting, gymnastics and endurance training and has attracted more than 10 million practitioners around the world, according to the company, about 60 percent of them women.My enthusiasm for CrossFit knows no bounds, said Eric Roza, 45, Datalogixs supremely fit and upbeat chief executive. In fact, his enthusiasm led him to open with his wife a 10,000-square-foot gym in downtown Boulder, Colo., called CrossFit Sanitas, where he generally works out at 5:30 a.m., five days a week, though he will occasionally join his employees, too.Mr. Roza used to run 100-mile ultramarathons, but he took up CrossFit after an injury in 2008. I got hooked instantly, he said after the conference-room workout, his army-green T-shirt damp with sweat. It was like crack or heroin. So when some Datalogix employees organized their own weight-loss competition three years ago, to see who could lose the most pounds, Mr. Roza began offering CrossFit classes in-house. He hired Pat Burke, the owner of another local CrossFit gym  or box, as its often called because of its spare, no-frills design  to teach the classes.Mr. Burke, a former Marine, brings in barbells, gymnastics rings and medicine balls, depending on the days workout. To vary the routine, he might show up with tractor tires, which Datalogix staff members flip and pound with sledgehammers in the parking lot as their less gung-ho colleagues stare from the windows. Mr. Roza estimates that 50 of the 200 employees at Datalogixs headquarters have taken part in the CrossFit classes. The participants, who sign a waiver of liability for injury, have shed around 300 pounds collectively  or at least that is the figure that Mr. Roza derived from informal employee interviews.There are other, less quantifiable benefits. Karin Eisenmenger, 46, Datalogixs director of order management and the woman running up the stairs past her panting colleague, says the classes unite people from different departments who might otherwise never meet. If you can sweat and groan and moan with your co-workers, she said, youll have no problem working with them in a meeting.Ben Nelson, 31, an information technology analyst who says he lost 60 pounds after he started CrossFit in 2010, said a lunch hour spent doing squat thrusts and swinging kettlebells enabled him to work longer and with greater focus. I used to work for the Dish Network, he said, and the workouts there were running up and down the stairs on the way to company meetings.CROSSFIT is one of many perks at Datalogix, where a range of other options  like self-defense classes and courses in the Java programming language  are available free and in-house. The companys fitness initiatives, called DLX Fit, cost the company around $25,000 a year, Mr. Roza said. A majority of that goes toward CrossFit.Ive been calling CrossFit the new golf, Mr. Roza said. You wouldnt believe how often it comes up in business meetings.CrossFit was started in 2000 in Santa Cruz, Calif., by Greg Glassman, a former gymnastics coach. Over the next decade, it grew from a single gym to a global workout craze. (There are now 42 CrossFit boxes in South Africa alone.) In 2010, a partnership with Reebok further raised CrossFits profile. Reebok has built 15 gyms inside or near its offices around the world, and plans to open 11 more. In most cases, Reebok employees receive their membership at a discount.The largest gym  known as Reebok CrossFit One, a cavernous, 12,000-square-foot space with six on-site coaches, 14 climbing ropes and one cargo climbing net, among other equipment  is at Reeboks headquarters in Canton, Mass. According to Chris Froio, Reeboks global head of fitness and training, more than 300 employees visit the gym every day. Like most CrossFit gyms, CrossFit One offers classes for a variety of skill levels, and workouts are scaled according to ability.So it isnt unusual to find Anne McKay, 74, an accounting clerk, carrying five-pound sandbags beside Kenneth Gamble, a former running back for the Kansas City Chiefs and a Reebok executive, whose sandbags of choice often exceed 100 pounds.Such exertions, without appropriate supervision, can lead to injuries. In 2008, Makimba Mimms, a former Navy information systems technician, sued a World Gym, a CrossFit affiliate training company and one of its employees in Manassas, Va., contending that an especially intense CrossFit workout caused a condition in which muscle fibers deteriorate and enter the bloodstream, leading to kidney damage. A jury awarded Mr. Mimms $300,000 in damages.To prevent injuries, Reebok says its coaches at CrossFit One closely monitor all participants, who are also required to sign liability waivers. We are invested in taking care of you, its Web site reads.Clearly, CrossFit is not for everyone. A vast majority of employees at companies where its offered do not participate. And the cultish enthusiasm it inspires could make people with no interest in exercising feel excluded in the workplace.Tim Shea, 26, a data analyst at Datalogix, noted that watching dozens of his co-workers rolling around on a conference room floor can make you feel like you should be involved. But he has resisted, preferring to hike and to mountain-bike after work. I like some more adventure with my workouts, he said.Dr. Toni Yancey, a professor of health services at the University of California, Los Angeles, is all for people getting more exercise at work. But she says she thinks that incorporating movement into sedentary office routines makes more sense than pushing something like CrossFit, which is unlikely to engage a large portion of the average workplace. Dance breaks, walking to meetings together, sitting on balls  these things integrate physical movement into the daily routine, she said. And you dont have to shower afterward.The need to shower hasnt bothered the avid users at Reeboks centers, and other companies have taken notice. ESPN and the sports retailer Finish Line consulted Reebok in designing their own CrossFit boxes. In 2011, Mr. Glassman helped put a team of Microsoft senior engineers through a weekend-long Level 1 Certification course. There are now 40 CrossFit trainers inside Microsoft, he said, and theyre teaching other people how to do it.James Letchford, CrossFits chief marketing officer, said that a couple hundred companies in the United States and Europe offered classes and subsidized memberships for their staff.Perhaps the most ardent of these businesses is HGST, formerly Hitachi Global Storage Technologies, a seller of hard disk drives that was acquired by Western Digital in 2012. Mike Cordano, the president of HGST and an experienced CrossFitter, opened a fully staffed, employees-only CrossFit gym on each of its two campuses in San Jose, Calif., last October, in partnership with a local affiliate called NorCal CrossFit.Each of HGSTs new CrossFit affiliates pays a $3,000 annually renewable fee to use the CrossFit name, and Mr. Cordano plans to introduce the program at HGST offices in Minnesota and Colorado in April, then at sites in Asia this summer.CrossFits ability to foster camaraderie among co-workers  at least among those motivated to experiment with Olympic-style weight lifting  is especially suited to the life-swallowing rigors of start-up culture.A battle-hardened Green Beret once told me that CrossFit taught him the recipe for camaraderie, which is agony coupled with laughter, said Mr. Glassman, who is 56. He was talking about combat situations, but Id expect to hear the same from guys writing code.EMPLOYEES of Neverware, a small tech start-up company in Manhattan, agree that CrossFit reinforces workplace cooperation. When we were spotting each other on squats, we literally had each others backs, said Daniel Ryan, 22, a software developer and Princeton student who was an intern at the company last year.Until recently, the Neverware team worked out three times a week at CrossFit NYC. The workouts took place around 3 p.m.  the hour when employees had begun to nod off  and offered a much-needed interruption in 12- to 15-hour workdays. Jonathan Hefter, 27, the C.E.O., said he expected his staff members, then all men, to participate.For us, CrossFit was a major team-building exercise, he said. If someone didnt join in, it caused problems.But since January, Neverware, which builds servers that schools can use to make their dated computers run like new, has grown rapidly. Im also traveling more, and spending up to 10 hours a day in meetings, Mr. Hefter said. With the growing demand, the team cant afford to leave the office for two hours in the middle of the afternoon.While a few of Neverwares software engineers continue to go to CrossFit NYC, Mr. Hefter has moved to New York Sports Club, which better accommodates his chaotic new schedule. I definitely miss working out with the team, he said, a bit wistfully. But its not like we cant go back. Itd be a sign of a successful organization if our schedules became predictable enough to keep doing CrossFit together."
10,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/02/us/politics/republicans-refuel-effort-to-cripple-health-care-law.html,8/2/13,"WASHINGTON   With the House poised to vote Friday on yet another bill to cripple President Obamas health care law, the question arises: Why do Republicans persist in their so-far futile efforts?Democrats have many theories. Republicans, they suggest, care little about the uninsured. Many, they say, dislike Mr. Obama and want him to fail.The health care law has become the Republicans great white whale, Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California, said Thursday. They will stop at nothing to kill it.Republicans say they persist because the law is an example of government overreach and is proving unworkable. For many elected in the 2010 Republican wave, their opposition to the law is the reason they are in Congress. And, they say, voting to repeal the law is good politics, as it remains extremely unpopular among Republican voters.Republicans and some business owners also say they resent the way in which the law was written and passed by Democrats in 2009-10. Jeffrey S. Kelly, the chief executive of Hamill Manufacturing, a small Pennsylvania company that produces metal parts for Navy ships, made that point at a recent hearing to examine the effects of the law on businesses.Havent you really reaped what youve sown? Mr. Kelly asked House Democrats. Look at the history of this law. It was passed without any support on the Republican side.Though the White House and Congressional Democrats say they sought bipartisan support for the bill, Congressional Republicans argue that they were shut out of the legislative process.We offered 30 amendments when we were in the minority that were swatted away by the majority late into the night, not considered, not adopted, said Representative Peter Roskam, an Illinois Republican on the Ways and Means Committee.Representative Michael C. Burgess, Republican of Texas, said: No governor of either party was involved in the development of this law, even though the administration now says, We want the states to be involved and to be leaders in carrying it out.With the battle over health care still raging, some lawmakers say they now understand what Thomas Jefferson meant when he said, in 1808, that great innovations should not be forced on slender majorities, or enacted without broad support.When Congress created Social Security in 1935 and Medicare in 1965, the majorities in both chambers were larger and more bipartisan than the ones that passed the Affordable Care Act in 2010.The bill coming up in the House on Friday would prohibit enforcement of the health law by the Internal Revenue Service, the agency responsible for imposing penalties on individuals who go without insurance and on employers that fail to offer coverage.Representative Jim McDermott, Democrat of Washington, said one reason Republicans kept voting to repeal or gut the health care law was that they feared it would succeed.What we are hearing right now is the sound of Republican heart rates going up, Mr. McDermott said. Its a frenetic expression of Republican anxiety over the presidents signature legislation working. Washington, Oregon and California are already reporting lower rates for 2014. New York premiums were cut by 50 percent. Sick children are getting covered. The promise we made Americans is being fulfilled, and Republicans see a giant election map slowly losing red blocks.Republicans say that public opinion is on their side. In 2011-12, the House voted more than 30 times to roll back some or all of the law, but Speaker John A. Boehner said that more votes were needed this year because freshman Republicans wanted a chance to go on the record.Republicans were encouraged to see some Democrats voting with them last month. Twenty-two House Democrats joined them in voting to delay a crucial part of the law that requires most people to have insurance, and 35 voted to postpone a requirement that large employers offer coverage to full-time employees.Moreover, Republicans cite concerns about the law expressed by labor unions, including the Teamsters. In a letter last month to the top Democrats in Congress, James P. Hoffa, president of the Teamsters, and two other union presidents said that perverse incentives in the Affordable Care Act were already creating nightmare scenarios. They said that numerous employers have begun to cut workers hours to avoid the cost of providing them health benefits.Marilyn B. Tavenner, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, told Congress on Thursday that she had heard of only isolated incidents in which employers tried to cut back hours. Representative Steve Scalise, Republican of Louisiana, told her that she must be living in some cocoon because he heard of such actions almost every day.Votes to repeal the law are also a way to unite Republicans who cannot agree on other aspects of health policy.Republicans have never, never, never had a comprehensive health care reform plan, said Representative Sander M. Levin of Michigan, the senior Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee.Republicans are sparring among themselves over whether they should try to block all legislation that includes money to carry out the health care law. Some of the most conservative Republicans in Congress say they are prepared to force the issue in debate over a stopgap spending bill, needed to keep the government in operation beyond Sept. 30.Under no circumstances will we support a continuing resolution that funds one penny of Obamacare, said Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas.More experienced Republicans, including Senators John McCain of Arizona and Roy Blunt of Missouri, agree with the goal, but oppose the tactic, fearing that Republicans would be blamed for any government shutdown, as they were in 1995-96.Whatever the reasons for Republicans opposition to the law, it is unlikely that Fridays votes will be their last on the issue."
11,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/19/us/politics/house-gop-to-tie-spending-bill-to-health-law-defunding.html,9/19/13,"WASHINGTON   After three years of cajoling, finessing and occasionally strong-arming his fitful conservative majority, Speaker John A. Boehner waved the white flag on Wednesday, surrendering to demands from his right flank that he tie money to keep the government open after Sept. 30 to stripping President Obamas health care law of any financing.Mr. Boehner knows that the plan he unveiled cannot pass the Senate, and that it may prove unwise politically and economically. His leadership team pressed just last week for an alternative. But with conservative forces uniting against him, he ultimately saw no alternative but to capitulate  and few good options to stop a government shutdown in two weeks.Today was a step forward, and a win for the American people, said Representative Tom Graves, the Georgia Republican whose defund Obamacare push had amassed 80 House supporters, a bloc large enough to dictate the outcome.With much of the government set to run out of money at the end of the month  and run out of borrowing authority by mid-October  Mr. Boehner faced a choice: he could steer a middle ground and find a way out of his fiscal dead end with Republican and Democratic votes, or he could yield to a conservative movement to strip the Affordable Care Act of financing, unite his Republican majority around that war cry, and hope for the best.House conservatives let Mr. Boehner know that any solution that could not attract a majority of the Republican conference could cost him his speakership. Divided Senate Republicans made clear that linking further government spending or a debt ceiling increase to gutting the health care law would never get through the Senate.In March, the speaker himself said: Do you want to risk the full faith and credit of the U.S. government over Obamacare? Thats a very tough argument to make.On Wednesday, the speaker announced his choice.The laws a train wreck, he said. Its time to protect American families from this unworkable law.The Houses stopgap spending measure would finance the government through Dec. 15 at the current spending levels, which reflect the automatic spending cuts that took effect in March, known as sequestration, while blocking the health care law, under which the uninsured will be enrolled beginning on Oct. 1.If the bill clears the House on Friday, Republican leaders could put forward a measure as soon as next week that would raise the governments statutory borrowing limit. That bill would also take aim at the Affordable Care Act, with a one-year delay of its provisions coupled with a one-year increase in the debt ceiling. It would also expedite the construction of the Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada to Louisiana and set a timeline for an overhaul of the federal tax code, and possibly include some other Republican wishes, like specific spending cuts and regulatory changes.For Mr. Boehner, the announcement Wednesday was a humbling moment, and possibly a defining one. Since the Tea Party wave swept Republicans to power in 2010, the beleaguered speaker has often found himself at odds with the most conservative wing of his conference. In late 2011, he famously put his fractious conference on mute as he explained via telephone how it had to give up its opposition to extending a cut in the payroll tax.Three times this year, on major pieces of legislation, the speaker has put what he believed to be the greater needs of his country and his national party over those of his recalcitrant right wing. In January, the House passed legislation to avert huge and sudden tax increases on virtually every American  but let taxes rise on the wealthy  with Democratic votes and a minority of votes by Republicans. The same math passed relief for Hurricane Sandy and a reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act.This time around he was contrite, quoting a plaque that graced the speakers office of Newt Gingrich: Listen, Learn, Help and Lead.The key to any leadership job is to listen, Mr. Boehner said.Mr. Gingrich, of course, was deposed by an angry coup after Republicans lost seats in midterm elections during the second term of the last Democratic president, Bill Clinton. This time, the ground troops simply got their way with Mr. Boehner, providing new evidence that the Tea Party has changed Washington, not the other way around.As has been the case with each fiscal crisis since the Republicans took control of the House, Mr. Boehners decision was an embrace of short-term tactics over long-term strategy. How either the spending or the debt limit measures will become law is anybodys guess.Look, I think you could get all of us in the Senate to support it, Senator John Hoeven, Republican of North Dakota, said of his Senate Republican colleagues. The problem is, what is the Democrat majority going to do with it? Thats the challenge.Even the man who started the defund Obamacare boomlet, Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, seemed to accept Senate reality on Wednesday, putting the onus on House Republicans to stand and fight.Harry Reid will no doubt try to strip the defund language from the continuing resolution, and right now he likely has the votes to do so, Mr. Cruz said. At that point, House Republicans must stand firm.Mr. Obama was visibly irked by the speakers decision. You have never seen in the history of the United States the debt ceiling or the threat of not raising the debt ceiling being used to extort a president or a governing party, and trying to force issues that have nothing to do with the budget and have nothing to do with the debt, he said at the Business Roundtable, which represents the chief executives of the nations largest companies.Even the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a consistent ally of the Republican majority, questioned the Houses course.Democrats were gleeful at the potential political consequences. Representative Steve Israel of New York, the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said House Republicans set off Wednesday on a kamikaze mission, with their speaker in the pilots seat. Theyre living in right-wing fantasy land if they expect Democrats to take the blame for the chaos that could ensue, he said.But victorious House conservatives did their end-zone dance and evinced no worries about the final outcome.Even the best coaches in the N.F.L. only script out the first two series of plays, said Representative Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio, when asked how the speaker would play out the sequence of events. They dont script the whole game. Weve got to play the game. Weve got to see how it all shakes out."
12,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/10/us/politics/business-groups-urge-congress-to-reopen-as-shutdown-drags-on.html,10/10/13,"WASHINGTON   House Republicans, increasingly isolated from even some of their strongest supporters more than a week into a government shutdown, began on Wednesday to consider a path out of the fiscal impasse that would raise the debt ceiling for a few weeks as they press for a broader deficit reduction deal.That approach could possibly set aside the fight over the new health care law, which prompted the shutdown and which some Republicans will be reluctant to abandon.In a meeting with the most ardent House conservatives, Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, laid out a package focused on an overhaul of Medicare and a path toward a comprehensive simplification of the tax code.Were more in the ideas stage right now, said Representative Jack Kingston, Republican of Georgia and a senior member of the Appropriations Committee. There is a developing consensus that this is a lot bigger than an Obamacare discussion.At the same time, Congressional leaders from both parties began some preliminary discussions aimed at reopening the government and raising the statutory borrowing limit. And President Obama, who invited House Democrats on Wednesday, asked all House Republicans to the White House on Thursday, an invitation Speaker John A. Boehner whittled down to a short list of attendees he wants to negotiate a compromise.Democrats showed their own cracks. Twenty-six House Democrats planned to attend a bipartisan event on Thursday morning with the group No Labels, calling for negotiations to start immediately, a challenge to the president and to Democratic leaders who say they will not negotiate until the government reopens and the debt ceiling is lifted.In the meeting with House Democrats on Wednesday evening, Mr. Obama held firm to his stated intention to negotiate with Republicans only after the government is reopened and the debt ceiling is raised. He told Democrats that if he gives in now, Republican demands would be endless. The only thing not on their list is my own resignation, he told Democrats, according to a lawmaker in the room.With the impact of the shutdown starting to intensify, House Republicans were taking criticism from some of their longtime backers. Business groups demanded the immediate reopening of the government, and benefactors like Koch Industries publicly distanced themselves from the shutdown fight.Republicans acknowledged the pressure is mounting on them. On Wednesday, the National Retail Federation joined other reliably Republican business groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers in asking House Republicans to relent.We strongly support passage of both a continuing resolution to provide for funding of the federal government into the next fiscal year and a measure to raise the nations debt ceiling, the National Retail Federations president, Matthew Shay, said in a letter to Congress that pointed out economic indicators showing that the shutdown has already hurt consumer spending and depressed consumer confidence.In the meantime, Koch Industries accused Harry Reid, the Senate majority leader, on Wednesday of spreading false information about the company by suggesting it was behind the move to tie a demand to keep the government open only if financing was eliminated for Mr. Obamas health care law.Koch believes that Obamacare will increase deficits, lead to an overall lowering of the standard of health care and raise taxes, Philip Ellender, the companys chief spokesman, wrote in a letter to senators. However, Koch has not taken a position on the legislative tactic of tying the continuing resolution to defunding Obamacare, nor have we lobbied on legislative programs defunding Obamacare.Mr. Ryans meeting with the conservative Republican Study Committee seemed only to divide its ranks on the most critical issue: whether to set aside the fight over the presidents health care law and focus on long-term deficit reduction. The groups leader, Representative Steve Scalise, Republican of Louisiana, emerged still adamant that any way forward must include a hit to the Affordable Care Act, even if the package focused on entitlement programs  also called mandatory spending.Weve always talked about mandatory spending being addressed in a debt ceiling increase, but keep in mind Obamacare is part of mandatory spending, he said.Other conservatives showed a new flexibility. Representative Mo Brooks, Republican of Alabama and a fierce critic of the health care law, came out of the meeting and said: My primary focus is on minimizing risk of insolvency and bankruptcy. There are many paths you can take to get there.Socialized medicine is just one of the component parts of our debt and deficits that put us at financial risk. Are there paths that can be created that do not include socialized medicine? he asked. Yes.Members suggested they could get behind a lifting of the debt ceiling for several weeks to allow Republicans to unite around a deficit reduction and tax overhaul package.If we cannot get an agreement with the president at some point in time in the next few days, well look at something short term, said Mr. Scalise, echoing a suggestion Mr. Obama floated on Tuesday.But, the congressman said, even that should have spending cuts attached. He also said that a debt-ceiling increase of even three weeks should include a measure passed by the House denying federal subsidies to congressmen, White House officials and their staff members, who already must buy health insurance on the Affordable Care Acts new exchanges. And, he suggested, conservatives might insist on another House bill that would allow the Treasury to borrow enough money to pay off debts as they become due, taking away the threat of a government default.All of those measures would be stiffly resisted by Senate Democrats and the White House.Still, lawmakers did appear to be looking for a way forward after days of simply staring at one another. Ahead of the Wednesday meeting with House Democrats at the White House, Mr. Obama invited all House Republicans to a get-together on Thursday. Mr. Boehner saw a meeting between the president and 232 Republicans as a photo opportunity with no chance of producing substantive discussions. So he reduced the invitation list to 18. That will at least give the appearance of negotiations if it fails to prompt actual substantive talks.Finally, the White House has invited Congressional leaders to talk, Representative Harold Rogers, Republican of Kentucky, said in a statement. I am hopeful the president is serious about finding a deal that results in meaningful spending and entitlement reforms, judiciously extends U.S. government borrowing authority, reopens all federal agencies, and paves the way for the enactment of future appropriations bills so that this lurching from crisis to crisis can be put to an end."
13,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/16/us/politics/as-deadline-looms-boehner-herding-cats-in-bid-for-deal.html,10/16/13,"WASHINGTON   After House Republicans began their closed-door meeting on Tuesday with an impromptu rendition of Amazing Grace, Speaker John A. Boehner stood up with what he hoped would be an equally inspiring message.The Senate was trying to steamroll the House with a new plan to reopen the government and lift the debt ceiling, leaving his team with only two options: We can wait on the Senate for four days and accept whatever they give us, he told them. Or we can go on offense and force their hand.It was yet another moment of decision for Mr. Boehner, who finally finds himself at the crossroads he has been marching toward for weeks: an imminent financial default on the one hand, and on the other an unyielding conservative rank and file that persists with the futile effort to take down President Obamas health care law even if they also take down the speaker in the process.While his colleagues sang about how what once was lost had now been found, Mr. Boehner did not tell them a more dispiriting truth: With less than 48 hours left before the nation is set to exhaust its authority to borrow money, he and his lieutenants were running out ofideas  a fact made starkly evident by the mad and fruitless scramble on Tuesday to come up with ameasure that could win enough support from his members. Around 7 p.m., he sent the House home and canceled all votes for the day.Hes herding cats, said Representative Tom Price, Republican of Georgia.Mr. Boehner initially tried to unite his conference around a plan that had a little bit for everyone. For his hard-line conservative members, Mr. Boehners proposal would have eliminated government contributions for the purchase of health insurance on the new exchanges for lawmakers, White House officials and their staffs, as well as forbidden the Treasury Department to use extraordinary measures to extend its borrowing capabilities. For his more moderate members, Mr. Boehner offered a simple appeal  his plan would have reopened the government through Dec. 15, and extended the nations borrowing authority through Feb. 7.But conservatives and their advocacy groups balked, and Mr. Boehner was forced to set his plan aside.This is about as challenging as it can be, in terms of trying to figure out where the effective agreement is going to be to move forward and how do you get to that point where everybody looks at that and says, Well, that isnt everything but thats a reasonable way forward, said David Winston, a Republican strategist and close adviser to Mr. Boehner.Almost every day since the government shutdown began on Oct. 1, Mr. Boehner and his besieged band of House Republicans have trotted out a new gambit to try to outmaneuver Senate Democrats and the president. The public was upset over closed national monuments? Pass legislation reopening them. Vital health and safety services had no staff to carry out their functions? Appropriate money to finance them.All the while, Mr. Boehner, of Ohio, tended carefully to the members of his fractious conference. He joined them Friday night for P. F. Changs Chinese takeout in the Capitol. After an appearance on the Sunday talk shows, he shopped at his local Harris Teeter and invited some lawmakers to his Capitol Hill town house for burgers, manning the grill himself. He assumed the role of battlefield commander, admonishing the president in public in the sternest of terms.Mr. Boehner has also sought solace in his routines. He still takes long walks in the morning before heading to his office in the Capitol, and often eats breakfast alone at the counter of Petes Diner not far from his house. This month, shortly after the shutdown began, Mr. Boehner huddled in his Capitol suite with a group of allies and loyal members  Representatives Tom Cole of Oklahoma, John Kline of Minnesota and Pat Tiberi of Ohio, among others  known as Team Boehner.The strategy has largely worked, so far satisfying the most unmanageable of Mr. Boehners restive conservative members. But the next 48 hours may prove the biggest test of Mr. Boehners career and determine his future at the top of House Republicans. Its tough, said Senator Saxby Chambliss, the Georgia Republican who is one of the speakers closest friends in Congress. Trying to find 218 votes is never easy. But right now, its harder than ever.Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, who as a House member in the late 1990s was part of a successful coup to unseat Speaker Newt Gingrich, described Mr. Boehners tenuous state more bluntly, worrying aloud that if Mr. Boehner is unable to pass some proposal out of the House, the speaker may find himself in a compromised situation.I was involved in taking one speaker down, Mr. Graham said. Id like to be involved in keeping this speaker, because quite frankly I think he deserves it.A major source of Mr. Boehners limitations as speaker is simple math. Republicans control 232 seats, and 218 are required for a majority when there are no vacancies, meaning that in most instances, he can afford to lose only 14 Republican votes. For much of the 113th Congress, that has meant that the only bills guaranteed to pass are simple, nonpartisan matters like renaming a federal building or ones that strongly reflect conservative policies like the ban on abortion 20 weeks after fertilization.Because Mr. Boehner can almost never guarantee Senate leaders that his conference will vote with him, he has greatly diminished bargaining power in the current fight as his members pass one dead-end bill after another. Theres a silent majority in the conference, said Representative Devin Nunes, Republican of California. We have too many guys who dont understand that without 218 you have no leverage. At the end of the day, thats the problem.That has not stopped Mr. Boehner from trying. He has been in near constant contact with Republican leaders in the Senate, who have conveyed to Mr. Boehner what they believe their moderate Democratic counterparts might be willing to accept. He has also been carefully soliciting the views of his own members, bringing in at least two small groups of moderate legislators for private meetings, and buttonholing other colleagues on the House floor and in the cloakroom.He is a really good listener, said Representative James Lankford of Oklahoma, the chairman of the House Republican Policy Committee. So hes constantly trying to figure out, is this one person or is this a group that thinks this? And how large is that group? I just think he has a really unique skill of being able to hear people and where they are.Mr. Boehner may be unable to corral his maverick members, but they still rely on him heavily to bring in money for their re-elections: On Tuesday, in a telling reminder of his big-dollar prowess, Mr. Boehners campaign committee filed its third-quarter fund-raising report.Boehner-affiliated committees transferred $4.1 million to the National Republican Congressional Committee during the third quarter, making him its largest source of member money, by far."
14,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/26/us/politics/cruz-takes-his-stand-on-the-road-to-iowa.html,10/26/13,"DES MOINES   Senator Ted Cruz, the Texas Republican who has left senior members of his party worried about the political fallout from the federal government shutdown, argued here Friday that the battle over the health care law would invigorate Republicans in next years elections.For everyone who talks about wanting to win elections in 2014  particularly an off-year, nonpresidential year  nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing matters more than an energized and active and vocal grass-roots America, Mr. Cruz told about 600 Iowa Republicans at a party fund-raising dinner.The first-year senator, the face of the Congressional hard-liners who sought to link defunding the Affordable Care Act with financing the government, dismissed media attention on Republican infighting but said his party was not able to accomplish its goal during the budget fight because of internal divisions.We didnt because a significant number of Senate Republicans chose not to unite and stand side by side with House Republicans, said Mr. Cruz, drawing boos.The senator, making his third Iowa trip this year, made no direct mention of running for president in the state that begins the nominating process, but repeatedly mentioned Charles E. Grassley, the states Republican senator, and said they had worked together on gun legislation earlier this year.Repeatedly attacking official Washington in a 45-minute speech, Mr. Cruz jokingly asked what dumping every Washington strategist in the ocean would be called.A good start, he cracked.But the dinner here illustrated that the internal Republican strife was hardly limited to politicians and strategists in the nations capital. The Iowa state party has been taken over by the insurgent conservative wing, something made abundantly clear before Mr. Cruz took the stage.A number of state party officials began the dinner by criticizing the establishment wing of the party  or the old guard, as David Fischer, the Iowa Republican co-chairman, called it.Noting that some such mainline Republicans do not approve of the likes of Mr. Cruz and other young movement conservatives and even call them names, Mr. Fischer shot back: I have a name for these principled leaders, too: I call them the future.Another Iowa Republican official, the national committee member Steve Scheffler, asked in a prayer before the meal for more conservatives willing to be crucified for their belief system.Gov. Terry E. Branstad of Iowa, who comes from the establishment wing, offered strikingly different remarks: he fleetingly welcomed Mr. Cruz to the state and then hailed the efforts of Republican governors around the country, including some of Mr. Cruzs potential 2016 rivals."
15,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/01/opinion/are-liberals-fundraising-hypocrites.html,10/1/14,"Lets imagine that Republicans swept the 2012 elections and were now in control not merely of the House but of the presidency and the Senate, too.Now lets take it one step further and say that by using the filibuster the Democratic minority in the Senate had successfully blocked President Romneys appointments to federal district and appellate court judgeships.What if, faced with this Democratic intransigence, the conservative Federalist Society helped devise a strategy to revamp Senate rules to eliminate the filibuster so that judicial nominees could be confirmed by a simple majority instead of the 60 votes required to overcome a filibuster?The elimination of the filibuster has allowed President Romney to appoint three judges to the critically important United States Court of Appeals, District of Columbia Circuit, establishing a decisive 7 to 4 conservative majority on that bench. Whats more, two of the the three judges newly appointed by President Romney are members of the Federalist Society and the new conservative majority on the D.C. Circuit is now positioned to rule Obamacare unconstitutional.The Koch brothers  recall we are still in an alt-hypothetical universe  reward the Federalist Society by directing 100 loyal billionaires to contribute to the group.Would these developments provoke liberal outrage?They certainly would.But its not only the right that uses secretive organizations to keep rich donors anonymous while it seeks to influence elections and policy. Liberals do the same, and the press in large part gives them a pass.As you no doubt realized while you were reading, the hypothetical described above did not take place, but something approximating it did. Instead of Republican offenders, the players were President Obama, a Democratic Senate, the progressive American Constitution Society, and the Democracy Alliance, a network of very wealthy liberal donors.Heres what the Democratic Party and its allies actually did. The American Constitution Society  the left counterpart to the Federalist Society  helped lay the intellectual groundwork for Senate Democrats to put an end to filibusters of judicial nominees.The elimination of judicial filibusters in November 2013 allowed Democrats to approve, by simple majority, three of Obamas appointees to the United States Court of Appeals, D.C. Circuit, giving liberals a 7-4 majority.Because of the administrative law and national security cases it hears, the D.C. Circuit is considered the second most important court in the nation.The significance of the confirmation of three new Democratic appointees to the court became apparent in July, when a three-judge panel of the court ruled 2-1 in Halbig v. Burwell that residents of the 36 states that use the federal health care exchange were ineligible for subsidized insurance under Obamacare. The panels decision appeared to be a potentially crippling blow to the Affordable Care Act. The two judges in the majority on the panel were appointed by Republican presidents, the dissenter by a Democrat.On Sept. 4, however, the full Circuit Court of Appeals decided to set aside the three-judge panel decision and rehear the case en banc  that is, with all 11 judges, a majority of whom are now Democratic appointees.Has there been an outcry about Democratic court packing? Only in a right-wing online publication, the Washington Free Beacon, Democracy Alliance Bankrolled Court-Packing Scheme, and on the conservative website Breitbart.com, Exclusive - Leftist Money, Harry Reid Trying to Hijack Sanctity of the Independent Federal Judiciary. But the story does not end there. Conservatives claim that the Democracy Alliance is at the core of a liberal conspiracy.Mark Holden, general counsel at Koch Industries, contends that the Democracy Alliance orchestrates the activities of a permanent left infrastructure with ties to 172 organizations, each determined to attack the Koch brothers agenda of free enterprise and democratic capitalism.In a speech he gave to a closed meeting of conservative donors in Dana Point, Calif., on June 16, The Opposition: Understanding Their Strategy and Infrastructure, Holden, speaking about liberal organizations, argued thatThe Koch organization network is well known for its secretiveness. Holden suggested that their [Democracy Alliance] bottom line is not that different than ours, but in some ways theyre much better at it.A tape and transcript of Holdens speech were released by the left-leaning website Lady Libertine which, by its own account, seeks to unite the disenfranchised and resurrect the American Dream. Holden confirmed its veracity in an email to The Huffington Post.Despite Holdens argument that the liberal and conservative dark money networks are equivalent, there are substantial differences between them.The Democracy Alliance is an organization of roughly 100 very rich men and women who agree to contribute at least $200,000 annually to a list of roughly 20 liberal think tanks and advocacy groups, according to documents obtained by Politico. The Alliance itself makes no contributions. Nor does it pay for television ads or engage in other direct campaign activity.In effect, the Alliance helps guide an estimated $30 million a year. It does not disclose its members or the groups that are recipients of its members contributions, although a substantial amount of information has been gleaned by enterprising reporters.The projected total budgets of the endorsed organizations for 2014, according to the documents, are $189.2 million, of which the $30 million from Democracy Alliance partners would amount to nearly 15 percent.The Alliance does not claim tax-exempt status.In contrast, the Koch network is overwhelmingly made up of tax-exempt organizations claiming either 501(c)4 or 501(c)6 exempt status. Many of the Koch organizations spend money on political ads. The Center for Responsive Politics and the Washington Post estimated that in the 2011-12 election cycle, the Koch network of political, tax-exempt nonprofits raised at least $400 million.Gara LaMarche, the president of Democracy Alliance, defended his members, who have been accused of hypocrisy. The charge, coming from both the left and right, LaMarche wrote, centers on the assertion that progressive wealthy donors are spending a lot of money in elections when they also claim to be for getting money out of elections.LaMarche countered in an email thatIn contrast, political spending by the Kochs and their alliesDavid Brock, the chairman of Media Matters, which is one of the groups endorsed by the Alliance, made a similar argument at a Democracy Alliance meeting in Santa Fe in June:Brock and LaMarches argument is politically risky. Claiming the moral high ground to assert that you can do something that your morally crippled adversaries cannot is one of the more effective strategies to alienate people.Liberals are not alone in the gravity of their claims. Officials of Koch Industries contend there have been death threats against the Kochs and threats against our facilities. They like to cite a 1958 Supreme Court decision, N.A.A.C.P. v. Alabama, in which the court unanimously backed the N.A.A.C.P.s refusal to turn over its membership list to the Alabama Attorney General on the basis that release of the names would put the lives of N.A.A.C.P. members in danger.The leadership of the Democracy Alliance is now queasy about its policies on anonymous donations. The Koch organizations remain adamant in their refusal to disclose donors.In a series of emails and phone conversations, LaMarche said that he is pressing members of the Alliance to be more open. He would like, for example, to list the names of those willing to give up their privacy. He also said that he expects the Alliance to adopt a policy of releasing the names of the organizations to which it recommends its members make contributions.The more transparent we can be, the better. Progressive values are much more in line with transparency, LaMarche said during our conversation.Koch officials declined to answer my question, Is transparency a good thing in democratic politics?Political spending by dark money groups that do not disclose donors is on track to break all previous records. By some calculations, such spending accounts for more than half the media outlay by outside organizations in current House and Senate races.Robert Maguire, who set up the Politically Active Nonprofits Project at the Center for Responsive Politics, reported on Sept. 4 that dark money organizations have already dropped $68 million on air time alone in Senate and House races, making up 56 percent of all the spending by independent expenditure groups.Publications like Mother Jones are warning that the 2014 elections will be the start of a Dark-Money Apocalypse. If recent Supreme Court rulings stand and the Federal Election Commission continue to refuse to regulate political groups that do not disclose contributors, dark money spending will at some point in the not-too-distant future become the single most important source of election cash in the key battleground contests that determine which party controls the House and Senate. This is already the case for some Republican candidates in tight contests.In the North Carolina Senate race, for example, Thom Tillis, the Republican challenger, has so far spent $3.23 million. Conservative dark money groups have invested twice that, $6.7 million, in his candidacy. Kay Hagen, the incumbent Democrat, has raised $7.96 million, and liberal dark money groups have spent $2.1 million.The Center for Responsive Politics has demonstrated that in the top eight 2014 Senate races, dark money tilts decisively to the right: $28 million spent by conservative groups, $12.3 million by liberal organizations.In the long run, the relatively modest (but growing) dependence of Democrats on dark money, mega-dollar contributors to super PACs and other funding mechanisms is corrupting, even as it comes alongside the partys parallel success in building a powerful small donor base. On issues of taxes, regulation, spending and campaign finance, the Republican Party has established itself as the advocate of the wealthiest Americans. Insofar as the Democratic Party moves in the same direction, it will be unable to act as a counterbalance to the right.While neither the left nor the right has clean hands, liberals have far more to lose, and much less to gain, from continued hypocrisy."

Thank you. Thank you so much, please. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of Congress, my fellow Americans.We are 15 years into this new century, 15 years that dawned with terror touching our shores; that unfolded with a new generation fighting two long and costly wars; that saw a vicious recession spread across our nation and the world. It has been, and still is, a hard time for many. But tonight, we turn the page.Tonight, after a breakthrough year for America, our economy is growing and creating jobs at the fastest pace since 1999. (Applause.) Our unemployment rate is now lower than it was before the financial crisis. More of our kids are graduating than ever before; more of our people are insured than ever before  (applause)  and we are as free from the grip of foreign oil as weve been in almost 30 years. (Applause.)Tonight, for the first time since 9/11, our combat mission in Afghanistan is over. Six years ago, nearly 180,000 American troops served in Iraq and Afghanistan. Today, fewer than 15,000 remain. And we salute the courage and sacrifice of every man and woman in this 9/11 Generation who has served to keep us safe. We are humbled and grateful for your service. (Applause.)America, for all that weve endured, for all the grit and hard work required to come back, for all the tasks that lie ahead, know this: The shadow of crisis has passed, and the State of the Union is strong. (Applause.)At this moment, with a growing economy, shrinking deficits, bustling industry, booming energy production, we have risen from recession freer to write our own future than any other nation on Earth. Its now up to us to choose who we want to be over the next 15 years, and for decades to come.Will we accept an economy where only a few of us do spectacularly well? Or will we commit ourselves to an economy that generates rising incomes and chances for everyone who makes the effort? (Applause.)Will we approach the world fearful and reactive, dragged into costly conflicts that strain our military and set back our standing? Or will we lead wisely, using all elements of our power to defeat new threats and protect our planet?Will we allow ourselves to be sorted into factions and turned against one another, or will we recapture the sense of common purpose that has always propelled America forward?In two weeks, I will send this Congress a budget filled with ideas that are practical, not partisan. And in the months ahead, Ill crisscross the country making a case for those ideas.So tonight, I want to focus less on a checklist of proposals, and focus more on the values at stake in the choices before us.It begins with our economy.Seven years ago, Rebekah and Ben Erler of Minneapolis were newlyweds.

They were young and in love in America, and it doesnt get much better than that.If only we had known, Rebekah wrote to me last spring, what was about to happen to the housing and construction market.As the crisis worsened, Bens business dried up, so he took what jobs he could find, even if they kept him on the road for long stretches of time.Rebekah took out student loans and enrolled in community college and retrained for a new career.They sacrificed for each other, and slowly, it paid off. They bought their first home. They had a second son, Henry. Rebekah got a better job, and then a raise. Bens back in construction and home for dinner every night.It is amazing, Rebekah wrote, what you can bounce back from when you have to. We are a strong, tight-knit family who has made it through some very, hard times.We are a strong, tight-knit family who has made it through some very, hard times.America, Rebekah and Bens story is our story. They represent the millions whove worked hard and scrimped and sacrificed and retooled.You are the reason that I ran for this office. You are the people I was thinking of six years ago today in the darkest months of the crisis when I stood on the steps of this Capitol and promised we would rebuild our economy on a new foundation. And it has been your resilience, your effort that has made it possible for our country to emerge stronger.We believed we could reverse the tide of outsourcing, and draw new jobs to our shores. And over the past five years, our businesses have created more than 11 million new jobs. (Applause.)We believed we could reduce our dependence on foreign oil and protect our planet. And today, America is number one in oil and gas. America is number one in wind power. Every three weeks, we bring online as much solar power as we did in all of 2008. (Applause.)And thanks to lower gas prices and higher fuel standards, the typical family this year should save about $750 at the pump. (Applause.)We believed we could prepare our kids for a more competitive world. And today, our younger students have earned the highest math and reading scores on record. Our high school graduation rate has hit an all-time high. More Americans finish college than ever before. (Applause.We believed that sensible regulations could prevent another crisis, shield families from ruin, and encourage fair competition.Today, we have new tools to stop taxpayer-funded bailouts, and a new consumer watchdog to protect us from predatory lending and abusive credit card practices. And in the past year alone, about ten million uninsured Americans finally gained the security of health coverage. (Applause.)At every step, we were told our goals were misguided or too ambitious, that we would crush jobs and explode deficits. Instead, weve seen the fastest economic growth in over a decade, our deficits cut by two thirds, a stock market that has doubled and health care inflation at its lowest rate in 50 years. (Applause.)This is good news, people. (Laughter.) So  (applause) -- so the verdict is clear. Middle-class economics works, expanding opportunity works, and these policies will continue to work as long as politics dont get in the way.We cant slow down businesses or put our economy at risk with government shutdowns or fiscal showdowns. We cant put the security of families at risk by taking away their health insurance or unraveling the new rules on Wall Street or refighting past battles on immigration when weve got to fix a broken system.And if a bill comes to my desk that tries to do any of these things, it will veto it. It will have earned my veto. (Applause.)Today, thanks to a growing economy, the recovery is touching more and more lives. Wages are finally starting to rise again. We know that more small-business owners plan to raise their employees pay than at any time since 2007.But heres the thing. Those of us here tonight, we need to set our sights higher than just making sure government doesnt screw things up, the government doesnt halt the progress were making. We need to do more than just do no harm.Tonight, together, lets do more to restore the link between hard work and growing opportunity for every American. (Applause.)Because families like Rebekahs still need our help. She and Ben are working as hard as ever, but theyve had to forego vacations and a new car so that they can pay off student loans and save for retirement. Friday night pizza, thats a big splurge. Basic child care for Jack and Henry costs more than their mortgage, and almost as much as a year at the University of Minnesota.Like millions of hardworking Americans, Rebekah isnt asking for a handout, but she is asking that we look for more ways to help families get ahead.And in fact, at every moment of economic change throughout our history, this country has taken bold action to adapt to new circumstances and to make sure everyone gets a fair shot.We set up worker protections, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid to protect ourselves from the harshest adversity. We gave our citizens schools and colleges, infrastructure and the Internet, tools they needed to go as far as their efforts and their dreams will take them.Thats what middle-class economics is: the idea that this country does best when everyone gets their fair shot, everyone does their fair share, everyone plays by the same set of rules. (Applause.) We dont just want everyone to share in Americas success; we want everyone to contribute to our success. (Applause.)So -- so what does middle-class economics require in our time?First, middle-class economics means helping working families feel more secure in a world of constant change. That means helping folks afford child care, college, health care, a home, retirement, and my budget will address each of these issues, lowering the taxes of working families and putting thousands of dollars back into their pockets each year. (Applause.)Heres one example: During World War II, when men like my grandfather went off to war, having women like my grandmother in the work force was a national security priority. So this country provided universal child care.In todays economy, when having both parents in the work force is an economic necessity for many families, we need affordable, high-quality child care more than ever. (Applause.)Its not a nice-to-have: its a must-have. So its time we stop treating child care as a side issue, or a womens issue, and treat it like the national economic priority that it is for all of us. (Applause.)And thats why my plan will make quality child care more available, and more affordable, for every middle-class and low-income family with young children in America, by creating more slots and a new tax cut of up to $3,000 per child, per year. (Applause.)Heres another example. Today, we are the only advanced country on Earth that doesnt guarantee paid sick leave or paid maternity leave to our workers. 43 million workers have no paid sick leave. 43 million. Think about that.And that forces too many parents to make the gut-wrenching choice between a paycheck and a sick kid at home. So Ill be taking new action to help states adopt paid leave laws of their own. And since paid sick leave won where it was on the ballot last November, lets put it to a vote right here in Washington. (Applause.) Send me a bill that gives every worker in America the opportunity to earn seven days of paid sick leave.Its the right thing to do. (Applause.)Of course, nothing helps families make ends meet like higher wages. Thats why this Congress still needs to pass a law that makes sure a woman is paid the same as a man for doing the same work. (Applause.) Its 2015. Its time. We still need to make sure employees get the overtime theyve earned -- (applause) -- and everyone in this Congress who still refuses to raise the minimum wage, I say this: If you truly believe you could work full-time and support a family on less than $15,000 a year, try it. (Laughter.) If not, vote to give millions of the hardest-working people in America a raise. (Applause.)These ideas wont make everybody rich, wont relieve every hardship. Thats not the job of government.To give working families a fair shot, we still need more employers to see beyond next quarters earnings and recognize that investing in their work force is in their companys long-term interest.We still need laws that strengthen rather than weaken unions, and give American workers a voice. (Applause.)But -- but you know, things like child care and sick leave and equal pay, things like lower mortgage premiums and a higher minimum wage, these ideas will make a meaningful difference in the lives of millions of families. Thats a fact. And thats what all of us, Republicans and Democrats alike, were sent here to do.Second, to make sure folks keep earning higher wages down the road, we have to do more to help Americans upgrade their skills. (Applause.)Now America thrived in the 20th century because we made high school free, sent a generation of G.I.s to college, trained the best work force in the world. We were ahead of the curve. But other countries caught on. And in a 21st century economy that rewards knowledge like never before, we need to up our game. We need to do more.By the end of this decade, two in three job openings will require some higher education. Two in three. And yet, we still live in a country where too many bright, striving Americans are priced out of the education they need. Its not fair to them, and its sure not smart for our future. Thats why I am sending this Congress a bold new plan to lower the cost of community college to zero. (Applause.)Keep in mind, 40 percent of our college students choose community college. Some are young and starting out. Some are older and looking for a better job. Some are veterans and single parents trying to transition back into the job market.Whoever you are, this plan is your chance to graduate ready for the new economy, without a load of debt. Understand, youve got to earn it. Youve got to keep your grades up and graduate on time.Tennessee, a state with Republican leadership, and Chicago, a city with Democratic leadership, are showing that free community college is possible. I want to spread that idea all across America so that two years of college becomes as free and universal in America as high school is today. (Applause.) Lets stay ahead of the curve.And -- and I want to work with this Congress to make sure Americans already burdened with student loans can reduce their monthly payments so that student debt doesnt derail anyones dreams. (Applause.)Thanks to Vice President Bidens great work to update our job training system, were connecting community colleges with local employers to train workers to fill high-paying jobs like coding and nursing and robotics.Tonight, Im also asking more businesses to follow the lead of companies like CVS and UPS and offer more educational benefits and paid apprenticeships, opportunities that give workers the chance to earn higher-paying jobs, even if they dont have a higher education.And as a new generation of veterans comes home, we owe them every opportunity to live the American Dream they helped defend.Already, weve made strides towards ensuring that every veteran has access to the highest quality care, were slashing the backlog that had too many veterans waiting years to get the benefits they need, and were making it easier for vets to translate their training and experience into civilian jobs.And joining forces, the national campaign launched by Michelle and Jill Biden -- (applause) -- thank you, Michelle, thank you, Jill -- has helped nearly 700,000 veterans and military spouses get a new job. (Applause.)So to every C.E.O. in America, let me repeat: If you want somebody whos going to get the job done, and done right, hire a veteran. (Applause.)Finally, as we better train our workers, we need the new economy to keep churning out high-wage jobs for our workers to fill. Since 2010, America has put more people back to work than Europe, Japan, and all advanced economies combined. (Applause.)Our manufacturers have added almost 800,000 new jobs. Some of our bedrock sectors, like our auto industry, are booming. But there are also millions of Americans who work in jobs that didnt even exist 10 or 20 years ago: jobs at companies like Google, and eBay, and Tesla.So no one knows for certain which industries will generate the jobs of the future. But we do know we want them here in America. (Applause.) We know that.Thats why the third part of middle-class economics is all about building the most competitive economy anywhere, the place where businesses want to locate and hire.Twenty-first-century businesses need 21st-century infrastructure: modern ports, and stronger bridges, faster trains and the fastest Internet. (Applause.)Democrats and Republicans used to agree on this. So lets set our sights higher than a single oil pipeline; lets pass a bipartisan -- (applause) -- infrastructure plan that could create more than 30 times as many jobs per year and make this country stronger for decades to come.Lets do it. Lets get it done. (Applause.) Lets get it done.Twenty-first-century businesses, including small businesses, need to sell more American products overseas. Today, our businesses export more than ever, and exporters tend to pay their workers higher wages.But as we speak, China wants to write the rules for the worlds fastest-growing region. That would put our workers and our businesses at a disadvantage.Why would we let that happen? We should write those rules. We should level the playing field.Thats why Im asking both parties to give me trade promotion authority to protect American workers with strong new trade deals from Asia to Europe -- (applause) -- that arent just free but are also fair. Its the right thing to do.Look, Im -- Im the first one to admit -- Im the first one to admit that past trade deals havent always lived up to the hype, and thats why weve gone after countries  (applause) -- that break the rules at our expense. But 95 percent of the worlds customers live outside our borders. We cant close ourselves off from those opportunities. More than half of manufacturing executives have said theyre actively looking to bring jobs back from China. So lets give them one more reason to get it done.Twenty-first-century businesses will rely on American science and technology, research and development. I want the country that eliminated polio and mapped the human genome to lead a new era of medicine: one that delivers the right treatment at the right time. (Applause.)In some patients with cystic fibrosis, this approach has reversed a disease once thought unstoppable. Tonight, Im launching a new Precision Medicine Initiative to bring us closer to curing diseases like cancer and diabetes and to give all of us access to the personalized information we need to keep ourselves and our families healthier. We can do this. (Applause.)I intend to protect a free and open Internet, to extend its reach to every classroom, and every community -- (applause) -- and help folks build the fastest networks, so that the next generation of digital innovators and entrepreneurs have the platform to keep reshaping our world.I want Americans to win the race for the kinds of discoveries that unleash new jobs: converting sunlight into liquid fuel; creating revolutionary prosthetics, so that a veteran who gave his arms for his country can play catch with his kids again. (Applause.)Pushing out into the solar system not just to visit, but to stay. Last month, we launched a new spacecraft as part of a re-energized space program that will send American astronauts to Mars. And in two months, to prepare us for those missions, Scott Kelly will begin a yearlong stay in space. So good luck, Captain. (Applause.) Make sure to Instagram it. Were proud of you.Now, the truth is when it comes to issues like infrastructure and basic research, I know theres bipartisan support in this chamber. Members of both parties have told me so.Where we too often run onto the rocks is how to pay for these investments. As Americans, we dont mind paying our fair share of taxes, as long as everybody else does too.But for far too long, lobbyists have rigged the tax code with loopholes that let some corporations pay nothing while others pay full freight. Theyve riddled it with giveaways that the super rich dont need, while denying a break to middle-class families who do.This year, we have an opportunity to change that. Lets close loopholes so we stop rewarding companies that keep profits abroad, and reward those that invest in America. (Applause.) Lets use those savings to rebuild our infrastructure and make it more attractive for companies to bring jobs home. Lets simplify the system and let a small-business owner file based on her actual bank statement instead of the number of accountants she can afford. (Applause.)And lets close the loopholes that lead to inequality by allowing the top one percent to avoid paying taxes on their accumulated wealth. We can use that money to help more families pay for child care and send their kids to college. We need a tax code that truly helps working Americans trying to get a leg up in the new economy, and we can achieve that together. (Applause.) We can achieve it together.Helping hardworking families make ends meet. Giving them the tools they need for good-paying jobs in this new economy. Maintaining the conditions of growth and competitiveness. This is where America needs to go. I believe its where the American people want to go. It will make our economy stronger a year from now, 15 years from now, and deep into the century ahead.Of course, if theres one thing this new century has taught us, its that we cannot separate our work at home from challenges beyond our shores.My first duty as Commander-in-Chief is to defend the United States of America. In doing so, the question is not -- in doing so the question is not whether America leads in the world, but how.When we make rash decisions, reacting to the headlines instead of using our heads; when the first response to a challenge is to send in our military, then we risk getting drawn into unnecessary conflicts, and neglect the broader strategy we need for a safer, more prosperous world. Thats what our enemies want us to do.I believe in a smarter kind of American leadership. We lead best when we combine military power with strong diplomacy; when we leverage our power with coalition building; when we dont let our fears blind us to the opportunities that this new century presents.Thats exactly what were doing right now, and around the globe, it is making a difference.First, we stand united with people around the world whove been targeted by terrorists, from a school in Pakistan to the streets of Paris.We will continue  (applause) -- to hunt down terrorists and dismantle their networks, and we reserve the right to act unilaterally, as we have done relentlessly since I took office, to take out terrorists who pose a direct threat to us and our allies. (Applause.)At the same time, weve learned some costly lessons over the last 13 years. Instead of Americans patrolling the valleys of Afghanistan, weve trained their security forces, whove now taken the lead, and weve honored our troops sacrifice by supporting that countrys first democratic transition.Instead of sending large ground forces overseas, were partnering with nations from South Asia to North Africa to deny safe haven to terrorists who threaten America.In Iraq and Syria, American leadership, including our military power, is stopping ISILs advance. Instead of getting dragged into another ground war in the Middle East, we are leading a broad coalition, including Arab nations, to degrade and ultimately destroy this terrorist group. (Applause.)Were also supporting a moderate opposition in Syria that can help us in this effort and assisting people everywhere who stand up to the bankrupt ideology of violent extremism.Now, this effort will take time. It will require focus. But we will succeed. And tonight, I call on this Congress to show the world that we are united in this mission by passing a resolution to authorize the use of force against ISIL. (Applause.) We need that authority.Second, we are demonstrating the power of American strength and diplomacy. Were upholding the principle that bigger nations cant bully the small by opposing Russian aggression and supporting Ukraines democracy, and reassuring our NATO allies. (Applause.)Last year, as we were doing the hard work of imposing sanctions along with our allies, as we were reinforcing our presence with the frontline states, Mr. Putins aggression, it was suggested, was a masterful display of strategy and strength. Thats what I heard from some folks. Well, today, it is America that stands strong and united with our allies, while Russia is isolated, with its economy in tatters. Thats how America leads: not with bluster, but with persistent, steady resolve. (Applause.)In Cuba, we are ending a policy  (applause) -- that was long past its expiration date. When what youre doing doesnt work for 50 years, its time to try something new. (Applause.) And our shift in Cuba policy has the potential to end a legacy of mistrust in our hemisphere and removes the phony excuse for restrictions in Cuba, stands up for democratic values and extends the hand of friendship to the Cuban people. And this year, Congress should begin the work of ending the embargo. (Applause.)As -- as His Holiness, Pope Francis, has said, diplomacy is the work of small steps. These small steps have added up to new hope for the future in Cuba. And after years in prison, we are overjoyed that Alan Gross is back where he belongs. (Applause.) Welcome home, Alan. Were glad youre here.Our diplomacy is at work with respect to Iran, where, for the first time in a decade, weve halted the progress of its nuclear program and reduced its stockpile of nuclear material.Between now and this spring, we have a chance to negotiate a comprehensive agreement that prevents a nuclear-armed Iran, secures America and our allies, including Israel, while avoiding yet another Middle East conflict.Therere no guarantees that negotiations will succeed, and I keep all options on the table to prevent a nuclear Iran. But new sanctions passed by this Congress at this moment in time will all but guarantee that diplomacy fails, alienating America from its allies, making it harder to maintain sanctions and ensuring that Iran starts up its nuclear program again. It doesnt make sense. That is why I will veto any new sanctions bill that threatens to undo this progress. (Applause.) The American people expect us to only go to war as a last resort, and I intend to stay true to that wisdom.Third, were looking beyond the issues that have consumed us in the past to shape the coming century.No foreign nation, no hacker, should be able to shut down our networks, steal our trade secrets, or invade the privacy of American families, especially our kids. (Applause.)But we are making sure our government integrates intelligence to combat cyber threats, just as we have done to combat terrorism. And tonight, I urge this Congress to finally pass the legislation we need to better meet the evolving threat of cyberattacks, combat identity theft, and protect our childrens information. That should be a bipartisan effort. (Applause.)You know, if we dont act, well leave our nation and our economy vulnerable. If we do, we can continue to protect the technologies that have unleashed untold opportunities for people around the globe.In West Africa, our troops, our scientists, our doctors, our nurses and health care workers are rolling back Ebola, saving countless lives and stopping the spread of disease. (Applause.) I could not be prouder of them, and I thank this Congress for your bipartisan support of their efforts.But the job is not yet done, and the world needs to use this lesson to build a more effective global effort to prevent the spread of future pandemics, invest in smart development and eradicate extreme poverty.In the Asia Pacific, we are modernizing alliances while making sure that other nations play by the rules in how they trade, how they resolve maritime disputes, how they participate in meeting common international challenges like nonproliferation and disaster relief. And no challenge, no challenge, poses a greater threat to future generations than climate change. (Applause.) 2014 was the planets warmest year on record.Now, one year doesnt make a trend, but this does: 14 of the 15 warmest years on record have all fallen in the first 15 years of this century.Ive heard some folks try to dodge the evidence by saying theyre not scientists, that we dont have enough information to act. Well, Im not a scientist either. But you know what? I know a lot of really good scientists at NASA and at NOAA and at our major universities, and the best scientists in the world are all telling us that our activities are changing the climate, and if we dont act forcefully, well continue to see rising oceans, longer, hotter heat waves, dangerous droughts and floods, and massive disruptions that can trigger greater migration and conflict and hunger around the globe. The Pentagon says that climate change poses immediate risks to our national security. We should act like it. (Applause.)Thats why, over the past six years, weve done more than ever to combat climate change, from the way we produce energy, to the way we use it. Thats why weve set aside more public lands and waters than any administration in history. And thats why I will not let this Congress endanger the health of our children by turning back the clock on our efforts. I am determined to make sure American leadership drives international action. (Applause.)In Beijing, we made a historic announcement: the United States will double the pace at which we cut carbon pollution, and China committed, for the first time, to limiting their emissions. And because the worlds two largest economies came together, other nations are now stepping up, and offering hope that, this year, the world will finally reach an agreement to protect the one planet weve got.And Theres one last pillar of our leadership, and thats the example of our values.As Americans, we respect human dignity, even when were threatened, which is why Ive prohibited torture, and worked to make sure our use of new technology like drones is properly constrained. (Applause.) Its why we speak out against the deplorable anti-Semitism that has resurfaced in certain parts of the world. (Applause.)Its why we continue to reject offensive stereotypes of Muslims, the vast majority of whom share our commitment to peace. Thats why we defend free speech and advocate for political prisoners and condemn the persecution of women or religious minorities or people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender. We do these things not only because they are the right thing to do -- (applause) -- but because ultimately, they make us safer.As Americans, we have a profound commitment to justice. So it makes no sense to spend $3 million per prisoner to keep open a prison that the world condemns and terrorists use to recruit. (Applause.)Since Ive been president, weve worked responsibly to cut the population of Gitmo in half. Now it is time to finish the job, and I will not relent in my determination to shut it down. It is not who we are. (Applause.) Its time to close Gitmo.As Americans, we cherish our civil liberties, and we need to uphold that commitment if we want maximum cooperation from other countries and industry in our fight against terrorist networks. So while some have moved on from the debates over our surveillance programs, I have not. As promised, our intelligence agencies have worked hard, with the recommendations of privacy advocates to increase transparency and build more safeguards against potential abuse.And next month, well issue a report on how were keeping our promise to keep our country safe while strengthening privacy.Looking to the future instead of the past, making sure we match our power with diplomacy and use force wisely. Building coalitions to meet new challenges and opportunities. Leading always with the example of our values. Thats what makes us exceptional. Thats what keeps us strong. And thats why we have to keep striving to hold ourselves to the highest of standards: our own.You know, just over a decade ago, I gave a speech in Boston where I said there wasnt a liberal America, or a conservative America; a black America or a white America, but a United State"
17,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/14/us/politics/from-cybersecurity-to-trade-deal-bills-are-expected-to-start-moving-in-congress.html,4/14/15,"WASHINGTON   After a lengthy stretch of legislative somnolence, interrupted occasionally by frenetic action to prevent the government from shutting down, Congress is now pivoting to policy.Over the next several weeks, lawmakers are expected to consider a sweeping trade measure championed by President Obama, a bill that makes significant changes to the Medicare program and the reauthorization of programs for national security and education. They also will take up bills to address cybersecurity, to finance the nations transportation system and to outline budget priorities.On top of that, Congress is enmeshed in a debate over presidential powers as it considers legislation that could scuttle Mr. Obamas proposed framework for a nuclear accord with Iran.Republicans will reach their 100th day in control of Congress on Thursday, and the start has been far slower than promised by Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, who knows that his party needs legislative victories ahead of the 2016 elections.Mr. McConnell was stymied by a long fight over funding the Department of Homeland Security and the protracted consideration of approval for the Keystone XL oil pipeline, which ended in a predictable presidential veto.But for Mr. McConnell and other Republicans, the recent humming of legislation means that committees are doing their jobs, at least for now.What were seeing is a restoration of the Senate, Mr. McConnell said Monday in an email. Committees are working productively in a way we havent seen in years, which allows us to bring bipartisan bills to the Senate floor that can be amended and passed and hopefully sent to the president to become law.The challenge for Mr. McConnell will be to continue momentum while working with a slim majority and hostile Democrats schooled in his techniques of blocking legislation when Republicans were in the minority. There is also the inconvenient fact that three of Mr. McConnells members  Ted Cruz of Texas, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Marco Rubio of Florida  are now running for president, each potentially attempting to outflank the others with a voting record that would seem appealing in the Republican primaries.They sort of wasted the first three months on Keystone and D.H.S. fights, said Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, the third-ranking Democrat. And now a whole lot of things have piled up. And we now have three presidential candidates, and they may pull others to the right. McConnell knows for the good of his party that getting things done are important. He promised it during his campaign, but I think the politics of his party tie him in a knot.Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, said on the floor on Monday: We all remember the lofty promises made by the Republican leader and his party before they assumed power. But yet, here we are still struggling to finish two issues that should have been resolved weeks ago.Interestingly, the two highest-profile issues  trade and cybersecurity  unite the Obama administration with Republicans more than with Democrats.After months of haggling, the Senate and the House are expected to release a hard-fought proposal this week to grant the president ""fast-track"" authority on a trade agreement.The legislation  strongly opposed by many congressional Democrats  would allow the Obama administration to complete negotiations on the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership, the largest trade accord in a generation, knowing that Congress could approve or reject it but not amend it. The bill would apply certain conditions to the trade agreement.After the bills announcement, likely on Wednesday, the Finance Committee would move quickly to complete it and send it to the full Senate, setting up a major showdown in the House. Mr. Obama and the House Republican leadership would be aligned against most House Democrats, who say the bill would harm American jobs, and against the most conservative Republicans, who dislike extending such authority to Mr. Obama.Over the next several weeks, both chambers are expected to consider a major cybersecurity bill designed to encourage private companies to share data with each other, the Department of Homeland Security and, through the department, ultimately the nations intelligence agencies. But past efforts have faltered on the issue of liability protection for the firms. Such legislation is desired by the White House, which views information sharing by private industry as critical to detecting and deterring threats.The Senate is also expected to pass a bill, which was overwhelmingly approved in the House last month, that would establish a new formula for paying doctors in the Medicare program and expand a childrens health program. Such movement is good news for all of our constituents, Democrat or Republican, Mr. McConnell said, and its something well continue to build upon.Movement on various issues had stalled before a two-week congressional recess, which ended on Monday, because Republicans and Democrats got into a tussle over abortion provisions in a bill to combat human trafficking.The bill, sponsored by Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, would create a fund for victims based on fees assessed to the people who bought or sold them. The bill also would have prevented that money from being used to pay for abortions for the victims, an application of the Hyde Amendment, which generally prohibits taxpayer funds from being used for abortions. Many Democrats opposed the measure, which they see as an expansion of abortion restrictions.The issue continues to hold up the confirmation vote of Mr. Obamas nominee for attorney general, Loretta E. Lynch, because Mr. McConnell said the chamber would not vote on her until the trafficking bill moves off the floor. The Senate has been extremely slow to confirm other judicial nominees. On Monday, it confirmed its first of this year  Judge Alfred H. Bennett to the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas  compared with 18 circuit and district court judges approved during the same period last year."
18,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/27/opinion/sunday/to-unite-the-earth-connect-it.html,9/27/15,"SEVENTY years ago, the United Nations was formed as the expression of a simple choice: cooperation instead of war. Humanity would stand as one against conflict, poverty and disease. All the worlds voices would be heard.At least, that was the plan.Weve come a long way. Weve halted and reversed the spread of killer diseases, extended life expectancy and raised incomes. Weve even walked ourselves back from the edge of some global conflicts and catastrophes. But progress has not been evenly distributed. Too many people have been left outside of a mostly urban, mostly Northern success story.Seeing that, world leaders put forth a new set of global goals in New York last week. If we want to build a world where not just some but all get to live in security and prosperity, theres a lot still to do, as the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development signed off on by United Nations member states shows.It lists 17 goals and 169 targets, and one of these, 9(c), is a target that we believe is crucial to accelerate realization of all the others: a commitment to provide Internet connectivity for all by 2020.Today over half the people on this planet dont have access. That is not good for anyone  not for the disempowered and disconnected, and not for the other half, whose commerce and security depend on having stable societies.An unprecedented array of technologists and activists  from Mo Ibrahim to Bill and Melinda Gates, action/2015, Ushahidi and Sahara Reporters have come together to support a global Connectivity Declaration, pledging their support for the new global goals and connecting the world to opportunity. This needs to become a global movement.In this century, global development and global connectivity are closely linked. If you want to help people feed, heal, educate and employ themselves around the world, we need to connect the world as well. The Internet should not belong to only three billion people, as it does today. It should be seen as a necessity for development, and a tool that makes larger things possible.In Ethiopia and Tanzania, for example, farmers connect to get better prices, track inventory and make mobile insurance payments in case of bad weather. In Nigeria, citizens use BudgIT, a mobile app, to assess whether governments keep their spending promises. The opportunity is especially great for women. Men have significantly more access to the web, but when women get connected, they use technology as a pathway to better education, health, economic status and security. In Guatemala, cellphones inform mothers how to have healthy pregnancies. In Kenya, women receive financial services via their cellphones thanks to the brilliant M-Pesa microfinance scheme.In the last few weeks, weve watched desperate refugees seek shelter on the frontiers of Europe. Smartphones have made it possible for those left behind to communicate with loved ones across checkpoints and razor wire. The Internet connected our world in shared grief as a Syrian childs death on a beach in Turkey came to symbolize every refugee. Social media carried the message and changed not just popular opinion but public policy.Its one thing to say we should connect the world. The real trick is how.Theres no simple solution or silicon bullet.In many places, increasing connectivity will have to start with extending access to energy. Nine out of 10 rural Africans dont have electricity. Governments can make the difference. This is why we support initiatives like President Obamas Power Africa plan and the bipartisan Electrify Africa Act in Congress, as well as the African Development Banks investments in renewable energy.Where governments lay the foundation, the private sector can build. Promising efforts are underway to bridge the digital divide. But we know the global community can, and must, do more  and urgently. The Intel Foundations work in STEM education, Microsofts use of technology to advance the Millennium Development Goals and Googles Project Loon to connect remote locations illustrate how technology leaders are prioritizing this effort, as is Internet.org, Facebooks contribution to meeting the challenge.More technology companies and entrepreneurs must take more responsibility. Silicon Valley should look beyond itself and act more on issues like education, health care and the refugee crisis. We challenge the tech industry to do far more for those most marginalized, those trapped in poverty, and those beyond or on the edge of the network.All the global goals must be scored  but the goal of connectivity for everyone everywhere will surely hurry this game-thats-not-a-game to its successful conclusion. Hurry being the operative word here."
19,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/29/us/politics/transcript-republican-presidential-debate.html,10/29/15,"Following is a transcript of the main Republican debate, as transcribed by the Federal News Service.QUINTANILLA: Good evening, Im Carl Quintanilla, with my colleagues Becky Quick and John Harwood. Well be joined tonight by some of CNBCs top experts on the markets and personal finance.QUINTANILLA: Lets get through the rules of the road. Candidates get 30 seconds to answer the opening question, 60 seconds to answer a formal question, 30 seconds for follow-ups and rebuttals, all at the discretion of the moderators.We want you to weigh in from home. Youll see your tweets at the bottom of the screen. Use the hashtag, #cNBCgopdebate. You can also go to cNBC.com/vote to tell us where you stand throughout the night.So lets introduce the candidates for tonights Republican presidential debate. On the stage from left to right, Governor John Kasich.(APPLAUSE)Governor Mike Huckabee.(APPLAUSE)Governor Jeb Bush.(APPLAUSE)Senator Marco Rubio.(APPLAUSE)Mr. Donald Trump.(APPLAUSE)Dr. Ben Carson.(APPLAUSE)Mrs. Carly Fiorina.(APPLAUSE)Senator Ted Cruz.(APPLAUSE)Governor Chris Christie.(APPLAUSE) And Senator Rand Paul.(APPLAUSE)A lot to get to tonight. So lets get started. This first is an open question.This series of debates is essentially a job interview with the American people. And in any job interview, you know this: you get asked, whats your biggest weakness? So in 30 seconds, without telling us that you try too hard or that youre a perfectionist...(LAUGHTER)...what is your biggest weakness and what are you doing to address it? Well go left to right. Governor Kasich, 30 seconds.KASICH: Good question, but I want to tell you, my great concern is that we are on the verge, perhaps, of picking someone who cannot do this job.Ive watched to see people say that we should dismantle Medicare and Medicaid and leave the senior citizens out  out in the  in the cold. Ive heard them talk about deporting 10 or 11  people here from this country out of this country, splitting families. Ive heard about tax schemes that dont add up, that put our kids in  in a deeper hole than they are today.We need somebody who can lead. We need somebody who can balance budgets, cut taxes...QUINTANILLA: Governor?KASICH: You know, frankly, I did it in Washington, in Ohio, and I will do it again in Washington, if Im president, to get this country moving again.KASICH: country moving again.QUINTANILLA: Governor Huckabee.HUCKABEE: Well, John, I dont really have any weaknesses that I can think of.(LAUGHTER)But my wife is down here in the front, and Im sure, if youd like to talk to her later, she can give you more than youll ever be able to take care of.If I have a weakness, its that I try to live by the rules. I try to live by the rules, no matter what they are, and I was brought up that way as a kid. Play by the rules.And Ill tell you what a weakness is of this country: there are a lot of people who are sick and tired because Washington does not play by the same rules that the American people have to play by.QUINTANILLA: Thank you, Governor. Governor Bush.BUSH: You know, I am by my nature impatient. And this is not an endeavor that rewards that. You gotta be patient. You gotta be  stick with it, and all that.But also, I cant fake anger. I believe this is still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth. And it troubles me that people are rewarded for tearing down our country. Its never been that way in American politics before.BUSH: I cant do it. I just dont believe that this countrys days are going to be deeply  you know, going down. I think were on the verge of the greatest time, and I want to fix the things to let people rise up.QUINTANILLA: Senator Rubio.RUBIO: Thank you for that question. I would begin by saying that Im not sure its a weakness, but I do believe that I share a sense of optimism for Americas future that, today, is eroding from too many of our people.I think theres a sense in this country today that somehow our best days are behind us. And that doesnt have to be true.Our greatest days lie ahead if we are willing to do what it takes now. If were willing to do what it takes now, the 21st century is going to be the new American century, greater than any other era weve had in the history of this great nation.QUINTANILLA: Mr. Trump?TRUMP: I think maybe my greatest weakness is that I trust people too much. Im too trusting. And when they let me down, if they let me down, I never forgive. I find it very, very hard to forgive people that deceived me. So I dont know if you would call that a weakness, but my wife said let up.(LAUGHTER)QUINTANILLA: Dr. Carson?CARSON: Probably in terms of the applying for the job of president, a weakness would be not really seeing myself in that position until hundreds of thousands of people began to tell me that I needed to do it. I do, however, believe in Reagans 11th commandment, and will not be engaging in awful things about my compatriots here.And recognizing that its so important, this election, because were talking about America for the people versus America for the government.QUINTANILLA: Mrs. Fiorina?FIORINA: Well, gee, after the last debate, I was told that I didnt smile enough. (LAUGHTER)QUINTANILLA: Fixed it.FIORINA: But I also think that these are very serious times; 75 percent of the American people think the federal government is corrupt. I agree with them. And this big powerful, corrupt bureaucracy works now only for the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected. Meantime, wages have stagnated for 40 years. We have more Americans out of work or just Americans who quit looking for work for 40 years.Ours was intended to be a citizen government. This is about more than replacing a D with an R. We need a leader who will help us take our government back.QUINTANILLA: Senator Cruz?CRUZ: Im too agreeable, easy going.(LAUGHTER)You know, I think my biggest weakness is exactly the opposite. Im a fighter. I am passionate about what I believe. Ive been passionate my whole life about the Constitution. And, you know, for six-and-a-half years, weve had a gigantic party. If you want someone to grab a beer with, I may not be that guy. But if you want someone to drive you home, I will get the job done and I will get you home.QUINTANILLA: Governor Christie?CHRISTIE: I dont see a lot of weakness on this stage, quite frankly. Where I see the weakness is in those three people that are left on the Democratic stage. You know, I see a socialist, an isolationist and a pessimist. And for the sake of me, I cant figure out which one is which.(LAUGHTER)But I will  but I will tell you this, the socialist says theyre going to pay for everything and give you everything for free, except they dont say theyre going to raise it through taxes to 90 percent to do it. The isolationist is the one who wants to continue to follow a foreign policy that has fewer democracies today than when Barack Obama came into office around the world.But I know who the pessimist is. Its Hillary Clinton. And you put me on that stage against her next September, she wont get within 10 miles of the White House. Take it to the bank.QUINTANILLA: Senator Paul?PAUL: You know, I left my medical practice and ran for office because I was concerned about an $18 trillion debt. We borrow a million dollars a minute. Now, on the floor of the Congress, the Washington establishment from both parties puts forward a bill that will explode the deficit. It allows President Obama to borrow unlimited amounts of money.I will stand firm. I will spend every ounce of energy to stop it. I will begin tomorrow to filibuster it. And I ask everyone in America to call Congress tomorrow and say enough is enough; no more debt.QUINTANILLA: Thanks to all the candidates.John?HARWOOD: Mr. Trump, youve done very well in this campaign so far by promising to build a wall and make another country pay for it.TRUMP: Right.HARWOOD: Send 11 million people out of the country. Cut taxes $10 trillion without increasing the deficit.TRUMP: Right.HARWOOD: And make Americans better off because your greatness would replace the stupidity and incompetence of others.TRUMP: Thats right.HARWOOD: Lets be honest.(LAUGHTER)Is this a comic book version of a presidential campaign?TRUMP: No, not a comic book, and its not a very nicely asked question the way you say that.Larry Kudlow is an example, who I have a lot of respect for, who loves my tax plan. Were reducing taxes to 15 percent. Were bringing corporate taxes down, bringing money back in, corporate inversions. We have $2.5 trillion outside of the United States which we want to bring back in.As far as the wall is concerned, were going to build a wall. Were going to create a border. Were going to let people in, but theyre going to come in legally. Theyre going to come in legally. And its something that can be done, and I get questioned about that. They built the great wall of China. Thats 13,000 miles. Here, we actually need 1,000 because we have natural barriers. So we need 1,000.TRUMP: We can do a wall. Were going to have a big, fat beautiful door right in the middle of the wall. Were going to have people come in, but theyre coming in legally. And Mexicos going to pay for the wall because Mexico  I love the Mexican people; I respect the Mexican leaders  but the leaders are much sharper, smarter and more cunning than our leaders.And just to finish, people say, how will you get Mexico to pay? A politician other than the people in the states  I dont want to  a politician cannot get them to pay. I can. We lose, we have a trade imbalance...Excuse me, John.... of $50 billion...HARWOOD: Were at the 60 seconds.TRUMP: ... believe me the world is peanuts by comparison.HARWOOD: Were at 60 seconds, but I gotta ask you, you talked about your tax plan. You say that it would not increase the deficit because you cut taxes $10 trillion in the economy would take off like...(CROSSTALK)HARWOOD: Hold on, hold on. The economy would take off like a rocket ship.TRUMP: Right. Dynamically.HARWOOD: I talked to economic advisers who have served presidents of both parties. They said that you have as chance of cutting taxes that much without increasing the deficit as you would of flying away from that podium by flapping your arms.TRUMP: Then you have to get rid of Larry Kudlow, who sits on your panel, whos a great guy, who came out the other day and said, I love Trumps tax plan.(CROSSTALK)HARWOOD: The Tax Foundation says  has looked at all of our plans and  and his creates, even with the dynamic effect, $8 trillion dollar deficit... QUICK: Gentlemen  well  well get back to this  just a minute  just a minute were gonna continue this.I wanna talk taxes...QUINTANILLA: Hold it. Well cut it back to you in just a minute. Beckys moving on.QUICK: Dr. Carson, lets talk about taxes.You have a flat tax plan of 10 percent flat taxes, and  Ive looked at it  and this is something that is very appealing to a lot of voters, but Ive had a really tough time trying to make the math work on this.If you were to took a 10 percent tax, with the numbers right now in total personal income, youre gonna come in with bring in $1.5 trillion. That is less than half of what we bring in right now. And by the way, its gonna leave us in a $2 trillion hole.So what analysis got you to the point where you think this will work?CARSON: Well, first of all, I didnt say that the rate would be 10 percent. I used the tithing analogy.QUICK: I  I understand that, but if you  if you look at the numbers you probably have to get to 28.CARSON: The rate  the rate  the rate is gonna be much closer to 15 percent.QUICK: 15 percent still leaves you with a $1.1 trillion hole.CARSON: You also have to get rid of all the deductions and all the loopholes. You also have to some strategically cutting in several places.Remember, we have 645 federal agencies and sub-agencies. Anybody who tells me that we need every penny and every one of those is in a fantasy world.So, also, we can stimulate the economy. Thats gonna be the real growth engine. Stimulating the economy  because its tethered down right now with so many regulations...QUICK: Youd have to cut  youd have to cut government about 40 percent to make it work with a $1.1 trillion hole.CARSON: Thats not true.QUICK: That is true, I looked at the numbers.CARSON: When  when we put all the facts down, youll be able to see that its not true, it works out very well.QUICK: Dr. Carson, thank you.KASICH: Listen, I want to just comment.HARWOOD: Governor Kasich, hold it, Im coming to you right now. The...KASICH: Well I want to comment on this. This is the fantasy...HARWOOD: Well, Im asking you about this.KASICH: This is the fantasy that I talked about in the beginning.HARWOOD: Im about to ask you about this.That is, you had some very strong words to say yesterday about whats happening in your party and what youre hearing from the two gentlemen weve just heard from. Would you repeat it?KASICH: Im the only person on this stage that actually was involved in the chief architect of balancing the Federal Budget.You cant do it with empty promised. You know, these plans would put us trillions and trillions of dollars in debt.I actually have a plan. Im the only one on this stage that has a plan that would create jobs, cut taxes, balance the budget and can get it done because Im realistic. You just dont make promises like this.Why dont we just give a chicken in every pot, while were, you know, coming up  coming up with these fantasy tax schemes. Well just clean it up. Where are you gonna clean it up?You have to deal with entitlements, you have to be in a position to control discretionary spending. You gotta be creative and imaginative.Now, let me just be clear, John. I went into Ohio where we had an $8 billion hole and now we have a $2 billion surplus. Were up 347,000 jobs.When I was in Washington, I fought to get the budget balanced. I was the architect. It was the first time we did it since man walked on the moon. We cut taxes and we had a $5 trillion projected surplus when I left.Thats was hard work. Fiscal discipline, know what youre doing. Creativity.This stuff is fantasy. Just like getting rid of Medicare and Medicaid. Come on, thats just not  you scare senior citizens with that. Its not responsible.HARWOOD: Well, lets just get more pointed about it. You said yesterday that you were hearing proposals that were just crazy from your colleagues.Who were you talking about?KASICH: Well, I mean right here. To talk about were just gonna have a 10 percent tithe and thats how were gonna fund the government? And were going to just fix everything with waste, fraud, and abuse? Or that were just going to be great? Or were going to ship 10 million Americans  or 10 million people out of this country, leaving their children here in this country and dividing families?Folks, weve got to wake up. We cannot elect somebody that doesnt know how to do the job. You have got to pick somebody who has experience, somebody that has the know-how, the discipline.And I spent my entire lifetime balancing federal budgets, growing jobs, the same in Ohio. And I will go back to Washington with my plan.QUINTANILLA: Governor  Governor. thank you, Governor.KASICH: And I will have done it within 100 days, and it will pass. And we will be strong again. Thank you.QUINTANILLA: Mr. Trump, 30 seconds.TRUMP: First of all, John got lucky with a thing called fracking, OK? He hit oil. He got lucky with fracking. Believe me, that is why Ohio is doing well. Number  and that is important for you to know.Number two, this was the man that was a managing general partner at Lehman Brothers when it went down the tubes and almost took every one of us with it, including Ben and myself, because I was there and I watched what happened.And Lehman Brothers started it all. He was on the board. And he was a managing general partner.And just thirdly, he was so nice. He was such a nice guy. And he said, oh, Im never going to attack. But then his poll numbers tanked. He has got  that is why he is on the end.(LAUGHTER) And he got nasty. And he got nasty. So you know what? You can have him.(CROSSTALK)KASICH: Let me just  let me respond. First of all, Ohio does have an energy industry, but were diversified. Were one of the fastest growing states in the country. We came back from the dead. And you know what? It works very, very well.And secondly, when you talk about me being on the board of Lehman Brothers, I wasnt on the board of Lehman Brothers. I was a banker and I was proud of it. And I traveled the country and learned how people made jobs.We ought to have politicians who not only have government experience but know how the CEOs and the job creators work. My state is doing great across the board. And guess what, in 2011, I got a deal...QUICK: Governor...KASICH: ... an agreement with the...(CROSSTALK)KASICH: ... that he tried to take credit for four years later. Its a joke.QUINTANILLA: Thank you, Governor.QUICK: Dr. Carson, let me get 30 seconds with Dr. Carson...(CROSSTALK)CARSON: Since I was attacked too.QUICK: Thank you.CARSON: Let me just say, if youre talking about an $18 trillion economy, youre talking about a 15 percent tax on your gross domestic product. Youre talking about $2.7 trillion. We have a budget closer to $3.5 trillion.But if you also apply that same 15 percent to several other things, including corporate taxes, and including the capital gains taxes, you make that amount up pretty quickly. So that is not by any stretch a pie in the sky.CRUZ: Becky, if you want a 10 percent flat tax where the numbers add up, I rolled out my tax plan today, you can find it on line at tedcruz.org. It is a simple flat tax where for individuals, a family of four pays nothing on the first $36,000.After that you pay 10 percent as a flat tax going up. The billionaire and the working man, no hedge fund manager pays less than his secretary.On top of that, there is a business flat tax of 16 percent. Now that applies universally to giant corporations that with lobbyists right now are not paying taxes, and as small business.And you wanted to know the numbers, the Tax Foundation, which has scored every one of our plans, shows that this plan will allow the economy to generate 4.9 million jobs, to raise wages over 12 percent, and to generate 14 percent growth.And it costs, with dynamic scoring, less than a trillion dollars. Those are the hard numbers. And every single income decile sees a double-digit increase in after-tax income.QUICK: Senator  Senator, thank you.CRUZ: Growth is the answer. And as Reagan demonstrated, if we cut taxes, we can bring back growth.QUICK: Gentlemen, Im sorry, we need to...(CROSSTALK)QUINTANILLA: Were going to try to move on.(CROSSTALK)FIORINA: Let me just say on taxes, how long have we been talking about tax reform in Washington, D.C.? We have been talking about it for decades. We now have a 73,000-page tax code.There have been more than 4,000 changes to the tax plan since 2001 alone. There are loads of great ideas, great conservative ideas from wonderful think tanks about how to reform the tax code.The problem is we never get it done. We have talked about tax reform in every single election for decades. It never happens. And the politicians always say it is so complicated, nobody but a politician can figure it out.The truth is this, the big problem, we need a leader in Washington who understands how to get something done, not to talk about it, not to propose it, to get it done.QUINTANILLA: You want to bring 70,000 pages to three?FIORINA: Thats right, three pages.QUINTANILLA: Is that using really small type?FIORINA: You know why three?QUINTANILLA: Is that using really small type?FIORINA: No. You know why three? Because only if its about three pages are you leveling the playing field between the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected who can hire the armies of lawyers and accountants and, yes, lobbyists to help them navigate their way through 73,000 pages.Three pages is about the maximum that a single business owner or a farmer or just a couple can understand without hiring somebody. Almost 60 percent of American people now need to hire an expert to understand their taxes.So yes, youre going to hear a lot of talk about tax reform QUINTANILLA: Mrs. Fiorina FIORINA:  the issue is who is going to get it done.(CROSSTALK)QUINTANILLA: Were going to QUICK: Were going to move on.QUINTANILLA: We will come around the bend, i promise. This one is for Senator Rubio. Youve been a young man in a hurry ever since you won your first election in your 20s. Youve had a big accomplishment in the Senate, an immigration bill providing a path to citizenship the conservatives in your party hate, and even you dont support anymore. Now, youre skipping more votes than any senator to run for president. Why not slow down, get a few more things done first or least finish what you start?RUBIO: Thats an interesting question. Thats exactly what the Republican establishment says too. Why dont you wait in line? Wait for what? This country is running out of time. We cant afford to have another four years like the last eight years.Watching this broadcast tonight are millions of people that are living paycheck to paycheck. Theyre working as hard as they ever have, everything costs more, and they havent had a raise in decades.You have small businesses in America that are struggling. For the first time in 35 years, we have more businesses closing than starting. We have a world thats out of control and has grown dangerous and a president that is weakening our military and making our foreign policy unstable and unreliable in the eyes of our allies. And our adversaries continue to grow stronger.We have a  they say theres no bipartisanship in Washington? We have a $19 trillion bipartisan debt and it continues to grow as we borrow money from countries that do not like us to pay for government we cannot afford.The time to act is now. The time to turn the page is now. If we  if we dont act now, we are going to be the first generation in American history that leaves our children worse off than ourselves.QUINTANILLA: So when the Sun-Sentinel says Rubio should resign, not rip us off, when they say Floridians sent you to Washington to do a job, when they say you act like you hate your job, do you?RUBIO: Let me say, I read that editorial today with a great amusement. Its actually evidence of the bias that exists in the American media today.QUINTANILLA: Well, do you hate your job?RUBIO: Let me  let me answer your question on the Sun-Sentinel editorial today. Back in 2004, one of my predecessors to the Senate by the name of Bob Graham, a Democrat, ran for president missing over 30 percent of his votes. I dont recall them calling for his resignation QUINTANILLA: Is that the standard?RUBIO: Later that year, in 2004, John Kerry ran for president missing close to 60 to 70 percent of his votes. I dont recall the Sun  in fact, the Sun-Sentinel endorsed him. In 2008, Barack Obama missed 60 or 70 percent of his votes, and the same newspaper endorsed him again. So this is another example of the double standard that exists in this country between the mainstream media and the conservative movement.(APPLAUSE)QUINTANILLA: Senator, thank you. John.BUSH: Could I  could I bring something up here, because Im a constituent of the senator and I helped him and I expected that he would do constituent service, which means that he shows up to work. He got endorsed by the Sun-Sentinel because he was the most talented guy in the field. Hes a gifted politician.But Marco, when you signed up for this, this was a six-year term, and you should be showing up to work. I mean, literally, the Senate  what is it, like a French work week? You get, like, three days where you have to show up? You can campaign, or just resign and let someone else take the job. There are a lot of people living paycheck to paycheck in Florida as well, theyre looking for a senator that will fight for them each and every day.RUBIO: I get to respond, right?QUICK: Thirty seconds.RUBIO: Well, its interesting. Over the last few weeks, Ive listened to Jeb as he walked around the country and said that youre modeling your campaign after John McCain, that youre going to launch a furious comeback the way he did, by fighting hard in New Hampshire and places like that, carrying your own bag at the airport. You know how many votes John McCain missed when he was carrying out that furious comeback that youre now modeling after?BUSH: He wasnt my senator.RUBIO: No Jeb, I dont remember  well, let me tell you. I dont remember you ever complaining about John McCains vote record. The only reason why youre doing it now is because were running for the same position, and someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you.BUSH: Well, Ive been RUBIO: Heres the bottom line.(APPLAUSE)Im not  my campaign is going to be about the future of America, its not going to be about attacking anyone else on this stage. I will continue to have tremendous admiration and respect for Governor Bush. Im not running against Governor Bush, Im not running against anyone on this stage. Im running for president because there is no way we can elect Hillary Clinton to continue the policies of Barack Obama.QUINTANILLA: Thank you, Senator.TRUMP: I think youre (APPLAUSE)(CROSSTALK)HARWOOD: Hold on. I think theres a  Ive got question for (CROSSTALK)KASICH: John Harwood, theres a bigger issue here.HARWOOD: Hold on, Governor. Ive got a question for Governor Bush.(CROSSTALK)HARWOOD: No, were moving to Governor Bush. Governor, the fact that youre at the fifth lectern tonight shows how far your stock has fallen in this race, despite the big investment your donors have made.HARWOOD: You noted recently, after slashing your payroll, that you had better things to do than sit around and be demonized by other people. I wanted to ask you BUSH: No, no. What I said was I dont believe that I would be president of the United States and have the same dysfunction that exists in Washington, D.C. now.HARWOOD: OK.BUSH: Dont vote for me if you want to keep the gridlock in Washington, D.C.HARWOOD: Got it.BUSH: But if you want someone who has a proven, effective leadership, that was a governor of a state, that transformed the culture there, elect me so I can fight for the American people and change the culture in Washington, D.C.HARWOOD: But its a  OK. Its a  its a question about why youre having difficulty. I want to ask you in this context.Ben Bernanke, who was appointed Fed chairman by your brother, recently wrote a book in which he said he no longer considers himself a Republican because the Republican Party has given in to know- nothingism. Is that why youre having a difficult time in this race?BUSH: (inaudible), the great majority of Republicans and Americans believe in a hopeful future. They dont believe in building walls and a pessimistic view of the future.Theyre concerned that Washington is so dysfunctional it is holding them back. There are lids on peoples aspirations. Think about it: six and a half million people working part-time. Workforce participation rates lower than they were in 1977.Six million more people living in poverty than the day that Barack Obama got elected president, and the left just wants more of the same. We have to offer a compelling alternative that is based on hope and optimism and grounded in serious policy, which Ive laid out.And you can go get it at jeb2016.com.HARWOOD: Thank you, Governor.(CROSSTALK)HARWOOD: Were gonna get down the line. Beckys got a question.QUICK: Well get to everyone.Ms. Fiorina, I  Id like to ask you a question. You are running for president of the United States because of your record running Hewlett-Packard. But the stock market is usually a fair indicator of the performance of a CEO, and the market was not kind to you.Someone who invested a dollar in your company the day you took office had lost half of the dollar by the day you left. Obviously, youve talked in the past about what a difficult time it was for technology companies, but anybody who was following the market knows that your stock was a much worse performer, if you looked at your competitors, if you looked at the overall market.I just wonder, in terms of all of that  you know, we look back, your board fired you. I just wondered why you think we should hire you now.FIORINA: You know, the NASDAQ dropped 80 percent  80 percent  and it took 15 years for the NASDAQ to recover. I was recruited to H.P. to save a company.It was a company that had grown into a bloated, inept bureaucracy that cost too much and delivered too little to customers and shareholders. It had missed, before I had arrived, expectations for nine quarters in a row.As an outsider, I tackled H.P.s entrenched problems head-on. I cut the bureaucracy down to size, re-introduced accountability, focused on service, on innovation, on leading in every market, in every product segment.And yes, it was a very difficult time. However, we saved 80,000 jobs and we went on to grow to 160,000 jobs, and scores of technology companies literally went out of business  like Gateway  taking all their jobs with them.The truth is I had to make some tough calls in some tough times. I think, actually, people are looking for that in Washington now. And yes, I was fired over a disagreement in the boardroom. There are politics in the boardroom as well.And yet the man who led my firing, Tom Perkins, an icon of Silicon Valley, has come out publicly and said, you know what? We were wrong. She was right. She was a great CEO. Shed be a great president of the United States because the leadership she brought to H.P. is exactly the leadership we need in Washington, D.C.QUICK: Mrs. Fiorina, its interesting that you bring up Mr. Perkins, because...(APPLAUSE) ...he said a lot of very questionable things. Last year, in an interview, he said that he thinks wealthy people should get more votes than poor people.I think his quote was that, if you pay zero dollars in taxes, you should get zero votes. If you pay a million dollars, you should get a million votes. Is this the type of person you want defending you?FIORINA: Well, this is one of the reasons why Tom Perkins and I had disagreements in the boardroom, Becky.(LAUGHTER)Nevertheless, one of the things that I think people dont always understand is how accountable a CEO actually is.So you know, I had to report results every 90 days in excruciating detail. I had to answer every single question about every single result and every single projection in public until there were no more questions.And if I misrepresented those results or those projections in any way, I was held criminally liable.

20,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/15/us/politics/transcript-of-republican-presidential-debate.html,1/15/16,"Following is a transcript of the main Republican presidential debate, as transcribed by the Federal News Service.NEIL CAVUTO: It is 9:00 p.m. here at the North Charleston Coliseum and Performing Arts Center in South Carolina. Welcome to the sixth Republican presidential debate of the 2016 campaign, here on the Fox Business Network.Im Neil Cavuto, alongside my friend and co-moderator Maria Bartiromo.MARIA BARTIROMO: Tonight we are working with Facebook to ask the candidates the questions voters want answered. And according to Facebook, the U.S. election has dominated the global conversation, with 131 million people talking about the 2016 race. That makes it the number one issue talked about on Facebook last year worldwide.CAVUTO: Now, the seven candidates on the stage tonight were selected based on their standing in six national polls, as well as polls in the early-voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire, those standings determining the position on the stage of the candidates tonight. And here they are.Businessman Donald Trump.(APPLAUSE)Texas senator Ted Cruz.(APPLAUSE)Florida senator Marco Rubio.(APPLAUSE)Neurosurgeon Ben Carson.(APPLAUSE)New Jersey governor Chris Christie.(APPLAUSE)Former Florida governor Jeb Bush.And Ohio governor John Kasich.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Tonights rules are simple: up to 90 seconds for each answer, one minute for each follow-up response. And if a candidate goes over the allotted time, youll hear this.(BELL RINGS) So lets get started. Candidates, jobs and growth  two of the biggest issues facing the country right now. In his State of the Union address earlier this week, the president said, quote, we have the strongest, most durable economy in the world.And according to our Facebook research, jobs is one of the biggest issues resonating across the country, including here in South Carolina. The president is touting 14 million new jobs and an unemployment rate cut in half.The president said that anyone who claims Americas economy is in decline is peddling fiction. Senator Cruz, what do you see that he doesnt?CRUZ: Well, Maria, thank you for that question, and let me say thank you to the state of South Carolina for welcoming us.Let me start  I want to get to the substance of the question on jobs, but I want to start with something. Today, many of us picked up our newspapers, and we were horrified to see the sight of 10 American sailors on their knees, with their hands on their heads.In that State of the Union, President Obama didnt so much as mention the 10 sailors that had been captured by Iran. President Obamas preparing to send $100 billion or more to the Ayatollah Khamenei. And Ill tell you, it was heartbreaking.But the good news is the next commander-in-chief is standing on this stage. (APPLAUSE)And I give you my word, if I am elected president, no service man or service woman will be forced to be on their knees, and any nation that captures our fighting men will feel the full force and fury of the United States of America.(APPLAUSE)Now, on to your substantive question. The president tried to paint a rosy picture of jobs. And you know, hes right. If youre a Washington lobbyist, if you make your money in and around Washington, things are doing great. The millionaires and billionaires are doing great under Obama. But we have the lowest percentage of Americans working today of any year since 1977. Median wages have stagnated. And the Obama-Clinton economy has left behind the working men and women of this country.The reason all of us are here is we believe we should be fighting for the working men and women of this country, and not Washington, D.C.BARTIROMO: Thank you, sir.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Governor Kasich, we are not even two weeks into this stock trading year, but (inaudible) investors already lost $1.6 trillion in market value. That makes it the worst start to a new year ever. Many worry that things will get even worse, and that banks and financial stocks are particularly vulnerable.Now, if this escalates, like it did back when Barack Obama first assumed the presidency, what actions would you take if this same thing happens all over again just as, in this example, you are taking over the presidency?KASICH: Look, it takes three things basically to grow jobs. And Ive done it when I was in Washington when we had a balanced budget; had four years of balanced budgets; paid down a half-trillion of debt. And our economy was growing like crazy. Its the same thing that I did in Ohio. Its a simple formula: common sense regulations, which is why I think we should freeze all federal regulations for one year, except for health and safety. It requires tax cuts, because that sends a message to the job creators that things are headed the right way. And if you tax cuts  if you cut taxes for corporations, and you cut taxes for individuals, youre going to make things move, particularly the corporate tax, which is the highest, of course, in the  in the world.But in addition to that, we have to have fiscal discipline. We have to show that we can march to a balanced budget. And when you do that, when youre in a position of managing regulations; when you reduce taxes; and when you have fiscal discipline, you see the job creators begin to get very comfortable with the fact that they can invest.Right now, you dont have the  you have taxes that are too high. You have regulations  I mean, come on, theyre affecting everybody here, particularly our small businesses. They are  theyre in a position where theyre smothering people. And I mean, are you kidding me? Were nowhere close to a balanced budget or fiscal discipline.Those three things put together are going to give confidence to job creators and you will begin to see wages rise. You will begin to see jobs created in a robust economy. And how do I know it? Because Ive done it. I did it as the chairman of the Budget Committee, working with Senator Domenici. And Ive done it in the state of Ohio as the chief executive.Our wages are growing faster than the national average. Were running surpluses. And we can take that message and that formula to Washington to lift every single American to a better life.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: We know that recent global events have many people worried  Iran detaining American sailors, forcing them to apologize; North Korea and its nuclear ambitions; an aggressive China; and a Middle East that continues to deteriorate, not to mention ISIS is getting stronger.Governor Christie, sometimes it seems the world is on fire. Where and when should a president use military action to restore order?CHRISTIE: Well, Maria, Im glad to have heard from you in the summary of that question about whats going on in the world. Because Tuesday night, I watched story time with Barack Obama. And Ive got to tell you, it sounded like everything in the world was going amazing, you know?(APPLAUSE)The fact is, theres a number of things that the next president is going to have to do to clean up this mess. The first thing is we have to strengthen our alliances around the world. And the best way to do that is to start talking to our allies again and having them be able to count on our word.Lots of people will say lots of different things about me in this campaign and others, but the one thing theyve never said about me is that Im misunderstood. And so when we talk to our allies and we give them our word, in a Christie administration, they know were going to keep it.Next, we have to talk to our adversaries, and we have to make sure they understand the limits of our patience. And this president, given what Ted said right at the beginning, hes absolutely right. Its a  its absolutely disgraceful that Secretary Kerry and others said in their response to whats going on in Iran that this was a good thing; it showed how the relationship was getting better.The president doesnt understand  and by the way, neither does Secretary Clinton  and heres my warning to everybody out in the audience tonight. If youre worried about the world being on fire, youre worried about how were going to use our military, youre worried about strengthening our military and youre worried most of all about keeping your homes and your families safe and secure, you cannot give Hillary Clinton a third term of Barack Obamas leadership.I will not do that. If Im the nominee, she wont get within 10 miles of the White House.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Just to be clear Governor, where and when would you use military action?CHRISTIE: MIlitary action, Maria, would be used when it was absolutely necessary to protect American lives and protect American interests around the world. We are not the worlds policeman, but we need to stand up and be ready.And the problem, Maria, is that the military is not ready, either. We need to rebuild our military, and this president has let it diminish to a point where tinpot dictators like the mullahs in Iran are taking our Navy ships. It is disgraceful, and in a Christie administration, they would know much, much better than to do that.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Governor Bush, the president just told the nation two nights ago that America is back and that the idea that our enemies are getting stronger or that this country is getting weaker, well, its just rhetoric and hot air. Now other Democrats go even further, sir, saying Republicans even suggesting such comments actually embolden our enemies. I guess they would include you. What do you say?BUSH: Well first of all, the idea that somehow were better off today than the day that Barack Obama was inaugurated president of the United States is totally an alternative universe. The simple fact is that the world has been torn asunder.Think about it. With grandiose language, the president talks about red lines and nothing to follow it up; talks about ISIS being the JV team, they form a caliphate the size of Indiana with 35 (thousand) to 40,000 battle-tested terrorists. Hes missing the whole point, that Americas leadership in the world is required for peace and stability.In the crowd today is Major General James Livingston, whos the co-chairman of my campaign here in South Carolina, a Medal of Honor recipient.(APPLAUSE)Ive learned from him that what we need to achieve is peace through strength, which means we need to rebuild the military. In this administration, every weapon system has been gutted, in this administration, the force levels are going down to a level where we cant even project force. Our friends no longer think we have their back and our enemies no longer fear us, and were in a much difficult  were in a much different position than we should be.And for the life of me, I have no understanding why the president thinks that everything is going well. Terrorism is on the run, China, Russia is advancing their agenda at warp speed, and we pull back.As president of the United States, I will be a commander in chief that will have the back of the military. We will rebuild the military to make sure that it is a solid force, not to be the worlds policeman, but to make sure that in a peaceful world, people know that the United States is there to take care of our own national interests and take care of our allies.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: So I take it from that you do not agree with the president.BUSH: No. And worse  worse yet, to be honest with you, Hillary Clinton would be a national security disaster.Think about it. She wants to continue down the path of Iran, Benghazi, the Russian reset, Dodd-Frank, all the things that have  that have gone wrong in this country, she would be a national security mess. And that is wrong.And you know what? Heres the problem. If she gets elected, shes under investigation with the FBI right now. If she gets elected, her first 100 days, instead of setting an agenda, she might be going back and forth between the White House and the courthouse. We need to stop that. (LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Senator Rubio, the president says that ISIS doesnt threaten our national existence like a Germany or a Japan back in World War II, that the terror group is nothing more than twisted souls plotting attacks in their garages.But House Homeland Security Committee recently said that over 1,000 ongoing investigations of homegrown extremism in 50 states. So how do you define the threat? Germany then or dangerous nut cases now?RUBIO: Yeah, I would go, first of all, one step further in this description of Hillary Clinton. She wouldnt just be a disaster, Hillary Clinton is disqualified from being commander in chief of the United States.(APPLAUSE)Someone who cannot handle intelligence information appropriately cannot be commander in chief and someone who lies to the families of those four victims in Benghazi can never be president of the United States. Ever.(APPLAUSE)On the issue of Barack Obama, Barack Obama does not believe that America is a great global power. Barack Obama believes that America is a arrogant global power that needs to be cut down to size. And thats how you get a foreign policy where we cut deals with our enemies like Iran and we betray our allies like Israel and we gut our military and we go around the world like he has done on 10 separate occasions and apologized for America.He doesnt understand the threat in ISIS. He consistently underestimates it but I do not. There is a war against ISIS, not just against ISIS but against radical jihadists terrorists, and it is a war that they win or we win.When Im president of the United States, we are going to win this war on ISIS. The most powerful intelligence agency in the world is going to tell us where we are, the most powerful military in the world is going to destroy them. And if we capture any of them alive, they are getting a one-way ticket to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we are going to find out everything they know.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Thank you, Senator.BARTIROMO: Dr. Carson, the president says he does not want to treat ISIS as a foreign army, but ISIS is neither a country nor a government. How do you attack a network that does not respect national borders?CARSON: Well, Im very happy to get a question this early on. I was going to ask you to wake me up when that time came.(LAUGHTER)You know, I find it really quite fascinating some of the presidents proclamations. The fact of the matter is he doesnt realize that we now live in the 21st century, and that war is very different than it used to be before. Not armies massively marching on each other and air forces, but now we have dirty bombs and we have cyber attacks and we have people who will be attacking our electrical grid. And, you know, we have a whole variety of things that they can do and they can do these things simultaneously. And we have enemies who are obtaining nuclear weapons that they can explode in our exoatmosphere and destroy our electric grid.I mean, just think about a scenario like that. They explode the bomb, we have an electromagnetic pulse. They hit us with a cyberattack simultaneously and dirty bombs. Can you imagine the chaos that would ensue at that point? He needs to recognize that those kinds of things are in fact an existential threat to us.But heres the real key. We have the worlds best military, even though hes done everything he can to diminish it. And the fact of the matter is if we give them a mission and we dont tie their hands behind their back, they can get it accomplished.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Mr. Trump, at the State of the Union, the president pointed to a guest who was a Syrian refugee you might recall whose wife and daughter and other family members were killed in an air attack. Now he fled that country seeking asylum here, ultimately ended up in Detroit where hes now trying to start a new life.The president says that that doctor is the real face of these refugees and not the one that you and some of your colleagues on this stage are painting; that you prefer the face of fear and terror and that you would refuse to let in anyone into this country seeking legitimate asylum. How do you answer that?TRUMP: Its not fear and terror, its reality. You just have to look today at Indonesia, bombings all over.(APPLAUSE)You look at California, you look, frankly, at Paris where theres a  the strictest no-gun policy of any city anywhere in the world, and you see what happens: 130 people dead with many to follow. Theyre very, very badly wounded. They will  some will follow. And you look around, and you see whats happening, and this is not the case when he introduced the doctor  very nice, everything perfect but that is not representative of what you have in that line of migration.That could be the great Trojan Horse. It could be people that are going to do great, great destruction. When I look at the migration, I looked at the line, I said it actually on your show recently, where are the women? It looked like very few women. Very few children. Strong, powerful men, young and people are looking at that and theyre saying whats going on?You look at the kind of damage that two people that two people that got married, they were radicalized  they got married, they killed 15 people in actually 15  going to be probably 16 but you look at that and you take a look  a good strong look and thats what we have. We are nineteen trillion dollars  our countrys a mess and we cant let all these people come into our country and break our borders. We cant do it.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Senator Cruz, the New York Times is reporting that you failed to properly disclose a million dollars in loans from Goldman Sachs and CitiBank. During your senate race, your campaign said, it was inadvertent. A million dollars is inadvertent?CRUZ: Well Maria, thank you for passing on that hit piece in the front page of the New York Times. You know the nice thing about the mainstream media, they dont hide their views. The New York Times a few weeks back had a columnist who wrote a column saying, Anybody But Cruz. Had that actually  that same columnist wrote a column comparing me to an evil demonic spirit from the move, It Follows that jumps apparently from body to body possessing people.So you know the New York Times and I dont have exactly have the warmest of relationships. Now in terms of their really stunning hit piece, what they mentioned is when I was running for senate  unlike Hillary Clinton, I dont have masses of money in the bank, hundreds of millions of dollars. When I was running for senate just about every lobbyist, just about all of the establishment opposed me in the senate race in Texas and my opponent in that race was worth over 200 million dollars. He put a 25 million dollar check up from his own pocket to fund that campaign and my wife Heidi and I, we ended up investing everything we owned.We took a loan against our assets to invest it in that campaign to defend ourselves against those attacks. And the entire New York times attack  is that I disclosed that loan on one filing with the United States Senate, that was a public filing. But it was not on a second filing with FDIC and yes, I made a paperwork error disclosing it on one piece of paper instead of the other. But if thats the best the New York Times has got, they better go back to the well. BARTIROMO: Thank you.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CAVUTO: All right. Welcome back to the Republican presidential debate, right here in North Charleston, South Carolina. Lets get right back to the questions. And Ill start with you, Senator Cruz.Now you are, of course, a strict constitutionalist  no one would doubt that. And as you know, the U.S. Constitution says only natural-born citizens are eligible for the office of president of the United States. Stop me if youve heard this before. Now, you were born...(LAUGHTER)... you were born in Canada to an American mother. So you were and are considered an American citizen. But that fellow next to you, Donald Trump  and others  have said that being born in Canada means you are not natural-born, and that has raised questions about your eligibility.Do you want to try to close this topic once and for all tonight?CRUZ: Well, Neil, Im glad were focusing on the important topics of the evening.(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)You know, back in September, my friend Donald said that he had had his lawyers look at this from every which way, and there was no issue there. There was nothing to this birther issue.(LAUGHTER)Now, since September, the Constitution hasnt changed.(LAUGHTER)But the poll numbers have.(APPLAUSE)And I recognize  I recognize that Donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in Iowa. But the facts and the law here are really quite clear. Under longstanding U.S. law, the child of a U.S. citizen born abroad is a natural-born citizen.If a soldier has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen. Thats why John McCain, even though he was born in Panama, was eligible to run for president.If an American missionary has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen. Thats why George Romney, Mitts dad, was eligible to run for president, even though he was born in Mexico.At the end of the day, the legal issue is quite straightforward, but I would note that the birther theories that Donald has been relying on  some of the more extreme ones insist that you must not only be born on U.S. soil, but have two parents born on U.S. soil.Under that theory, not only would I be disqualified, Marco Rubio would be disqualified, Bobby Jindal would be disqualified and, interestingly enough, Donald J. Trump would be disqualified.(APPLAUSE)(UNKNOWN): Not me.CRUZ: Because  because Donalds mother was born in Scotland. She was naturalized. Now, Donald...TRUMP: But I was born here.CRUZ: ... on the issue  on the issue of citizenship, Donald...TRUMP: (inaudible). Big difference.CRUZ: ... on the issue of citizenship, Donald, Im not going to use your mothers birth against you.TRUMP: OK, good. Because it wouldnt work.CRUZ: Youre an American, as is everybody else on this stage, and I would suggest we focus on whos best prepared to be commander- in-chief, because thats the most important question facing the country.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Mr. Trump...(CROSSTALK)CAVUTO: ... that you raised it because of his rising poll numbers.TRUMP: ... first of all, let me just tell you something  and you know, because you just saw the numbers yourself  NBC Wall Street Journal just came out with a poll  headline: Trump way up, Cruz going down. I mean, so dont  so you cant  you cant...(BOOING)... they dont like the Wall Street Journal. They dont like NBC, but I like the poll.(LAUGHTER)And frankly, it just came out, and in Iowa now, as you know, Ted, in the last three polls, Im beating you. So  you know, you shouldnt misrepresent how well youre doing with the polls.(APPLAUSE)You dont have to say that. In fact, I was all for you until you started doing that, because thats a misrepresentation, number one.Number two, this isnt me saying it. I dont care. I think Im going to win fair and square (inaudible) to win this way. Thank you.Lawrence Tribe and (inaudible) from Harvard  of Harvard, said that there is a serious question as to whether or not Ted can do this. OK? There are other attorneys that feel, and very, very fine constitutional attorneys, that feel that because he was not born on the land, he cannot run for office.Heres the problem. Were running. Were running. He does great. I win. I choose him as my vice presidential candidate, and the Democrats sue because we cant take him along for the ride. I dont like that. OK?(LAUGHTER)The fact is  and if for some reason he beats the rest of the field, he beats the rest of the field (inaudible). See, they dont like that. They dont like that.(AUDIENCE BOOING)No, they dont like he beats the rest of the field, because they want me.(LAUGHTER)But  if for some reason, Neil, he beats the rest of the field, I already know the Democrats are going to be bringing a suit. You have a big lawsuit over your head while youre running. And if you become the nominee, who the hell knows if you can even serve in office? So you should go out, get a declaratory judgment, let the courts decide. And you shouldnt have mentioned the polls because I would have been much...(CROSSTALK)CAVUTO: Why are you saying this now  right now? Why are you raising this issue now?TRUMP: Because now hes going a little bit better. No, I didnt care (inaudible). Its true. No, its true. Hey look, he never had a chance. Now, hes doing better. Hes got probably a four or five percent chance.(LAUGHTER)(CROSSTALK)CRUZ: Neil...(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: The fact is, there is a big overhang. Theres a big question mark on your head. And you cant do that to the party. You really cant. You cant do that to the party. You have to have certainty. Even if it was a one percent chance, and its far greater than one percent because (inaudible).I mean, you have great constitutional lawyers that say you cant run. If there was a  and you know Im not bringing a suit. I promise. But the Democrats are going to bring a lawsuit, and you have to have certainty. You cant have a question. I can agree with you or not, but you cant have a question over your head.CAVUTO: Senator, do you want to respond?CRUZ: Well, listen, Ive spent my entire life defending the Constitution before the U.S. Supreme Court. And Ill tell you, Im not going to be taking legal advice from Donald Trump.TRUMP: You dont have to. Take it from Lawrence Tribe.(APPLAUSE)(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: Take it from your professors...(CROSSTALK)CRUZ: The chances of any litigation proceeding and succeeding on this are zero. And Mr. Trump is very focused...TRUMP: Hes wrong. Hes wrong.CRUZ: ... on Larry Tribe. Let me tell you who Larry Tribe is. Hes a left-wing judicial activist, Harvard Law professor who was Al Gores lawyer in Bush versus Gore. Hes a major Hillary Clinton supporter. And theres a reason why Hillarys supporters are echoing Donalds attacks on me, because Hillary...TRUMP: He is not the only one.CRUZ: ... wants to face Donald Trump in the general election.TRUMP: There are many lawyers.CRUZ: And Ill tell you what, Donald, you  you very kindly just a moment ago offered me the V.P. slot.(LAUGHTER) Ill tell you what. If this all works out, Im happy to consider naming you as V.P. So if you happen to be right, you could get the top job at the end of the day.TRUMP: No  no...(LAUGHTER)... I think if it doesnt...(APPLAUSE)I like that. I like it. Id consider it. But I think Ill go back to building buildings if it doesnt work out.CRUZ: Actually, Id love to get you to build a wall.(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: I have a feeling its going to work out, actually.(CROSSTALK)RUBIO: Let me (inaudible). I was invoked in that question, so let me just say  in that answer  let me say, the real question here, I hate to interrupt this episode of Court TV.(LAUGHTER)But the real  but I think we have to get back to what this election has to be about. OK? Listen, we  this is the greatest country in the history of mankind. But in 2008, we elected a president that didnt want to fix America. He wants to change America. We elected a president that doesnt believe in the Constitution. He undermines it. We elected a president that is weakening America on the global stage. We elected a president that doesnt believe in the free enterprise system.This election has to be about reversing all of that damage. Thats why Im running for office because when I become president of the United States, on my first day in office we are going to repeal every single one of his unconstitutional executive orders. When Im president of the United States we are getting rid of Obamacare and we are rebuilding our military. And when Im president, were not just going to have a president that gives a State of the Union and says America is the greatest country in the world. When Im president, were going to have a president that acts like it.BARTIROMO: Thank you, senator.BARTIROMO: Mr. Trump, South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley in her response to the State of the Union address(APPLAUSE)BARITROMO: appeared to choose sides within the party, saying Republicans should resist, quote, the siren call of the angriest voices. She confirmed, she was referring to you among others. Was she out of line? And, how would a President Trump unite the party?TRUMP: Okay. First of all, Nikki this afternoon said Im a friend of hers. Actually a close friend. And wherever you are sitting Nikki, Im a friend. Were friends. Thats good.(LAUGHTER)But she did say there was anger. And I could say, oh, Im not angry. Im very angry because our country is being run horribly and I will gladly accept the mantle of anger. Our military is a disaster.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: Our healthcare is a horror show. Obamacare, were going to repeal it and replace it. We have no borders. Our vets are being treated horribly. Illegal immigration is beyond belief. Our country is being run by incompetent people. And yes, I am angry.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: And I wont be angry when we fix it, but until we fix it, Im very, very angry. And I say that to Nikki. So when Nikki said that, I wasnt offended. She said the truth.One of your colleagues interviewed me. And said, well, she said you were angry and I said to myself, huh, shes right. Im not fighting that. I didnt find it offensive at all. Im angry because our country is a mess.(APPLAUSE)BARITROMO: But what are you going to do about it?CAVUTO: Marco Rubio. Im sorry, its the time constraints. You and Governor Christie have been exchanging some fairly nasty words of late, and I will allow the governor to respond as well.The governor went so far to say, you wont be able to slime your way to the White House. Hes referring to a series of ads done by a PAC, speaking on your behalf, that say quote,One high tax, Common Core, liberal, energy-loving, Obamacare, Medicaid-expanding president is enough. You think you went too far on that and do you want to apologize to the governor?RUBIO: You know, as I said already twice in this debate, we have a very serious problem in this country.(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: We have a president of the United States that is undermining this countrys security and expanding the role of...CAVUTO: That is not my question.RUBIO: Well, I am going to answer your question, Neil. He is  this president is undermining the constitutional basis of this government. This president is undermining our military. He is undermining our standing in the world. I like Chris Christie, but we can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports Common Core.(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: We can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports gun control. This president, this president is more interested in funding  less interested in funding the military, than he is in funding planned  hes more interested in funding Planned Parenthood than he is in funding the military.Chris Christie wrote a check to Planned Parenthood. All Im saying is our next president has to be someone that undoes the damage Barack Obama has done to this country. It can not be someone that agrees with his agenda.Because the damage he has done to America is extraordinary. Let me tell you, if we dont get this election right, there may be no turning back for America. Were on the verge of being the first generation of Americans"
21,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/18/us/politics/transcript-of-the-democratic-presidential-debate.html,1/18/16,"Following is a transcript of the Democratic debate, as transcribed by the Federal News Service.HOLT: Good evening and welcome to the NBC News Youtube Democratic candidates debate. After all the campaigning, soon, Americans will have their say with the first votes of the 2016 campaign just 15 days away in Iowa.HOLT: And New Hampshire not far behind.Tonight will be the final opportunity to see these candidates face to face before the voting begins. Our purpose here tonight is to highlight and examine the differences among the three Democratic candidates. So lets get started.Please welcome Secretary Hillary Clinton, Senator Bernie Sanders and Governor Martin OMalley.(APPLAUSE)Well, welcome to all of you. Hope youre excited, were excited. We want to thank our hosts, the Congressional Black Caucus Institute. Im joined by my colleague Andrea Mitchell tonight. The rules are simple. Sixty seconds for answers, 30 seconds for follow-ups or rebuttals. I know youll all keep exactly to time, so our job should be pretty easy here tonight. Well have questions from the Youtube community throughout the debate.This is a critical point in the race. Youve been defining your differences with each other especially vigorously in the last week on the campaign trail. Were here to facilitate this conversation on behalf of the voters so that they know exactly where you stand as you face off tonight. Lets have a great debate.Well begin with 45 second opening statements from each candidate, starting with Secretary Clinton.CLINTON: Well, good evening. And I want to thank the Congressional Black Caucus Institute and the people of Charleston for hosting us here on the eve of Martin Luther King Day tomorrow.You know, I remember well when my youth minister took me to hear Dr. King. I was a teenager. And his moral clarity, the message that he conveyed that evening really stayed with me and helped to set me on a path to service. I also remember that he spent the last day of his life in Memphis, fighting for dignity and higher pay for working people.And that is our fight still. We have to get the economy working and incomes rising for everyone, including those who have been left out and left behind. We have to keep our communities and our country safe. We need a president who can do all aspects of the job.I understand that this is the hardest job in the world. Im prepared and ready to take it on and I hope to earn your support to be the nominee of the Democratic Party and the next president of the United States.(APPLAUSE)HOLT: Thank you. Senator Sanders, your opening statement, sir.SANDERS: Thank you. As we honor the extraordinary life of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., its important not only that we remember what he stood for, but that we pledge to continue his vision to transform our country. As we look out at our country today, what the American people understand is we have an economy thats rigged, that ordinary Americans are working longer hours for lower wages, 47 million people living in poverty, and almost all of the new income and wealth going to the top one percent.SANDERS: And then, to make a bad situation worse, we have a corrupt campaign finance system where millionaires and billionaires are spending extraordinary amounts of money to buy elections.This campaign is about a political revolution to not only elect the president, but to transform this country.HOLT: Senator, thank you.(APPLAUSE)And Governor OMalley, your opening statement, sir.OMALLEY: Thank you. My name is Martin OMalley, I was born the year Dr. King delivered his I Have A Dream speech.And I want to thank the people of South Carolina, not only for hosting our debate here tonight, but also for what you taught all of us in the aftermath of the tragic shooting at Mother Emanuel Church.You taught us, in fact, in keeping with Dr. Kings teaching, that love would have the final word when you took down the Confederate flag from your state house; let go of the past and move forward.Eight years ago, you brought forward a new leader in Barack Obama to save our country from the second Great Depression. And thats what hes done. Our countrys doing better, were creating jobs again.But in order to make good on the promise of equal opportunity and equal justice under the law, and we have urgent work to do, and the voices of anger and fear and division that weve heard coming off of the Republican presidential podiums are pretty loud.We need new leadership. We need to come together as a people and build on the good things that President Obama has done.Thats why Im running for president. I need your help, I ask for your vote, and I look forward to moving our country forward once again.Thank you.HOLT: All right. And Governor, thank you.(APPLAUSE)HOLT: All right, to our first question, now. The first question, Ill be addressing to all of the candidates.President Obama came to office determined to swing for the fences on health care reform. Voters want to know how you would define your presidency? How would you think big? So complete this sentence: in my first 100 days in office, my top three priorities will be  fill in the blank.Senator Sanders.SANDERS: Well, thats what our campaign is about. It is thinking big. It is understanding that in the wealthiest country in the history of the world, we should have health care for every man, woman, and child as a right that we should raise the minimum wage to at least $15 an hour; that we have got to create millions of decent- paying jobs by rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure.So, what my first days are about is bringing America together, to end the decline of the middle class, to tell the wealthiest people in this country that yes, they are going to start paying their fair share of taxes, and that we are going to have a government that works for all of us, and not just big campaign contributors.(APPLAUSE)HOLT: Secretary Clinton, same question, my first 100 days in office, my top three priorities will be.CLINTON: I would work quickly to present to the Congress my plans for creating more good jobs in manufacturing, infrastructure, clean and renewable energy, raising the minimum wage, and guaranteeing, finally, equal pay for womens work.I would also...(APPLAUSE)I would also be presenting my plans to build on the Affordable Care Act and to improve it by decreasing the out-of-pocket costs by putting a cap on prescription drug costs; by looking for ways that we can put the prescription drug business and the health insurance company business on a more stable platform that doesnt take too much money out of the pockets of hard-working Americans.And third, I would be working, in every way that I knew, to bring our country together. We do have too much division, too much mean- spiritedness. Theres a lot we have to do on immigration reform, on voting rights, on campaign finance reform, but we need to do it together. Thats how well have the kind of country for the 21st century that we know will guarantee our children and grandchildren the kind of future they deserve.(APPLAUSE)HOLT: Governor OMalley, same question.OMALLEY: Thank you. First of all, I would lay out an agenda to make wages go up again for all Americans, rather than down. Equal pay for equal work, making it easier rather than harder for people to join labor unions and bargain collectively for better wages; getting 11 million of our neighbors out of the underground shadow economy by passing comprehensive immigration reform, raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, however we can, wherever we can.Secondly, I believe the greatest business opportunity to come to the United States of America in 100 years is climate change. And I put forward a plan to move us to a 100 percent clean electric energy grid by 2050 and create 5 million jobs along the way.(APPLAUSE)HOLT: Thank you. Youve all...OMALLEY: Finally  Im sorry, that was second, Lester.OMALLEY: And third and finally, we need a new agenda for Americas cities. We have not had a new agenda for Americas cities since Jimmy Carter. We need a new agenda for America cities that will invest in the talents and skills in our people, that will invest in CBVG transportation, infrastructure and transit options, and make our cities the leading edge in this move to a redesigned built clean green energy future that will employ our people.HOLT: All right governor thank you.Weve all laid out large visions and were going to cover a lot of the ground you talked about as we continue in the evening. The last couple of weeks of this campaign have featured some of the sharpest exchanges in the race. Lets start with one of them, the issue of guns.Senator Sanders, last week Secretary Clinton called you quote, a pretty reliable vote for the gun lobby. Right before the debate you changed your position on immunity from lawsuits for gun manufacturers, can you tell us why?SANDERS: Well, I think Secretary Clinton knows that what she says is very disingenuous. I have a D-minus voting record from the NRA. I was in 1988, there were three candidates running for congress in the state of Vermont, I stood up to the gun lobby and came out and maintained the position that in this country we should not be selling military style assault weapons.I have supported from day one and instant background check to make certain that people who should have guns do not have guns. And that includes people of criminal backgrounds, people who are mentally unstable. I support what President Obama is doing in terms of trying to close the gun show loop holes and I think it should be a federal crime if people act as dormant (ph).We have seen in this city a horrendous tragedy of a crazed person praying with people in the coming up and shooting nine people. This should not be a political issue. What we should be doing is working together.And by the way, as a senator from a rural state that has virtually no gun control, I believe that I am in an excellent position to bring people together to fight the sensible...HOLT: Senator, but you didnt answer the question that you did change your position on immunity from gun manufacturers. So can you...SANDERS: What I have said, is that gun manufacturers liability bill has some good provisions among other things, weve prohibited ammunition that wouldve killed cops who had protection on. We have child safety protection work on guns in that legislation. And what we also said, is a small mom and pop gun shop who sells a gun legally to somebody should not be held liable if somebody does something terrible with that gun.So what I said is,  I would re-look at it. We are going to re- look at it and I will support stronger provisions.HOLT: Secretary Clinton, would you like to respond to Senator Sanders.CLINTON: Yes look, I have made it clear based on Senator Sanders own record that he has voted with the NRA, with the gun lobby numerous times. He voted against the Brady Bill five times. He voted for what we call, the Charleston Loophole. He voted for immunity from gunmakers and sellers which the NRA said, was the most important piece of gun legislation in 20 years. He voted to let guns go onto the Amtrak, guns go into National Parks. He voted against doing research to figure out how we can save lives. Lets not forget what this is about, 90 people a day die from gun violence in our country. Thats 33,000 people a year.One of the most horrific examples not a block from here where we had nine people murdered. Now, I am pleased to hear that Senator Sanders has reversed his position on immunity and I look forward to him joining with those members of congress who have already introduced legislation. There is no other industry in America that was given the total pass that the gun makers and dealers were and that needs to be reversed.HOLT: All right, Governor OMalley, you signed tough gun control measures as governor of Maryland and there are a lot Democrats in the audience here in South Carolina who own guns. This conversation might be worrying many of them. They may be hearing, you want to take my guns. What would you say to them?OMALLEY: This is what I would say Lester, look see, Ive listened to Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders go back and forth on which of them has the most inconsistent record on gun safety legislation and I would have to agree with both of them. Theyve both been inconsistent when it comes to this issue.OMALLEY: Im the one candidate on this stage that actually brought people together to pass comprehensive gun safety legislation. This is very personal to me being from Baltimore. I will never forget one occasion visiting a little boy in Johns Hopkins Hospital, he was getting a birthday haircut, the age of three when drug dealers turned that barbershop into a shooting gallery and that boys head was pierced with a bullet. And I remember visiting him, it did not kill him - I remember visiting him and his mother in Johns Hopkins Hospital. He was getting a birthday haircut, the age of three when drug dealers turned that barbershop into a shooting gallery, and that boys head was pierced with a bullet.And, I remember visiting him, it did not kill him. I remember visiting him and his mother in Johns Hopkins Hospital. In his diapers (ph) with tubes running in and out of his head, same age as my little boy.So, after the slaughter of the kids in Connecticut last year, we brought people together. We did pass in our state comprehensive gun safety legislation. It did have a ban on combat assault weapons, universal background checks, and you know what? We did not interrupt a single persons hunting season.Ive never met a self respecting deer hunter that needed an AR-15 to down a deer. And, so...(APPLAUSE)... were able to actually do these things.HOLT: Alright, Governor, thank you.Secretary Clinton, this is a community that has suffered a lot of heartache in the last year. Of course, as you mentioned, the church shootings. We wont forget the video of Walter Scott being shot in the back while running from police.We understand that a jury will decide whether that police officer was justified, but it plays straight to the fears of many African American men that their lives are cheap. Is that perception, or in your view, is it reality?CLINTON: Well, sadly its reality, and it has been heartbreaking, and incredibly outraging to see the constant stories of young men like Walter Scott, as you said, who have been killed by police officers. Their needs to be a concerted effort to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system.And, that requires a very clear, agenda for retraining police officers, looking at ways to end racial profiling, finding more ways to really bring the disparities that stalk our country into high relief.One out of three African American men may well end up going to prison. Thats the statistic. I want people hear to think what we would be doing if it was one out of three white men, and very often, the black men are arrested, convicted and incarcerated ...(APPLAUSE)...for offensive that do not lead to the same results for white men.So, we have a very serious problem that we can no longer ignore.HOLT: You time is up.Senator Sanders, my next question is...SANDERS: ...Well, I  look...HOLT: ... Its actually  actually my next question is to you...SANDERS: ... Let me respond to what the secretary said. We have a criminal justice system which is broken. Who in America is satisfied that we have more people in jail than any other country on Earth, including China? Disproportionately African American, and Latino. Who is satisfied that 51% of African American young people are either unemployed, or underemployed? Who is satisfied that millions of people have police records for possessing marijuana when the CEOs of Wall Street companies who destroyed our economy have no police records.(APPLAUSE)HOLT: Senator Sanders...SANDERS: ... We need to take a very hard look at our...HOLT: Senator. Senator Sanders...SANDERS: ... criminal justice system, investing in jobs, and education not in jails and incarceration .HOLT: ... Just over a week ago the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus endorsed Secretary Clinton, not you. He said that choosing her over you was not a hard decision. In fact, our polling shows shes beating you more than two to one among minority voters. How can you be the nominee if you dont have that support?SANDERS: Well, let me talk about polling.(LAUGHTER) SANDERS: As Secretary Clinton well knows, when this campaign began she was 50 points ahead of me. We were all of three percentage points. Guess what?In Iowa, New Hampshire, the race is very, very close. Maybe were ahead New Hampshire.(CHEERING)SANDERS: In terms of polling, guess what? We are running ahead of Secretary Clinton. In terms of taking on my taking on my good friend, Donald Trump, beating him by 19 points in New Hampshire, 13 points in the last national poll that we saw.To answer your question. When the African American community becomes familiar with my Congressional record and with our agenda, and with our views on the economy, and criminal justice  just as the general population has become more supportive, so will the African American community, so will the Latino community. We have the momentum, were on a path to a victory.(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)OMALLEY: Lester, I (inaudible)HOLT: Governor, Im going to come to you in a second.Google searches for the words, Black Lives Matter surpassed, civil rights movement. And, here in South Carolina, black lives matter was the number one trending political issue.HOLT: Governor OMalley, youve campaigned on your record as governor of Maryland, and before that, the mayor of Baltimore. Last year, of course, Baltimore was rocked by violent unrest in the wake of the death of Freddie Gray.And right from the start of your campaign, youve been dogged by those who blame your tough-on-crime, so-called zero tolerance policies as mayor for contributing to that unrest. What responsibility do you bear?OMALLEY: Yes, lets talk about this. When I ran for mayor in 1999, Lester, it was not because our city was doing well. It was because we were burying over 300 young, poor black men every single year.And thats why I ran, because, yes, black lives matter. And we did a number of things. We werent able to make our city immune from setbacks as the Freddie Gray unrest and tragic death showed.But we were able to save a lot of lives doing things that actually worked to improve police and community relations. The truth of the matter is, we created a civilian review board. And many of these things are in the new agenda for criminal justice reform that Ive put forward.We created a civilian review board, gave them their own detectives. We required the reporting of discourtesy, use of excessive force, lethal force. I repealed the possession of marijuana as a crime in our state.I drove our incarceration rate down to 20-year lows, and drove violent crime down to 30-year lows, and became the first governor south of the Mason-Dixon line to repeal the death penalty.I feel a responsibility every day to find things that work...(APPLAUSE)HOLT: All right. Lets talk...OMALLEY: ... and to do more of them to reform our criminal justice system.HOLT: Lets talk more about policing and the criminal justice system. Senator Sanders, a few times tonight were going to hear from some of the most prominent voices on YouTube, starting with Franchesca Ramsey, who tackles racial stereotypes through her videos. Lets watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)FRANCHESCA RAMSEY: Hey, Im Franchesca Ramsey. I believe theres a huge conflict of interest when local prosecutors investigate cases of police violence within their own communities.For example, last month, the officers involved in the case of 12- year-old Tamir Rice werent indicted. How would your presidency ensure that incidents of police violence are investigated and prosecuted fairly?(END VIDEO CLIP)HOLT: Senator Sanders.SANDERS: I apologize for not hearing all of that question.HOLT: Would you like me to read it back to you?SANDERS: Yes.HOLT: Prosecutors  I believe theres a huge conflict of interest when local prosecutors investigate cases of police violence within their communities. Most recently, we saw this with a non- indictment of the officers involved in the case of 12-year-old Tamir Rice. How would you presidency ensure incidents of police violence are investigated and prosecuted fairly?SANDERS: Absolutely. This is a responsibility for the U.S. Justice Department to get involved. Whenever anybody in this country is killed while in police custody, it should automatically trigger a U.S. attorney generals investigation.(APPLAUSE)Second of all, and I speak as a mayor who worked very closely and well with police officers, the vast majority of whom are honest, hard- working people trying to do a difficult job, but let us be clear.If a police officer breaks the law, like any public official, that officer must be held accountable.(APPLAUSE)And thirdly, we have got to de-militarize our police departments so they dont look like occupying armies. Weve got to move toward community policing.And fourthly, we have got to make our police departments look like the communities they serve in their diversity.(APPLAUSE)HOLT: Secretary Clinton, this question is for you. Tonight parts of America are in the grip of a deadly heroin epidemic, spanning race and class, hitting small towns and cities alike. It has become a major issue in this race.In a lot of places where youve been campaigning, despite an estimated trillion dollars spent, many say the war on drugs has failed. So what would you do?CLINTON: Well, Lester, youre right. Everywhere I go to campaign, Im meeting families who are affected by the drug problem that mostly is opioids and heroin now, and lives are being lost and children are being orphaned. And Ive met a lot of grandparents who are now taking care of grandchildren.So I have tried to come out with a comprehensive approach that, number one, does tell the states that we will work with you from the federal government putting more money, about a billion dollars a year, to help states have a different approach to dealing with this epidemic.The policing needs to change. Police officers must be equipped with the antidote to a heroin overdose or an opioid overdose, known as Narcan. They should be able to administer it. So should firefighters and others.We have to move away from treating the use of drugs as a crime and instead, move it to where it belongs, as a health issue. And we need to divert more people from the criminal justice system into drug courts, into treatment, and recovery.HOLT: And thats time. CLINTON: So this is the kind of approach that we should take in dealing with what is now...HOLT: Senator...CLINTON: ... a growing epidemic.HOLT: Senator Sanders, would you like to respond?SANDERS: Sure. I agree...(APPLAUSE)I agree with everything the Secretary said, but let me just add this, there is a responsibility on the part of the pharmaceutical industry and the drug companies who are producing all of these drugs and not looking at the consequence of it.And second of all, when we talk about addiction being a disease, the Secretary is right, what that means is we need a revolution in this country in terms of mental health treatment. People should be able to get the treatment that they need when they need it, not two months from now, which is why I believe in universal...HOLT: Thats...SANDERS: ... healthcare with mental health...HOLT: ... time.SANDERS: ... a part of that.HOLT: Were going to get into all that coming up.OMALLEY (?): Lester, just ten seconds.HOLT: But were going to take a break and we need to take a break...OMALLEY (?): Just 10 seconds. All of the things...HOLT: ... and when we come back, the anger brewing in America.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HOLT: Welcome back to Charleston. Lets turn to another area where there has been fierce disagreement  that would be health care.Senator Sanders and Secretary Clinton, you both mentioned it in your 100-day priorities.Lets turn to my colleague, Andrea Mitchell now to lead that questioning.MITCHELL: Thank you, Lester.Secretary Clinton, Senator Sanders favors what he calls Medicare for all. Now, you said that what he is proposing would tear up Obamacare and replace it.Secretary Clinton, is it fair to say to say that Bernie Sanders wants to kill Obamacare?CLINTON: Well, Andrea, I am absolutely committed to universal health care. I have worked on this for a long time, people may remember that I took on the health insurance industry back in the 90s, and I didnt quit until we got the childrens health insurance program that ensures eight million kids.And I certainly respect Senator Sanders intentions, but when youre talking about health care, the details really matter. And therefore, we have been raising questions about the nine bills that he introduced over 20 years, as to how they would work and what would be the impact on peoples health care?He didnt like that, his campaign didnt like it either. And tonight, hes come out with a new health care plan. And again, we need to get into the details. But heres what I believe, the Democratic Party and the United States worked since Harry Truman to get the Affordable Care Act passed.We finally have a path to universal health care. We have accomplished so much already. I do not to want see the Republicans repeal it, and I dont to want see us start over again with a contentious debate. I want us to defend and build on the Affordable Care Act and improve it.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: OK.MITCHELL: Senator Sanders?SANDERS: Secretary  Secretary Clinton didnt answer your question.(LAUGHTER)Because what her campaign was saying  Bernie Sanders, who has fought for universal health care for my entire life, he wants to end Medicare, end Medicaid, end the childrens health insurance program. That is nonsense.What a Medicare-for-all program does is finally provide in this country health care for every man, woman and child as a right. Now, the truth is, that Frank Delano Roosevelt, Harry Truman, do you know what they believed in? They believed that health care should be available to all of our people.Im on the committee that wrote the Affordable Care Act. I made the Affordable Care Act along with Jim Clyburn a better piece of legislation. I voted for it, but right now, what we have to deal with is the fact that 29 million people still have no health insurance. We are paying the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs, getting ripped off.And heres the important point, we are spending far more per person on health care than the people of any other country. My proposal, provide health care to all people, get private insurance out of health insurance, lower the cost of health care for middle class families by 5,000 bucks.Thats the vision we need to take.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: But  Senator Sanders, if I can...(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: You know, I have to say Im not sure whether were talking about the plan you just introduced tonight, or were talking about the plan you introduced nine times in the Congress. But the fact is, we have the Affordable Care Act. That is one of the greatest accomplishments of President Obama, of the Democratic Party, and of our country.(APPLAUSE)And we have already seen 19 million Americans get insurance. We have seen the end of pre-existing conditions keeping people from getting insurance.(APPLAUSE)We have seen women no longer paying more for our insurance than men. And we have seen young people, up to the age of 26, being able to stay on their parents policy.SANDERS: But  what if we have...CLINTON: Now, there are things we can do to improve it, but to tear it up and start over again, pushing our country back into that kind of a contentious debate, I think is the wrong direction.SANDERS: It is  it is absolutely inaccurate.OMALLEY: I have to talk about something thats actually working in our state.MITCHELL: Governor  Governor Sanders...SANDERS: No one is tearing this up, were going to go forward. But with the secretary neglected to mention, not just the 29 million still have no health insurance, that even more are underinsured with huge copayments and deductibles.Tell me why we are spending almost three times more than the British, who guarantee health care to all of their people? Fifty percent more than the French, more than the Canadians. The vision from FDR and Harry Truman was health care for all people as a right in a cost-effective way.Were not going to tear up the Affordable Care Act. I helped write it. But we are going to move on top of that to a Medicaid-for- all system.OMALLEY: Andrea  Andrea  Andrea.(CROSSTALK)(APPLAUSE)OMALLEY: Instead of  Andrea, I think, instead of attacking one another on health care, we should be talking about the things that are actually working.In our state, we have moved to an all-payer system. With the Affordable Care Act, we now have moved all of our acute care hospitals, that driver of cost at the center, away from fee-for- service.And actually to pay, we pay them based on how well they keep patients out of the hospital. How well they keep their patients. Thats the future. We need to build on the Affordable Care Act, do the things that work, and reduce costs and increase access.(CROSSTALK)CLINTON: And thats exactly what we are able to do based on the foundation of the Affordable Care Act  what Governor OMalley just said is one of the models that we will be looking at to make sure we do get costs down, we do limit a lot of the unnecessary costs that we still have in the system.But, with all due respect, to start over again with a whole new debate is something that I think would set us back. The Republicans just voted last week to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and thank goodness, President Obama vetoed it and saved Obamacare for the American people.(APPLAUSE)MITCHELL: Senator Sanders, let me ask you this, though...SANDERS: Yeah.MITCHELL: ... youve talked about Medicare for all...SANDERS: Yes.MITCHELL: .. and tonight youve released a very detailed plan, just two... SANDERS: Not all that detailed.MITCHELL: ... well, two hours before the debate, you did.SANDERS: Well.MITCHELL: But let me ask you about Vermont. Because in Vermont  you tried in the state of Vermont, and Vermont walked away from this kind of idea, of  of Medicare for all, single-payer, because they concluded it would require major tax increases...SANDERS: Well, thats  you might want to ask...MITCHELL: ... and by some estimates, it would double the budget. If you couldnt sell it in Vermont, Senator...SANDERS: Andrea, let me just say this.MITCHELL: ... how can you sell it to the country?SANDERS: Let me just say that you might want to ask the governor of the state of Vermont why he could not do it. Im not the governor. Im the senator from the state of Vermont.(LAUGHTER)But second of all  second of all...(APPLAUSE)... here is what the real point is, in terms of all of the issues youve raised  the good questions youve raised. You know what it all comes down to?Do you know why we cant do what every other country  major country on Earth is doing? Its because we have a campaign finance system that is corrupt, we have super PACs, we have the pharmaceutical industry pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into campaign contributions and lobbying, and the private insurance companies as well.What this is really about is not the rational way to go forward  its Medicare for all  it is whether we have the guts to stand up to the private insurance companies and all of their money, and the pharmaceutical industry.

22,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/29/us/politics/republican-presidential-debate-transcript.html,1/29/16,"Following is a transcript of the main Republican debate, as transcribed by the Federal News Service.BRET BAIER: Nine p.m. on the East Coast. Eight oclock here in Des Moines, Iowa. Welcome to the seventh Republican presidential debate of the 2016 campaign. Im Bret Baier, along with my comoderators Megyn Kelly and Chris Wallace. KELLY: Tonight, we are coming to you live from the Iowa Event Center in downtown Des Moines, in the shadow of the Iowa state capitol. In just four days, people here in the Hawkeye State will caucus and cast the first votes of the 2016 election.CHRIS WALLACE: Tonight, were partnering with Google for an exclusive second-screen experience. Search Fox News debate on Google any time in the next two hours to access exclusive content.You can see the campaigns respond to the debate in real time, and you can weigh in by voting on the topics being discussed. Just go to google.com or open your Google search app and type in Fox News debate.BAIER: Google sees political searches spike during televised presidential debates  no surprise there. But they spike by more than 440 percent on average, as voters across America seek to learn more about whats happening on the live debate stage.MEGYN KELLY: Seven candidates are on that stage tonight, their position on the stage determined by their standing in the latest national polls, as well as polls in Iowa and New Hampshire. And here they are.Texas Senator Ted Cruz.(APPLAUSE)Florida Senator Marco Rubio.(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Neurosurgeon Dr. Ben Carson.(APPLAUSE)Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush.(APPLAUSE)New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Ohio Governor John Kasich.(APPLAUSE) And Kentucky Senator Rand Paul.(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Apparently Iowas near Kentucky.BAIER: Tonights rules are simple. Up to 60 seconds for each answer, 30 seconds for each follow-up response. And if a candidate goes over the allotted time, you will hear this.(BELL RINGS)Double.KELLY: Wow.BAIER: I think the double is the one we want. Very pleasing.(LAUGHTER)We have a crowd of about 1,600 here, and while they have agreed to respect the candidates and listen intently, we can tell you they are very excited to be here. Am I right?(APPLAUSE)KELLY: So lets get started.Senator Cruz, before we get to the issues, lets address the elephant not in the room tonight.(LAUGHTER)Donald Trump has chosen not to attend this evenings presidential debate. What message do you think that sends to the voters of Iowa?CRUZ: Well, Megyn, let me say at the outset to the men and women of Iowa, thank you for the incredible hospitality over this past year.By Monday, you will have welcomed me into all 99 counties in Iowa. You will have welcomed my dad to preach at your churches. You will have welcomed Heidi and our girls, Caroline and Catherine, into your homes. And Im so grateful for the diligence, for the seriousness with which the men and women of Iowa approach this process.If I am elected president, keep an eye on the tarmac, because Ill be back, because Iowa in 2017 will not be fly-over country. It will be fly-to country.(APPLAUSE)Now, secondly, let me say Im a maniac and everyone on this stage is stupid, fat, and ugly. And Ben, youre a terrible surgeon.(LAUGHTER) Now that weve gotten the Donald Trump portion out of the way...(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)I want to thank everyone here for showing the men and women of Iowa the respect to show up and make the case to the people of this state and the people of the country why each of us believe we would make the best commander in chief.(APPLAUSE)KELLY: The divide between you and Mr. Trump has turned into one of the biggest stories in the country. And for six months that  your campaign, during this campaign, you praised Mr. Trump as somebody who you thought was an effective voice against the Washington cartel. You said you were glad that he was running as a Republican.But when he started to criticize you, your message changed, and you suddenly started to portray him as the voice of the Washington cartel, and suggested he would do the Democrats bidding. Which is it?CRUZ: Well, let me be clear, if Donald engages in insults or anybody else, I dont intend to reciprocate. I have not insulted Donald personally and I dont intend to.I am glad Donald is running. Im glad he has produced enormous enthusiasm, and, every Donald Trump voter or potential voter, I hope to earn your support. I know everyone else on this stage hopes to earn your support.Now, there is a difference between personal insults and attacks  between going into the mud with ad hominems and focusing on issues and substance. CRUZ: I think issues and substance, policy and vision and record should be the meat of politics. Thats fair game but thats where Im going to focus. Thats how I focused from the beginning of the campaign and it is how I intend to continue going forward.(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Senator Rubio, I want to explore this sort of larger issue. The campaign has in a sense turned into a battle for the soul of the Republican party: establishment versus grassroots, pragmatic versus principle. You say that you can unite all of the factions inside the GOP. How?RUBIO: Chris, lets begin by being clear what this campaign is about. Its not about Donald Trump. Hes an entertaining guy. Hes the greatest show on earth. This campaign is about the greatest country in the world and a president who has systematically destroyed many of the things that made America special.You see, we usually elect presidents in America that want to change the things that are wrong in America. Barack Obama wants to change America. Barack Obama wants America to be more like the rest of the world. We dont want to be like the rest of the world. We want to be the United States of America.(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: That is why Hillary Clinton cannot win this election. Hillary Clinton this week said Barack Obama would make a great Supreme Court justice. The guy who systematically and habitually violates the constitution on the Supreme Court? I dont think so. If Im our nominee, I will unite this party and well defeat Hillary Clinton and we will turn this country around once and for all, after seven years of the disaster that is Barack Obama.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Governor Bush, its hard for anyone of your pedigree to avoid being called establishment. But isnt that part of the problem in this race, that three others on this stage are splitting the main stream Republican vote and there by possibly handing this nomination over to an anti-establishment candidate?BUSH: Bret, were just starting. The first vote hasnt been counted. Why dont we let the process work. I trust Iowans, Granite staters (ph), people in South Carolina, people in Nevada, to start this process out. I kind of miss Donald Trump. He was a little teddy bear to me.(LAUGHTER)We always had such a loving relationship in these debates and in between and the tweets. I kind of miss him. I wish he was here. Everybody else was in the witness protection program when I went after him on behalf of what the Republican cause should be: conservative principles, believing in limited government, believing in accountability. Leading by fixing the things that are broken.Look, I am in the establishment because my dad, the greatest man alive was president of the United States and my brother, who I adore as well as fantastic brother was president. Fine, Ill take it. I guess Im part of the establishment Barbara Bush is my mom. Ill take that, too.(APPLAUSE)BUSH: But this election is not about our pedigree, this is an election about people that are really hurting. We need a leader that will fix things and have a proven record to do it. And we need someone who will take on Hillary Clinton in November. Someone who has a proven record, who has been tested, who is totally transparent. I released 34 years of tax returns...(BELL RINGS)... and 300,000 e-mails in my government record. To get the information from Hillary Clinton, you need to get a subpoena from the FBI.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Thank you governor.KELLY: Senator Christie, you began this campaign touting your record as a Republican from a blue state who knows how to get things done and reach across the aisle. However, many Republicans feel that reaching across the aisle and getting things done isnt great if you get the wrong things done. And they prefer to stand on principle rather than compromise. Why are they wrong and youre right?CHRISTIE: Theyre not wrong. But whats wrong is your premise in the question. You can do both. There is no reason why you cant stand for principles, go and fight for them and be able also, to have to get things done in government.You know, what people are frustrated about in Washington, D.C.., and I know the folks out there tonight are incredibly frustrated because what they see is a government that doesnt work for them. You know, for the 45-year-old construction worker out there, who is having a hard time making things meet.Hes lost $4,000 in the last seven years in his income because of this administration. He doesnt want to hear the talk about politics Megyn and who is establishment and who is grassroots. And whos compromised and who is principled. What he wants is something to get done.And thats the difference between being a governor and having done that for the last six years in New Jersey and being someone who has never had to be responsible for any of those decisions. Barack Obama was never responsible for those decisions.Hillary Clinton has never been responsible for those kind of decisions where they were held accountable. Ive been held accountable for six years as the governor of New Jersey and with a Democratic legislature, Ive gotten conservative things done. Thats exactly what Ill do as president of the United States.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Senator Paul, you are definitely not in the establishment category. But at the beginning of this campaign, you said you were your own man when asked about your father, former Texas Congressman and three-time presidential candidate Ron Paul.Senator Cruzs campaign is out with a video saying that Cruz is the intellectual and political heir to your fathers 2012 campaign and the liberty movement. And your father now says its realistic that Donald Trump will be your partys nominee.So did you make a mistake by not fully  more fully embracing your father politically at the beginning of this campaign?PAUL: You know, Ive always had a great deal of respect. Theres probably no person I respect more in the country or in recent history than my father. I think he was probably the most honest man in politics that weve ever seen in a generation.And so in no way have I ever said that I dont embrace my father or love my father or appreciate everything that he has done for the country. I think whats interesting about where that liberty vote goes that my father brought to the Republican Party is, I dont think theyre necessarily going to go for Ted.You know, Ted didnt show up. We had an audit-the-Fed vote, which was the biggest thing my dad had been advocating for, for 30 years, Ted didnt have time to show up. He was the only Republican that didnt show up for it.And so I think really that vote is going to stay in the Paul household. I think more of it is coming and its going to grow.The NSA is another big issue. Ted said he was for NSA reform, but then he told Marco Rubio, no, no, no, I voted for the bill because Im for the government collecting 100 percent of your cell phone records.I dont think Ted can have it both ways. They want to say theyre getting some of the liberty vote. But we dont see it happening at all. We think were going to do very well in Iowa with the liberty vote.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Senator Cruz, your response to that?CRUZ: Well, I agree with Rand that I very much respect Ron Paul and that I think anyone who is able to win in the Republican Party has to be able to bring together the disparate elements of the Reagan coalition. Youve got to be able to bring together conservatives and evangelicals and libertarians, and stitch together a winning majority.When it comes to the audit the Fed bill, as Rand knows well, I was an original sponsor of the bill, Im strongly supportive of it. It didnt have the votes to pass. And I had commitments to be at a town hall in New Hampshire.But I look forward to signing that bill into law as president and auditing the Fed and providing needed accountability at the Federal Reserve.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Senator Rubio?RUBIO: I think, you know, Rand and I have some significant issues on policy, but I respect Rand. He believes everything he stands for.(APPLAUSE)I do respect Rand.But I want to be frank about what I stand for. I believe the world is a safer and a better place when America is the strongest power in the world. And I believe only with a strong America will we defeat this radical group, this apocalyptic group called ISIS.Thats why when Im president we are going to rebuild our intelligence capabilities. And theyre going to tell us where the terrorists are. And a rebuilt U.S. military is going to destroy these terrorists.And if we capture any of these ISIS killers alive, they are going to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and were going to find out everything they know, because when Im president, unlike Barack Obama, we will keep this country safe.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Thank you, Senator.PAUL: May I respond?(CROSSTALK)BAIER: Well come back to...PAUL: Well, I mean, I was talked about in the question.BAIER: OK. Go ahead, go ahead. PAUL: Just very quickly, I would like to respond.The bulk collection of your phone data, the invasion of your privacy did not stop one terrorist attack. I dont think you have to give up your liberty for a false sense of security.When we look at this bulk collection, the court has looked at this. Even the court declared it to be illegal. If we want to collect the records of terrorists, lets do it the old fashioned way. Lets use the Fourth Amendment. Lets put a name on a warrant, lets ask a judge for it. Lets respect the history of our country.John Adams said that we fought a War for Independence because we wanted to fight against generalized warrants. Lets dont forget that.(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Governor Kasich, I want to get back to this question of where conservatives are this year. You call yourself a, quote, inside-outside guy, a reformer who knows how to get things done, but you reject the establishment label.First question is why do you reject it? And secondly, what do you say to Republican voters this year who view practical government experience as a liability and not an asset?KASICH: Well, first of all, I had a national reporter say, you know, theres three lanes. Theres the establishment lane, the anti- establishment lane, and then theres the Kasich lane.And the reason is, is that Ive been a reformer all of my career, fighting to reform welfare, fighting to reform the Pentagon, also being in a position to balance the budget, because that is very, very hard to do.And then in Ohio, of course, I had to bring about big reform, again, because we were so far in the hole and now we just found out we are up over 400,000 jobs since I took over as governor.KASICH: You know, the situation is this. We cannot fix things in this country  the Social Security, the border, balancing the budget, getting wages to grow faster  unless we lead as conservatives, but we also invite people in from the other party. We have to come together as a country. And we have to stop all the divisions.And, you know, thats been my message in New Hampshire. And having been in New Hampshire and here in Iowa, but in New Hampshire, I just received the support of seven out of eight of the newspapers in that state because they see positive, they see unity, they see coming together, and they see a record of change and a record of accomplishment.And it isnt because Im all that great. Its because Ive been assembling a team of people who want to be involved in something thats a little bigger than themselves. Ill keep  Ill keep heading in that direction, believe me.(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Dr. Carson, I want to pick up on that with you. Governor Kasich likes to say he knows how to land the plane. Youve landed a lot of planes in the O.R. But what about the idea of running for president with no experience in government at all?CARSON: Well, I will gladly confess that Im the only one on this stage with no political title. Youre not going to hear a lot of polished political speech from me, but you will hear the truth. And I dont think you have to be a politician to tell the truth. In fact, sometimes its not that way...(APPLAUSE)... and Ive had more two a.m. phone calls than everybody here put together, making life and death decisions, put together very complex teams to accomplish things that have never been done before. And we are in a situation right now in our country that we have never been in before. We need people who think out of the box and can solve problems; can utilize the resources around them; very smart people, to focus on the problem and solve the problem.The American people are terrified. Thats why we have this abnormal situation going on right now. We dont need more of the same solutions. We need different solutions to solve the problems and to save our nation. (APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Gentlemen, were now going to start to drill down into specific issues that are on voters minds. Im going to start with one of the biggest ones, which is foreign terror.According to Google, ISIS was by far the most searched foreign policy topic over the last year. Senator Cruz, you talk tough about fighting terrorism. You talk about carpet bombing into oblivion. You talk about seeing if the sand will glow at night. But critics say that your record does not match up to that. You opposed giving President Obama authority to enforce his red line in Syria. Three years in a row now, you have voted against the Defense Authorization Act.How do you square your rhetoric with your record, sir?CRUZ: Well, Chris, I will apologize to nobody for the vigorousness with which I will fight terrorism, go after ISIS, hunt them down wherever they are, and utterly and completely destroy ISIS.(APPLAUSE)You know, you claim it is tough talk to discuss carpet bombing. It is not tough talk. It is a different, fundamental military strategy than what weve seen from Barack Obama. Barack Obama right now, number one, over seven years, has dramatically degraded our military. You know, just two weeks ago was the 25th anniversary of the first Persian Gulf war. When that war began, we had 8,000 planes. Today, we have about 4,000. When that war began, we had 529 ships. Today, we have 272.You want to know what carpet bombing is? Its what we did in the first Persian Gulf war; 1,100 air attacks a day, saturation bombing that utterly destroyed the enemy. Right now, Barack Obama is launching between 15 and 30 air attacks a day. Hes not arming the Kurds. We need to define the enemy. We need to rebuild the military to defeat the enemy. And we need to be focused and lift the rules of engagement so were not sending our fighting men and women into combat with their arms tied behind their backs.(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Senator Rubio, does Senator Cruzs record match his rhetoric?RUBIO: Well, again, I mean, obviously, as already has been pointed out, the only budget that Ted has ever voted for is a budget that Rand Paul sponsored that brags about cutting defense spending. And I think thats a bad idea for the following reason.ISIS is the most dangerous jihadist group in the history of mankind. ISIS is now found in affiliates in over a dozen countries. ISIS is a group that burns people alive in cages; that sells off little girls as brides. ISIS is a group that wants to trigger an apocalyptic showdown in the city of Dabiq  not the city of Dubuque; I mis-said  mis-said that wrong once (inaudible) time  the city of Dabiq in Syria. They want to trigger an apocalyptic Armageddon showdown.RUBIO: This group needs to be confronted and defeated. They are not going to go away on their own. Theyre not going to turn into stockbrokers overnight or open up a chain of car washes. They need to be defeated militarily, and that will take overwhelming U.S. force.Today, we are on pace to have the smallest Army since the end of World War II, the smallest Navy in 100 years, the smallest Air Force in our history. You cannot destroy ISIS with a military thats being diminished. When Im president, we are rebuilding the U.S. military because the world is a safer and a better place when America is the strongest military in the world.(CROSSTALK)WALLACE: Senator Cruz, youve got 30 seconds. You were mentioned.(APPLAUSE)CRUZ: Chris, in 1981, when Ronald Reagan came to the Oval Office, he encountered a military that had been debilitated just as the current military has, just like Jimmy Carter weakened our readiness, undermined our ability to defend this country, so too has Barack Obama. Just as morale in the military has plummeted in the last seven, so it had then.What Reagan did is he began with tax reform and regulatory reform, unleashing the engine of the American free enterprise system. It brought booming economic growth and that growth fueled rebuilding the military. I intend to do the exact same thing to defeat radical Islamic terrorism WALLACE: Gentlemen.CRUZ: ... and to devote the resources from the booming economy to rebuilding our Navy, rebuilding our Air Force, rebuilding our Army and ensuring we have the capacity to keep this country safe.PAUL: My budget was mentioned. My budget was mentioned.WALLACE: May I  may I just say, we are going to continue the questions about foreign terror, gentlemen, right after this break.KELLY: But first, you can join tonights conversation right from home. Go to google.com or open your Google search app and search Fox News debate to vote on which candidate you think has the best plan to defeat ISIS. Well be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER: Welcome back. Lets get right back to the questions. Chris.WALLACE: Thank you. Governor Christie, you have compared both Senators Cruz and Rubio to Barack Obama, saying that we cannot afford another inexperienced President. Youve also said that Senator Cruzs vote to curtail the NSA surveillance program made America less safe. Is either of them ready to be Commander in Chief?CHRISTIE: Well, let me say that I do believe that the vote on NSA made the country less safe. Well, let me tell you what the country should really be worried about. I watched that town hall meeting with the Democrats the other night, and I heard Hillary Clinton asked a direct question by an Iowan, and thats what Iowans like to do. They like to ask direct questions.And, they asked about her email situation. And, heres what she said to the American people. She did it for convenience. For her convenience. She put Americas secrets at risk for her convenience. She put American intelligence officers at risk for her convenience. She put American strategy at risk for her convenience.Let me tell you whos not qualified to be President of the United States, Chris. Hillary Rodham Clinton did that to our country. She is not qualified to be President of the United States.(CHEERING)The fact is what we need is someone on that stage who has been tested, who has been through it, who has made decisions, who has sit (ph) in the chair of consequence and can prosecute the case against Hillary Clinton on...(BELL RINGING)CHRISTIE: ... that stage, and that is exactly what I am ready to do.(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Governor Bush...CRUZ: Chris? Chris I was mentioned in that question.BUSH: No, you werent. Your name wasnt mentioned, Ted.CRUZ: ... Actually, I was...BUSH: ... Chris, keep it coming...WALLACE: ... I dont think that your name was mentioned...CRUZ: ... Chris, your questions that you...WALLACE: ... Sir, I think  I think the question was...CRUZ: ... What was your question...WALLACE: ... Its not my question that you get a chance to respond to, its his answer.(LAUGHTER)WALLACE: You dont get 30 seconds to respond to me...CRUZ: ... Your question was you have disagreed...(AUDIENCE REACTION)WALLACE: ... You dont get 30 seconds to respond to me...CRUZ: ... (inaudible) opening statement.WALLACE: ... If I could go on. Sir, I know you like to argue about the rules, but were going to conduct a debate...BUSH: ... Thank you Chris...WALLACE: ... Governor Bush...CRUZ: ... This entire question was an attack, but thats (inaudible)WALLACE: Governor Bush, heres the question  Im going to ask Governor Bush the question.You criticized several candidates in this field on this stage for what you call unrealistic ideas about how to fight terrorists, including Rubio, and Cruz on the issue of their refusing to give the President authority to enforce the redline in Syria.But, given the fact that your brother got us into two wars in Iraq and Afghanistan that have still not ended.That have still not ended, what lessons have you learned from his mistakes, sir?BUSH: Well, first, I was critical of the Senators not giving the authorization for the use of military force. They should have made it more open ended for the next president. We shouldnt have the war fighters have their arms tied behind their back as President Obama wanted to do, but they had a chance to show support and it wasnt popular at the time. It became popular after the attack in Paris, and San Bernardino. Now we hear the tough talk.Prior to that, in the Reagan Library, I gave a detailed plan. Exactly what to do as it relates to ISIS. And it is from the lessons from history that we do this because if we allow this to fester, were going to have Islamic terrorism, multi-generations of it all across this country. The caliphate of ISIS has to be destroyed, which means we need to arm directly to Kurds, imbed our troops with the Iraqi military, re engage with the Sunni tribal leaders. Get the lawyers off the damn backs of the military once and for all.(CHEERING)BUSH: Have a no fly zone in Syria and create safe zones to deal with the refugees. But, more importantly, to train a Sunni-led force in Syria to take out ISIS with our support...(BELL RINGING)BUSH: ... ground and air. Thats what we need to to, and I laid that out prior to the crisis with the advice of a lot of people, including 12 Medal of Honor recipients that Im proud that theyre supporting my campaign.(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Senator Cruz, now you get a chance to respond.CRUZ: Chris, I would note that that the last four questions have been, Rand, please attack Ted. Marco, please attack Ted. Chris, please attack Ted. Jeb, please attack Ted...(AUDIENCE)CRUZ: Let me just say this...WALLACE: ... It is a debate, sir.CRUZ: ... Well, no, no. A debate actually is a policy issue, but I will say this. Gosh, if you guys ask one more mean question I may have to leave the stage.(APPLAUSE)CRUZ: Chris, the most important determination any voter is going to make in this election is whos best prepared to be Commander in Chief. Who has the experience, who has the knowledge, who has the judgement, who has the clarity, and vision and strength of resolve to keep this country safe. That is what this debate is all about, and I would suggest lets stay focused on those issues  rather than just attacks directed at each other.WALLACE: I think the questions were about issues. Senator Rubio, what would you like to respond sir...(APPLAUSE)(CROSSTALK)PAUL: ... Senator Cruz, Id like to respond...RUBIO: ... First of all  Let me go first, and then you can please recognize Rand after.(LAUGHTER)RUBIO: First of all...PAUL: ... and Id like to respond.RUBIO: ... do I go  let me go first, and then you can please recognize Rand after. But...(LAUGHTER)... first of all...WALLACE: Thank you.PAUL: Thank you, Marco.RUBIO: ... first of all, Im  dont worry, Im not leaving the stage no matter what you ask me.WALLACE: Good.RUBIO: And second of all...(APPLAUSE)... and I think  you know, Governor  Jeb, you  the attack that  the authorization that Barack Obama asked for was not against ISIS. It was against Assad. And John Kerry described it as attacks that would be unbelievably small.I dont think the United States should be engaged in symbolic military activity. So it was not against ISIS, it was against  it was against Assad.I think the United States military is operating under rules of engagement that are too strict...(BELL RINGS)...and that do not allow us to pursue victory. When Im president, that will change.(CROSSTALK)WALLACE: Senator Paul, go ahead. PAUL: Thank you.The issue in Syrias a very important one, and its one we need to get right. The question is, should we be bombing both sides of the war? Some want (ph) to topple Assad. In fact, they want to bomb ISIS and Assad simultaneously.I think thats a really, really bad idea. In fact, Ive said for several years that arming the allies of ISIS will make the situation worse, That what we really need to do is defeat ISIS.But if you defeat Assad, what you will wind up with is a larger and more powerful ISIS that occupies that space. You might  you may well see an ISIS that takes over all of Syria.(BELL RINGS)KASICH: Chris...(APPLAUSE)... there was a question about foreign policy, by the way, and experience. And I  I thought, if I didnt jump in, I might not be able to tell everybody this. I think theyd want to hear it.Look, I served on...WALLACE: Well...(CROSSTALK)WALLACE: ... well be talking about foreign policy a little bit later. Were going to talk...KELLY: We have a lot  we have a lot to cover. But we want to  we want to turn the page to domestic...(CROSSTALK)KASICH: ... but wait a minute...KELLY: No, no. No.KASICH: ...the only reason is  look...KELLY: No no no, because we want to turn the page to domestic terror, and let me tell you why: were partnering with Google on this debate, and theyre telling us...KASICH: OK.KELLY: ... that their search results have gone through the roof on  on people...KASICH: Ive always listened to you, Megyn. Go ahead.KELLY: ... youre a good man, Governor Kasich.KASICH: Yes  thank you.KELLY: People  the search results  the searches for terror issues, for safety issues in America have gone through the roof, increased over 400 percent since 2008.People are worried. Theyre worried about whats happening in the country and about a domestic terror attack, as all of you know. Now, when combating this threat, Senator Rubio, youve advocated closing down mosques  well get back to you.Well, you have advocated closing down  closing down mosques, diners, any place where radicalization is occurring. You told me that. But the Supreme Court has made clear that hateful speech is generally protected by the First Amendment.In other words, radical Muslims have the right to be radical Muslims, unless they turn to terror. Doesnt your position run afoul of the First Amendment?RUBIO: Megyn, thats the problem. Radical Muslims and radical Islam is not just hate talk. Its hate action. They blow people up. Look what they did in San Bernardino.Look at the attack they inspired in Philadelphia, that the White House still refuses to link to terror, where a guy basically shot a police officer three times.He told the police, I did it because I was inspired by ISIS, and to this day, the White House still refuses to acknowledge it had anything to do with terror.Look, the threat we face from ISIS is unprecedented. There has never been a jihadist group like this. They have affili"
23,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/05/us/politics/transcript-of-the-democratic-presidential-debate.html,2/5/16,"Following is a transcript of the Democratic debate, as transcribed by the Federal News Service.TODD: Good evening, and welcome to the MSNBC Democratic candidates debate.MADDOW: We are super excited to be here at the University of New Hampshire. Tonight, this is the first time that Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have squared off exactly like this. Face-to-face, just one-on-one, just the two of them.TODD: And neither party has seen this yet. These candidates are both running for the Democratic nomination, but they are very different from each other when it comes to what matters most and how they would go about the job of being president. Our job tonight is to draw out those differences so you, the voters, can understand them and be fully informed.MADDOW: And we do hope that the candidates will take this opportunity to show us the distinctions  show us the differences between them. Thats the whole reason that were here tonight.Were not here for talking points. Were to learn about the difference between the candidates. And with that, lets get going. Please join us in welcoming Secretary Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders.(APPLAUSE)TODD: First, I want to say a special thanks to the New Hampshire union leader for helping make this debate possible, and the readers, who helped provide some of the questions and topics that well be addressing tonight.The rules tonight, by the way, are simple: 90 seconds for answers, 30 seconds for follow-ups and rebuttals.MADDOW: And with that, thats it. Were going to begin with 60- second opening statements from each of the candidates. And as agreed to in advance by the two campaigns, were going to begin tonight with Senator Sanders.SANDERS: Rachel, thank you very much.Millions of Americans are giving up on the political process. And theyre giving up on the political process because they understand the economy is rigged.They are working longer hours for low wages. Theyre worried about the future of their kids, and yet almost all new income and wealth is going to the top 1 percent. Not what America is supposed to be about. Not the fairness that we grew up believing that America was about. And then sustaining that rigged economy is a corrupt campaign finance system undermining American democracy, where billionaire, Wall Street, corporate America can contribute unlimited sums of money into super PACs and into candidates.Our job, together, is to end a rigged economy, create an economy that works for all, and absolutely overturn Citizens United. One person, one vote. Thats what American democracy is about.TODD: Thank you, Senator. Secretary Clinton.CLINTON: Well, Im happy to be here in New Hampshire for this debate, as we move toward the primary on Tuesday.I believe that America has the opportunity to once again live by our values, live up to our values in the 21st century, but I think that America can only do that if Americans can succeed. And there are lots of reasons why Americans today are feeling left out and left behind. CLINTON: Yes, of course, the economy has not been working for most Americans. Yes, of course, we have special interests that are unfortunately doing too much to rig the game.But theres also the continuing challenges of racism, of sexism, of discrimination against the LGBT community, of the way that we treat people as opposed to how we want to be treated.I believe that we can get back on the right track. I want to imagine a country where peoples wages reflect their hard work, where we have healthcare for everyone, and where every child gets to live up to his or her potential.Im fighting for people who cannot wait for those changes, and Im not making promises that I cannot keep.TODD: All right.Lets get started.Secretary Clinton, last night you cited the Concord Monitor when you said of Senator Sanders that, quote, Its very hard to see how any of his proposals could ever be achievable. So please tell us why you think if hes elected president on a platform of promising things like free public college and universal healthcare, that he cannot achieve those things.CLINTON: Well, let me start by saying that Senator Sanders and I share some very big progressive goals. Ive been fighting for universal healthcare for many years, and were now on the path to achieving it. I dont want us to start over again. I think that would be a great mistake, to once again plunge our country into a contentious debate about whether we should have and what kind of system we should have for healthcare.I want to build on the progress weve made; got from 90 percent coverage to 100 percent coverage. And I dont want to rip away the security that people finally have; 18 million people now have healthcare; preexisting conditions are no longer a bar. So we have a difference.I also believe in affordable college, but I dont believe in free college, because every expert that I have talked to says, look, how will you ever control the costs. What I want to do is make sure middle class kids, not Donald Trumps kids, get to be able to afford college. I want to get the economy going again. Its not just enough about what were against, as important as that is. I have a plan to create new jobs, manufacturing, infrastructure, clean energy jobs that will make us the 21st century clean energy super power. I also want to make sure small businesses can start and grow again.And of course, I believe in raising the minimum wage and equal pay for work. But the numbers just dont add up, from what Senator Sanders has been proposing. Thats why all of the independent experts, all of the editorial boards that have vetted both of us have concluded that it is just not achievable.Lets go down a path where we can actually tell people what we will do. A progressive is someone who makes progress. Thats what I intend to do.TODD: Thank you, Secretary.Senator Sanders, so just explain how you spent nearly two decades in Congress and havent gotten any of these things passed. Why do you think as president youll be able to achieve big, big new programs like this?SANDERS: Well, I havent quite run for president before.(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)Lets deal with some of the comments that Secretary Clinton made. And by the way, you know, sometimes theres a lot of drama here. I have known Secretary Clinton for 25 years and respect her very much.Here is the issue. Every major country on earth, whether its the U.K., whether its France, whether its Canada, has managed to provide healthcare to all people as a right and they are spending significantly less per capita on health care than we are. So I do not accept the belief that the United States of America cant do that.I do not accept the belief that the United States of America and our government cant stand up to the ripoffs of the pharmaceutical industry which charge us by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.Number two, in the economy today, everybody understands that we need a well educated workforce. This is 2016. When we talk about public education, it can no longer be K through 12th grade. I do believe that public colleges and universities should be tuition free. Well, how do we pay for that? Its an expensive proposition.I do believe that we should substantially lower student debt in this country, which is crushing millions of people. We pay for it, in my view, by a tax on Wall Street speculation. The middle class bailed out Wall Street in their time of need. Now, it is Wall Streets time to help the middle class.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: If I could just follow up on that.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: There is no disagreement between us on universal coverage for health care, the disagreement is where do we start from and where do we end up.The Republicans want to repeal the Affordable Care Act, I want to improve it. I want to build on it, get the costs down, get prescription drug costs down. Senator Sanders wants us to start all over again. This was a major achievement of President Obama, of our country. It is helping people right now.I am not going to wait and have us plunge back into a contentious national debate that has very little chance of succeeding. Lets make the Affordable Care Act work for everybody.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: Let me...TODD: Go.SANDERS: ... this is a good discussion here.TODD: Yes, go ahead.SANDERS: And let me just say this. As Secretary Clinton may know, I am on the Health Education Labor Committee. That committee wrote the Affordable Care Act. The idea I would dismantle health care in America while were waiting to pass a Medicare for all is just not accurate. The Affordable Care Act has clearly, as Secretary Clinton made the point, done a lot of good things, but, what it has not done is dealt with the fact we have 29 million people today who have zero health insurance, we have even more who are underinsured with large deductibles and copayments and prescription drug prices are off the wall.So I do believe that in the future, not by dismantling what we have here  I helped write that bill  but by moving forward, rallying the American people, I do believe we should have health care for all.(APPLAUSE)TODD: All right, thank you both. Rachel. MADDOW: Secretary Clinton, Senator Sanders is campaigning against you now, at this point in the campaign, basically arguing that you are not progressive enough to be the Democratic nominee. He has said that if you voted for the Iraq war, if you are in favor of the death penalty, if you wobbled on things like the Keystone Pipeline or TPP, if you said single payer health care could never happen, then youre too far to the right of the Democratic Party to be the partys standard bearer.Given those policy positions, why should liberal Democrats support you and not Senator Sanders?CLINTON: Well because I am a progressive who gets things done. And the root of that word, progressive, is progress. But Ive heard Senator Sanders comments, and its really caused me to wonder whos left in the progressive wing of the Democratic Party. Under his definition, President Obama is not progressive because he took donations from Wall Street; Vice President Biden is not progressive because she supported Keystone; Senator Shaheen is not progressive because she supports the trade pact. Even the late, great Senator Paul Wellstone would not fit this definition because he voted for DOMA.You know, we have differences and, honestly, I think we should be talk about what we want to do for the country. But if were going to get into labels, I dont think it was particularly progressive to vote against the Brady Bill five times.(APPLAUSE)I dont think it was progressive to vote to give gun makers and sellers immunity. I dont think it was progressive to vote against Ted Kennedys immigration reform. So we could go back and forth like this, but the fact is most people watching tonight want to know what weve done and what we will do. Thats why I am laying out a specific agenda that will make more progress, get more jobs with rising incomes, get us to universal health care coverage, get us to universal pre-k, paid family leave and the other elements of what I think will build a strong economy, that will ensure Americans keep making progress. Thats what Im offering and thats what I will do as president.(APPLAUSE)MADDOW: Senator Sanders, have you established a list of what it means to be a progressive that is unrealistic?SANDERS: No, not at all. Heres the reality of American economic life today. The reality is that we have one of lowest voter turnouts of any major country on earth because so many people have given up on the political process. The reality is that there has been trillions of dollars of wealth going from the middle class in the last 30 years to the top 1/10th of 1 percent.The reality is we that have a corrupt campaign finance system which separates the American peoples needs and desires from what Congress is doing. So to my mind, what we have got to do is wage a political revolution where millions of people have given up on the political process, stand up and fight back, demand the government that represents us and not just a handful of campaign contribution  contributors. SANDERS: Now all of the ideas that Im talking about, they are not radical ideas. Making public colleges and universities tuition free, that exists in countries all over the world, used to exist in the United States. Rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, and creating 13 million jobs by doing away with tax loopholes that large corporations now enjoy by putting their money into the Cayman Islands and other tax havens. That is not a radical idea.What we need to do is to stand up to the big money interests, and the campaign contributors. When we do that, we can, in fact, transform America.MADDOW: Thank you Senator.(APPLAUSE)TODD: Id like to follow up on a comment that Secretary Clinton said, Senator. President Obama has not called for abolishing the death penalty. President Obama is for the big Asian trade deal known as TPP, and just yesterday you said you cant be both a moderate or a progressive, but you cant be both. Is President Obama, in your judgment, based on these policies positions, a progressive?SANDERS: Let me just pick up on this point. This whole discussion began because I commented, not making overall evaluation about the Secretary. She was in Ohio, I think, in September or November and she got up and said something like, I have been  Im paraphrasing, I have been criticized because people think Im a moderate. Well, I am a moderate.Thats where this came from. It wasnt me paraphrasing her. It is what she said, and all that I said was theres nothing wrong with being a moderate. But, you cant be a moderate, you cant a progressive.In terms of President Obama, I think if we remember where this country was seven years ago, 800,000 jobs being lost every month, $1.4 trillion dollar deficit. The worlds financial system on the verge of collapse. I think that President Obama, Vice President Biden, and the Democratic leadership in the House and the Senate have done a fantastic job. We are in much better shape than we were seven years ago, although my Republican colleagues seem to have forgotten where we were seven years ago. Thats the fact, but, we still have a very long way to go.Do I think President Obama is a progressive? Yes, I do. I disagree with him on a number of issues including the trade agreement. But, yes, I think he has done an excellent job.CLINTON: Well, Chuck...TODD: ... (inaudible) Clinton, go ahead...CLINTON: ... If I could, you know, in the very first debate I was asked am I a moderate or a progressive and I said Im a progressive who likes to get things done. Cherry picking a quote here or there doesnt change my record of having fought for racial justice, having fought for kids rights, having fought the kind of inequities that fueled my interest in service in the first place going back to my days in the Childrens Defense Fund.It certainly didnt stop me from taking on the drug companies and the insurance companies. Before it was called Hillarycare  I mean, before it was called ObamaCare it was called Hillarycare because we took them on, and we werent successful, but we kept fighting and we got the childrens health insurance program. Every step along the way I have stood up, and fought, and have the scars to prove it.So, again...(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: ... I think its important that, look, I understand Senator Sanders really trying to distinguish himself. I understand that, thats what you do in campaigns, but at the same time lets not be  in, I think an unfair way, making an accusation, or making an attack about where I stand and about where Ive always stood.It is fair to say, Senator, that in your definition, as you being the self-proclaimed gatekeeper for progressivism, I dont know anyone else who fits that definition, but I know a lot of really hard fighting progressives in the Democratic party who have stood up time, and time again against special interests, against the powerful on behalf of those who are left behind and left out.And, thats what we ought to be celebrating. Lets talk about what we would do as President, and Commander in Chief to make sure the progress continues into the future.(APPLAUSE)TODD: (inaudible) 30 seconds, and then well move.SANDERS: Thats right, I mean, instead of arguing about definitions, lets talk about...CLINTON: ... Well, you began it yesterday with your comments...SANDERS: ... What we should do, and one of the things we should do is not only talk the talk, but walk the walk. I am very proud to be the only candidate up here who does not have a Super PAC, whos not raising huge sums of money from Wall Street...(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: ... And special interests. I am enormously proud. Never believed it would happen that we have raised 3.5 million individual contributions, averaging $27 dollars a piece. That is what the political revolution means.(APPLAUSE)TODD: Thank you.MADDOW: Senator Sanders, as a Vermonter, you have almost a home state advantage here in New Hampshire. But back home across the border, you also have a long history of running against Democrats as a third-party candidate, for governor, Senate, for Congress.In 1988 your candidacy as a third-party candidate arguably cost the Democrats a congressional seat and sent a Republican instead.How can you lead the Democratic Party nationally when you have not been a member of the Democratic Party until very recently?SANDERS: Well, Rachel, actually, that wasnt accurate. In 1988 the Republican did win, I believe, by 3 points. I came in second. It was 34-31, I think, 19 for the Democrat. In that race the Democrat was the spoiler, not me. And it is true...(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: It is true, its not to be denied, I am the longest- serving independent in the history of the United States Congress. People of Vermont sent me to Washington as an independent. That is true.But on the other hand, I have  when I was in the House for 16 years, I caucused with the Democrats. In the Senate for nine years caucused with the Democrats, of course. And I was elected by the Democrats to be chair of the Veterans Committee three years ago, which Im very proud of. And now am the rankings member on the Budget Committee, leader of the Democrats in opposition to the majority Republicans.I am running for president as a Democrat. And if elected, not only do I hope to bring forth a major change in national priorities, but let me be frank, I do want to see major changes in the Democratic Party.I want to see working people and young people come into the party in a way that doesnt exist now. And you know what, I want a 50-state strategy so the Democratic Party is not just the party of 25 states.(APPLAUSE)MADDOW: Secretary Clinton.CLINTON: You know, the person who first put out the idea of a 50-state party strategy is former Governor Howard Dean, who is with us tonight.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: And Im very proud and grateful to have the support of so many elected Vermonters and former officials. Two former governors, the current governor, the current other senator. I really appreciate that.And I think its because theyve worked with me, theyve seen what I do. They know what kind of a colleague I am. They want me as their partner in the White House. And thats exactly what I will do.Well get things done together. Democrats, Republicans, independents, were going to make progress together when Im president.(APPLAUSE)MADDOW: So, Senator, to that point, Secretary Clinton is raising the issue of endorsements by your home state Democrats. Shes implying that that says something about the people who know you best.SANDERS: Well, I dont see it quite like that.MADDOW: How do you see it?SANDERS: I am  will absolutely admit that Secretary Clinton has the support of far more governors, mayors, members of the House. She has the entire establishment or almost the entire establishment behind her. Thats a fact. I dont deny it.But I am pretty proud that we have over a million people who have contributed to our campaign averaging 27 bucks apiece. That we have had meetings where 25,000-30,000 people have come out. That our campaign is a campaign of the people, by the people, and for the people.So, Rachel, yes, Secretary Clinton does represent the establishment. I represent, I hope, ordinary Americans, and by the way, who are not all that enamored with the establishment, but I am very proud to have people like Keith Ellison and Raul Grijalva in the House, the co-chairmen of the House Progressive Caucus.MADDOW: Secretary.CLINTON: Well, look, Ive got to just jump in here because, honestly, Senator Sanders is the only person who I think would characterize me, a woman running to be the first woman president, as exemplifying the establishment. And Ive got to tell you that it is... (APPLAUSE)CLINTON: It is really quite amusing to me.People support me because they know me. They know my lifes work. They have worked with me and many have also worked with Senator Sanders. And at the end of the day they endorse me because they know I can get things done.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: I am not going to make promises I cant keep. I am not going to talk about big ideas like single-payer and then not level with people about how much it will cost.CLINTON: A respected health economist said that these plans would cost a trillion dollars more a year.Im not going to tell people that I will raise your incomes and not your taxes, and not mean it, because I dont want to see the kind of struggle that the middle class is going through exemplified by these promises that would raise taxes and make it much more difficult for many, many Americans to get ahead and stay ahead. That is not my agenda.(APPLAUSE)MADDOW: Senator Sanders, youll have 30 seconds to respond to that.SANDERS: What being part of the establishment is, is, in the last quarter, having a super PAC that raised $15 million from Wall Street, that throughout ones life raised a whole lot of money from the drug companies and other special interests.To my mind, if we do not get a handle on money in politics and the degree to which big money controls the political process in this country, nobody is going to bring about the changes that is needed in this country for the middle class and working families.CLINTON: Yeah, but I  I think its fair to really ask whats behind that comment. You know, Senator Sanders has said he wants to run a positive campaign. Ive tried to keep my disagreements over issues, as it should be.But time and time again, by innuendo, by insinuation, there is this attack that he is putting forth, which really comes down to  you know, anybody who ever took donations or speaking fees from any interest group has to be bought.And I just absolutely reject that, Senator. And I really dont think these kinds of attacks by insinuation are worthy of you. And enough is enough. If youve got something to say, say it directly.But you will not find that I ever changed a view or a vote because of any donation that I ever received.SANDERS: What...(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: And I have stood up and I have represented my constituents to the best of my abilities, and Im very proud of that.SANDERS: ... you know...CLINTON: So I think its time to end the very artful smear that you and your campaign have been carrying out...SANDERS: (inaudible).(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: ... in recent weeks, and lets talk...(BOOING)... lets talk about about the issues. Lets talk about the issues that divide us.SANDERS: Lets talk about  OK, lets talk...CLINTON: And lets  lets...SANDERS: ... let us talk about issues.CLINTON: ... we both agree with campaign finance reform.SANDERS: Lets talk about issues.CLINTON: I  I worked hard for McCain-Feingold.SANDERS: Lets...CLINTON: I want to reverse Citizens United.SANDERS: ... lets  lets  lets talk about issues.CLINTON: And so  lets talk about issues.SANDERS: Lets talk  lets talk about issues, all right? Lets talk about why, in the 1990s, Wall Street got deregulated. Did it have anything to do with the fact that Wall Street provided  spent billions of dollars on lobbying and campaign contributions?Well, some people might think, yeah, that had some influence.(LAUGHTER)Lets ask why it is that we pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs, and your medicine can be doubled tomorrow, and theres nothing that the government can do to stop it.You think it has anything to do with the huge amounts of campaign contributions and lobbying from the fossil fuel industry? Lets talk about climate change.Do you think theres a reason why not one Republican has the guts to recognize that climate change is real, and that we need to transform our energy system? Do you think it has anything to do with the Koch brothers and ExxonMobil pouring huge amounts of money into the political system?That is what goes on in America. I am not  I like...(APPLAUSE)... there is a reason. You know, there is a reason why these people are putting huge amounts of money into our political system. And in my view, it is undermining American democracy and it is allowing Congress to represent wealthy campaign contributors and not the working families of this country.CLINTON: Well, you know, Senator, I dont think  I dont...(CROSSTALK)(APPLAUSE)TODD: ... Secretary, were gonna...CLINTON: ... I dont think you could find any person in political life today who has been subjected to more attacks and had more money spent against her by special interests, among whom you have named a few, than I.And Im proud of that. You know, when I took on the drug companies and the insurance companies for universal health care coverage, they went after me with a vengeance. CLINTON: Today, youve got hedge fund billionaires aligned with Karl Rove, running ads against me to try to get Democrats to vote for you. I know this game. Im going to stop this game.But while were talking about votes, youre the one who voted to deregulate swaps and derivatives in 2000, which contributed to the over-leveraging of Lehman Brothers, which was one of the culprits that brought down the economy.So I dont know  Im not impugning your motive because you voted to deregulate swaps and derivatives. People make mistakes and Im certainly not saying you did it for any kind of financial advantage. What weve got to do as Democrats  what weve got to do as Democrats is to be united to actually solve these problems. And what I believe is that I have a better track record and a better opportunity to actually get that job done.Thats what this election should be about.(APPLAUSE)TODD: Thirty seconds.(CROSSTALK)(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: I think as Secretary Clinton knows, there is nobody who fought harder. I was on the House Financial Committee at that time. I heard the arguments coming from Democrats and Republicans  Robert Rubin, Alan Greenspan  about great an idea it would be if we did away with Glass-Steagall and if we allowed investor banks and commercial banks and big insurance companies to merge.Go to YouTube today. Look up Greenspan-Sanders. Listen to what I told them then. I helped lead the effort against deregulation. Unfortunately, we lost that. The result is  was the worst financial disaster since the Great Depression.TODD: Thank you both.MADDOW: Senator Sanders, Secretary Clinton, obviously weve touched a nerve. Were going to be back with more on this subject, and much more, right after this. Stay with us.(APPLAUSE)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(APPLAUSE)TODD: All right, welcome back. Lets get right to it.Senator Sanders, you were talking about all of your campaign contributions and campaign finance reform. You rail against big money in politics. But do you realize there is one public financing system that we do have in place, and it is  it is in place to run for president. Why arent you walking the walk on that?Why arent you participating in the presidential public financing system which is designed to essentially keep big money out of presidential politics?SANDERS: Chuck, actually we looked at it, but it turns out to be a disaster. The way it is structured right now, if you make it all the way to California, you could do pretty well. But in terms of the early states  Iowa, New Hampshire, the other states  it just doesnt work.Your point is well taken. I believe in public funding of elections, absolutely. But this system is  I dont know if the secretary would agree  is currently very antiquated and no longer applies to modern day politics.TODD: Well, going on that then, why criticize her on Super PACs, and you got  and all this when it is  you know, thats the system? I mean, you could be participating in a publicly-financing  public financing system...SANDERS: But if the...TODD: ... and being able to set  being able to set an example.SANDERS:  but Chuck, it is a public financing system that everybody knows is antiquated. It no longer works. Nobody can become president based on that system. So whats the alternative? There are two alternatives. And, you know, we looked at it. Well, should we do a Super PAC, but I concluded, honestly, I dont represent Corporate America or billionaires, I didnt want it.So the other alternative was to ask working families and the middle class to help out in a transformational campaign. And you know what? We got 3.5 million individual contributions, $27 a piece. I think thats pretty good.(APPLAUSE)MADDOW: Secretary Clinton, on the issue of Wall Street...CLINTON: On the issue of Wall Street.MADDOW: ... on the issue of Wall Street, when our reporters go out and talk to people on the ground in the early states, what they tell us over and over again when they find voters who are leaning toward Senator Sanders rather than yourself is that the most frequent area of concern that they hear from those voters is the issue of Wall Street and whether or not you are too close to Wall Street.Last night, when you were asked about speaking fees and the amount of speaking fees you got from Goldman Sachs speeches, you said thats what they offered.Have you been too dismissive of voters concerns about this issue in your own campaign and your own career?CLINTON: Well you know, Rachel, I think I may not have done the job I should in explaining my record. You know, I did  when I left the secretary of States office, like so many former officials, military leaders, journalists, others, I did go on the speaking circuit. I spoke to heart doctors, I spoke to the American Camping Association, I spoke to auto dealers, and yes, I spoke to firms on Wall Street. They wanted me to talk about the world, what my experience had been as secretary of State.But what I want people to know is I went to Wall Street before the crash. I was the one saying youre going to wreck the economy because of these shenanigans with mortgages. I called to end the carried interest loophole that hedge fund managers enjoy. I proposed changes in CEO compensation.I called for a consumer protection financial bureau before it was created. And I think the best evidence that the Wall Street people at least know where I stand and where I have always stood is because they are trying to beat me in this primary. They have collected and spent as much as $6 million on these ads. Hedge fund billionaires, Karl Rove, another billionaire, jumped in.And why are they doing that? These are guys who try to make smart investments. They know my record, they know me, they know that I say what I believe and I will do it. And I also have a pr"
24,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/07/us/politics/transcript-of-the-republican-presidential-debate-in-new-hampshire.html,2/7/16,"Following is a transcript of the Republican debate, as transcribed by the Federal News Service.MUIR: Good evening, again, everyone. This is the first time since Iowa and the only time before the New Hampshire primary that the Republican candidates will have the opportunity to face each other.MUIR: The people of Iowa have been heard. Now its New Hampshires turn. In just three days, voters here will decide who they think should be the Republican nominee for president.RADDATZ: Questions of leadership and character have dominated the news ever since the Iowa caucuses a few days ago. Here with us to question the candidates this evening are Josh McElveen from WMUR here in Manchester and author and commentator Mary Katherine Ham.MUIR: So lets welcome the candidates for the Republican nomination for president.New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.(APPLAUSE)RADDATZ: Dr. Ben Carson.(APPLAUSE)MUIR: Texas Senator Ted Cruz.(APPLAUSE)RADDATZ: Businessman Donald Trump.(APPLAUSE)MUIR: Florida Senator Marco Rubio.(APPLAUSE)RADDATZ: Former Florida Governor, Jeb Bush.(APPLAUSE)MUIR: And Ohio Governor John Kasich.(APPLAUSE)RADDATZ: Ladies and gentlemen, the Republican candidates.(APPLAUSE)MUIR: And Dr. Ben Carson, please come out on the stage. Hes standing there, as well. Dr. Carson.(APPLAUSE)RADDATZ: And Donald Trump.(APPLAUSE)MUIR: And lastly, we welcome back to the debate stage, Donald Trump.(APPLAUSE)RUBIO (?): What about Kasich? Can I introduce Kasich?MUIR: It was so noisy in here. Yes. Yes. Were going to introduce Ohio Governor John kasich.(APPLAUSE)MUIR: The applause so loud here in the hall.RADDATZ: The applause so loud you couldnt hear. We couldnt hear, either. Thats a good sign for the excitement this evening.Gentlemen, thank you for being here tonight, just days before voters here in New Hampshire make their decisions. The rules are simple and have been agreed to by all the campaigns. There will be 60 seconds to answer and if another candidate is mentioned in that answer, that candidate will have 30 seconds to respond. There are green, yellow and red lights that each candidate will see to signal when time is up and they will also hear this sound.MUIR: So lets get started. We welcome you all to the debate stage here tonight. Were going to tackle the issues Americans are most concerned about, the economy, ISIS, Homeland Security. And here in New Hampshire, some of the most heated rhetoric yet over who is best suited to step in on day one, who has the experience, who has the temperament to be commander-in-chief.Mr. Trump, Senator Cruz has said about you right here in New Hampshire this week, quote, I dont know anyone who would be comfortable with someone who behaves this way, having his finger on the button. Were liable to wake up one morning, and if he were president, he would nuke Denmark. Saying, quote, Thats temperament of a leader to keep this country safe.I wanted to give you the opportunity to respond to this and to tell the American people tonight why you do have the temperament to be commander-in-chief.TRUMP: I actually think I have the best temperament. I built a massive corporation. I employ thousands and thousands of people. Ive gotten along with people for years and years, have tremendous relationships with many people, including politicians on both sides. And no matter how you cut it, when I  when I came out, I hit immigration, I hit it very hard. Everybody said, Oh, the temperament, because I talked about illegal immigration.TRUMP: Now, everybodys coming to me, theyre all trying to say, well, hes right, we have to come to him. I hit other things. I talked about Muslims. We have a problem. Nobody else wanted to mention the problem, I brought it up. I took a lot of heat. We have to have a temporary something, because theres something going on thats not good. And remember this, Im the only one up here, when the war of Iraq  in Iraq, I was the one that said, Dont go, dont do it, youre going to destabilize the Middle East. So, Im not one with a trigger. Im not one with a trigger. Other people up here, believe me, would be a lot faster.But Ill build the mill arbitrary stronger, bigger, better than anybody up here, and nobody is going to mess with us. That, I can tell you.(APPLAUSE)MUIR: Mr. Trump, thank you. I want to bring this to Senator Cruz, then.Because Senator, you did said of Trumps behavior this week, thats not the temperament of a leader to keep this country safe.Why not?CRUZ: Well, you know, David, the assessment the voters are making here in New Hampshire and across the country is they are evaluating each and every one of us. They are looking to our experience. They are looking to our knowledge. They are looking to our temperament and judgment. They are looking to our clarity of vision and our strength of resolve.The world is getting much more dangerous. Weve had seven years with Barack Obama in the oval office, a commander-in-chief that is unwilling even to acknowledge the enemy were facing. This is a president who, in the wake of Paris, in the wake of San Bernardino, will not even use the words radical Islamic terrorism, much less focus on defeating the enemy.I am convinced every individual standing on this stage, would make a much better commander-in-chief than Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders.(APPLAUSE)And the primary voters are making the assessment for each of us, who is best prepared to keep this country safe, to rebuild the military, to rebuild our Navy, our Air Force, our Army, our Marines, and to ensure that we keep America safe.MUIR: Senator Cruz, I did ask about Mr. Trump. You said he doesnt have the temperament to be commander-in-chief. Do you stand by those words?CRUZ: I think that is an assessment the voters are going to make. And they are going to make it of each and everyone of us. They are going to assess who is level-headed, who has clear vision, who has judgment, who can confront our enemies, who can confront the threats we face in this country, and who can have the judgment when to engage and when not to engage  both are incredibly important for a commander-in-chief, knowing how to go after our enemies.In the case of Iran, for example, who has the clarity of vision to understand that the Ayatollah Khamenei, when he chants, Death to America, he means it. We need a president with the judgment and resolve to keep this country safe from radical Islamic terrorists.MUIR: Senator Cruz, thank you. Were going to continue on this notion of readiness and experience. Im going to come back.TRUMP: Am I allowed to respond? I have to respond.MUIR: If you would like to respond, Mr. Trump.TRUMP: First of all, I respect what Ted just said, but if you noticed, he didnt answer your question. And thats whats going to happen  OK.(APPLAUSE)Thats whats going to happen with our enemies and the people we compete against. Were going to win with Trump. Were going to win. We dont win anymore. Our country doesnt win anymore. Were going to win with Trump. And people back down with Trump. And thats what I like and thats what the country is going to like.(APPLAUSE)MUIR: Mr. Trump, thank you. And were going to continue on this notion of readiness and on experience, but I want to ask about a headline that was back in the papers again this morning.Dr. Carson, on the day of the Iowa caucuses, the Cruz campaign sent out messages and voicemails saying, quote, Breaking news. Dr. Ben Carson will be planning to suspend his campaign following tonights caucuses. Please inform any Carson caucus-goers of this news.But as we can all see, you are still standing here tonight. Late this week, your campaign sent this e-mail, quote, This kind of deceitful behavior is why the American people dont trust politicians. If Senator Cruz does not act, then he clearly represents D.C. values.What kind of action do you think Senator Cruz should take?CARSON: Well, you know, when I wasnt introduced No. 2, as was the plan, I thought maybe he thought I already had dropped out. But...(APPLAUSE)But you know, today is the 105th anniversary, or  105th birthday of Ronald Reagan. His 11 Commandment was not to speak ill of another Republican. So, Im not going to use this opportunity to savage the reputation of Senator Cruz.(APPLAUSE)But I will say  I will say  I will say that I was very disappointed that members of his team thought so little of me that they thought that after having hundreds, if not thousands of volunteers and college students who sacrificed their time and were dedicated to the cause  one even died  to think that I would just walk away ten minutes before the caucus and say, Forget about you guys.CARSON: I mean, who would do something like that? Now, I dont think anyone on this stage would do something like that. And to assume that someone would, what does that tell you? So, unfortunately, it did happen.It gives us a very good example of certain types of Washington ethics. Washington ethics. Washington ethics basically says, if its legal, you do what you need to do in order to win. Thats not my ethics. My ethics is, you do whats right.MUIR: Senator Cruz.(APPLAUSE)MUIR: Dr. Carson, thank you.Senator Cruz, you have said that Dr. Carson and his wife have become friends of yours. Im curious as why you didnt call ahead of time to either the doctor or his wife or have your campaign check in with the other campaign before sending out those messages.CRUZ: Ben is a good and honorable man and Ben and Candy have become friends. He has an amazing life story that has inspired millions, including me. When this transpired, I apologized to him then and I do so now. Ben, Im sorry.Let me tell you the facts of what occurred for those who are interested in knowing. On Monday night, about 6:30 p.m., CNN reported that Ben was not going from Iowa to New Hampshire or South Carolina. Rather, he was, quote, Taking a break from campaigning.They reported that on television, CNNs political anchors, Jake Tapper and Dana Bash and Wolf Blitzer, said it was highly unusual and highly significant. My political team saw CNNs report breaking news and they forwarded that news to our volunteers, it was being covered on live television.Now, at the time, I was at the caucuses, I was getting ready to speak at the caucuses just like Ben was, just like everyone else was. I knew nothing about this. A couple hours later, I found out about it. I was told that Ben was unhappy. I called him that evening because I respect him very, very highly. I didnt reach him that evening.(BELL RINGS)I reached him the next day and apologized. He asked me then, he said, Ted, would you make this apologize in public? I said, yes, I will. And I did so. I regret that subsequently, CNN reported on that  they didnt correct that story until 9:15 that night. So from 6:30 p.m. to 9:15, thats what CNN was reporting.Subsequent to that initial report, Bens campaign put out a statement saying that he was not suspending his campaign. I wish that our campaign staff had forwarded that statement. They were unaware of it, I wish that they had, thats why I apologized.MUIR: Senator Cruz, thank you.Were going to move on here. Back to the issues...CARSON: Since I was mentioned...MUIR: Dr. Carson, please.CARSON: This is great you guys. I want you all to mention me when you say something.(LAUGHTER)In fact, the time line indicates that initial tweet from CNN was followed by another one within one minute that clarified that I was not dropping out. So, what happened to that one, it is unclear. But the bottom line is, we can see what happened, everybody can see what happened and you can make your own judgment.MUIR: Dr. Carson, thank you. Thank you, doctor.Senator Rubio. I want to stay on the issue of readiness to be president and experience and questions about you being a first-term senator.Governor Christie warning voters here in New Hampshire against voting for another first-term senator as America did with Barack Obama in 2008. Arguing that you are, quote,  not ready to be president of the United States.And Senator Santorum, who we all know, dropped out of the race and endorsed you, had a hard time when asked on national television, listing your accomplishments as senator. Tonight, what are your accomplishments in the Senate that demonstrate you are ready to be president of the United States?RUBIO: Well, let me say, from protecting the people of Florida from imminent domain abuse, to bringing accountability to the V.A., to the Girls Count Act, to sanctioning groups, Im proud of my service in the United States Senate and before that, in the Florida legislature.I will say, if politics becomes and the presidency becomes about electing people who have been Congress or in the Senate the longest, we should all rally around Joe Biden. Hes been around 1,000 years. Hes passed hundreds of bills and I dont think any of us believe Joe Biden should be president of the United States.And lets dispel once and for all with this fiction that Barack Obama doesnt know what hes doing. He knows exactly what hes doing. Barack Obama is undertaking a systematic effort to change this country, to make America more like the rest of the world.Thats why he passed Obamacare and the stimulus and Dodd-Frank and the deal with Iran. It is a systematic effort to change America. When Im president of the United States, we are going to re-embrace all the things that made America the greatest nation in the world and we are going to leave our children with what they deserve: the single greatest nation in the history of the world.MUIR: Senator Rubio, thank you.(APPLAUSE)MUIR: I do want to ask Governor Christie, Governor Christie, you said fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me when it comes to electing a first-term senator. You heard Senator Rubio make the case that he does have the experience. Your response?CHRISTIE: Sure. First, lets remember something. Every morning when a United States senator wakes up, they think about what kind of speech can I give or what kind of bill can I drop? Every morning, when I wake up, I think about what kind of problem do I need to solve for the people who actually elected me?Its a different experience, its a much different experience. And the fact is, Marco, you shouldnt compare yourself to Joe Biden and you shouldnt say that thats what were doing. Here is exactly what were doing.You have not be involved in a consequential decision where you had to be held accountable. You just simply havent.(APPLAUSE)And the fact is  the fact when you talk about the Hezbollah Sanctions Act that you list as one of your accomplishments you just did, you werent even there to vote for it. Thats not leadership, thats truancy.(APPLAUSE)And the fact is that what we need to do  what we need to have in this country is not to make the same mistake we made eight years ago. The fact is it does matter when you have to make decisions and be held accountable for them. It does matter when the challenges dont come on a list of a piece of paper of what to vote yes or no every day, but when the problems come in from the people that you serve.I like Marco Rubio, and hes a smart person and a good guy, but he simply does not have the experience to be president of the United States and make these decisions. Weve watched it happen, everybody. For the last seven years, the people of New Hampshire are smart. Do not make the same mistake again.RUBIO: If I may respond to that.(APPLAUSE)MUIR: Governor, thank you. Senator Rubio?RUBIO: Well, I think the experience is not just what you did, but how it worked out. Under Chris Christies governorship of New Jersey, theyve been downgraded nine times in their credit rating. This country already has a debt problem, we dont need to add to it by electing someone who has experience at running up and destroying the credit rating of his state.But I would add this. Lets dispel with this fiction that Barack Obama doesnt know what hes doing. He knows exactly what hes doing. He is trying to change this country. He wants America to become more like the rest of the world. We dont want to be like the rest of the world, we want to be the United States of America. And when Im elected president, this will become once again, the single greatest nation in the history of the world, not the disaster Barack Obama has imposed upon us.MUIR: Senator Rubio, thank you. I want to bring in governor bush on this, because you...CHRISTIE: Hold on one second.MUIR: ... have made this...CHRISTIE: Excuse me...MUIR: If youd like to respond to economic...CHRISTIE: I think he mentioned me and my record in there, so I think I get a chance to respond. You see, everybody, I want the people at home to think about this. Thats what Washington, D.C. Does. The drive-by shot at the beginning with incorrect and incomplete information and then the memorized 25-second speech that is exactly what his advisers gave him.(APPLAUSE)See Marco  Marco, the thing is this. When youre president of the United States, when youre a governor of a state, the memorized 30-second speech where you talk about how great America is at the end of it doesnt solve one problem for one person. They expect you to plow the snow. They expect you to get the schools open. And when the worst natural disaster in your states history hits you, they expect you to rebuild their state, which is what Ive done.None of that stuff happens on the floor of the United States Senate. Its a fine job, Im glad you ran for it, but it does not prepare you for president of the United States.(APPLAUSE)MUIR: Senator Rubio?RUBIO: Chris  Chris, your state got hit by a massive snowstorm two weeks ago. You didnt even want to go back. They had to shame you into going back. And then you stayed there for 36 hours and then he left and came back to campaign. Those are the facts.Heres the bottom line. This notion that Barack Obama doesnt know what hes doing is just not true. He knows exactly what hes doing.CHRISTIE: There it is. There it is. The memorized 25-second speech. There it is, everybody.RUBIO: Well, thats the  thats the reason why this campaign is so important. Because I think this notion  I think this is an important point. We have to understand what were going through here. We are not facing a president that doesnt know what hes doing. He knows what he is doing. Thats why hes done the things hes done.Thats why we have a president that passed Obamacare and the stimulus. All this damage that hes done to America is deliberate. This is a president thats trying to redefine this country. Thats why this election is truly a referendum on our identity as a nation, as a people. Our future is at stake.This election is not about the past. It is about what kind of country this is going to be in the 21st century, and if we elect someone like Barack Obama, a Hillary Clinton, a Bernie Sanders or anyone like that, our children are going to be the first Americans to inherit a diminishes country. That will not happen if Im elected.MUIR: Governor Christie, we will  we will...BUSH: Chris, why dont you mention my name so I can get into this.CHRISTIE: You know what the shame is  you know what the shame is, Marco? The shame is that you would actually criticize somebody for showing up to work, plowing the streets, getting the trains running back on time when youve never been responsible for that in your entire life.RUBIO: Chris, you didnt want to go back. You didnt want to go back.(APPLAUSE)CHRISTIE: And the fact is, I went back, it got done and heres...RUBIO: You didnt want to go back, Chris.CHRISTIE: Oh, so  wait a second. Is that one of the skills you get as a United States senator ESP also? Because I dont think it is.RUBIO: Chris, everybody  you said you werent going to go back. He told everyone he wasnt going to go back. They had to shame him into going back. And when he decided to go back, he criticized the young lady, saying, what am I supposed to do, go back with a mop and clean up the flooding?CHRISTIE: It gets very unruly when he gets off his talking points. MUIR: Governor Christie  thank you, Governor. I will mention  listen...RUBIO: ... Its your record, its not a talking point...MUIR: ... Listen, people...(APPLAUSE)MUIR: Governor Bush, Ill mention your name so that you can come in on this...BUSH: ... I appreciate that, I really do, thank you.MUIR: I want to bring you in on this because youve made this central to your campaign right here in New Hampshire in the last couple of days. Four Years ago you said of Senator Rubio, he was ready to be Vice President. You spoke of his experience as well. You said he has the fortitude to be a good President, but just this week you said Senator Rubio accomplished, quote, nothing in the Senate. How do you square the two?BUSH: Well, first of all he said the exact same thing about me, that I would make a great Vice Presidential nominee when Mitt Romney was considering. I said the same thing about Marco. I think we were both right at the time, and Mitt picked somebody else. So, lets move on to the 2016 race. Who has the leadership skills...(APPLAUSE)BUSH: ... Who has the leadership skills to lead? And, Im proud of the fact that I have 12 Medal of Honor recipients, over 30 admirals and generals that believe that I would be a steady hand as Commander in Chief. That I serve as Governor of the state of Florida where we cut taxes and reduced government. I took on very powerful interests, forged consensus, fought for my beliefs, implemented them and the state was better off.We had eight hurricanes and four tropical storms in 16 months. The whole state was turned upside down. It required a steady hand. Leadership. You learn this, you learn it by doing it. Its not something that you just go up, and on the job do it.(APPLAUSE)BUSH: Its not the same. Look, lets be clear. Marco Rubio is a gifted, gifted politician, and he may have the skills to be a President of the United States, but weve tried it the old way with Barack Obama, with soaring eloquence and we got  we didnt get a leader we got someone who wants to divide the country up. The next President...(BELL RINGING)BUSH: ... going to have to forge consensus to bring about a set of common purposes so that we can move forward again in this country...MUIR: ... Were going to continue with leadership now. Martha?RADDATZ: Senator Cruz, you are a first term Senator as well. Your opponents say you, like Senator Rubio, are not prepared to be Commander in Chief. You have talked tough about threats we face in the Mid-East. It was reported just moments ago that the North Koreans test launched an intercontinental ballistic missile. North Korea has nuclear weapons, and conducted another nuclear test just last month.The missile that was launched is the kind the North Koreans hope could someday carry a nuclear weapon capable of reaching the United States. How would you respond if Commander in Chief to that launch?CRUZ: Well, I would note, initially the fact that were seeing the launch, and were seeing the launch from a nuclear North Korea is the direct result of the failures of the first Clinton administration. The Clinton administration led the world in relaxing sanctions against North Korea. Billions of dollars flowed into North Korea in exchange for promises not to build nuclear weapons. They took those billions and built nuclear weapons.And, I would note also the lead negotiator in that failed North Korea sanctions deal was a woman named Wendy Sherman who Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton promptly recruited to come back to be the lead negotiator with Iran. So, what we are seeing with North Korea is foreshadowing of where we will be with Iran.With respect to North Korea and what we should do now, one of the first things we should do is expand our missile defense capacity. We ought to put missile defense interceptors in South Korea. South Korea wants them. One of the real risks of this launch, North Korea wants to launch a satellite, and one of the greatest risks of the satellite is they would place a nuclear device in the satellite. As it would orbit around the Earth, and as it got over the United States they would detonate that nuclear weapon and set of whats called an EMP, and electromagnetic pulse which could take down the entire electrical grid on the Eastern seaboard, potentially killing millions.We need to harden the grid to defend ourselves, and we need missile defense to protect ourselves against North Korea.RADDATZ: Well, let me ask you this, if you were Commander in Chief tonight would you have order the U.S. military to destroy that missile preemptively on the launchpad to prevent North Korea from becoming an even graver threat?CRUZ: You know, at this point Im not going to speculate on that without the intelligence briefing that any Commander in Chief would have, knowing what exactly is there.(APPLAUSE)CRUZ: One of the real problems...RADDATZ: ... Senator Cruz, let me tell you this, you have talked tough about the Mid-East, you havent gotten those intelligence briefings about that. Why not tell us whether you would preemptively strike a missile on a launchpad that threatens the U.S...CRUZ: ... Actually, with respect, I have gotten the intelligence briefings on the Mid-East. Those have been going on for many years. I havent gotten the intelligence briefing tonight on what North Koreas doing because Im here in new Hampshire. When youre responding to an immediate incident, you need to know the intelligence of whats occurring.CRUZ: But what I was saying  look, it is qualitatively different dealing with a country once they have nuclear weapons. Its why you prevent them from getting nuclear weapons in the first place  because your hands are somewhat tied once they have nukes.Its why this Iranian nuclear deal is so catastrophic, and its why Ive pledged, on the very first day in office, to rip to shreds this Iranian nuclear deal so were not sitting here in five years, wondering what to do about an Iranian missile launch when they have nuclear weapons. The stakes are too high for that.RADDATZ: Okay. Senator Cruz, I will say that missile has been sitting there for quite some time, and they have had eyes on it.RUBIO: But Martha, just  Martha, just to clarify on that point, because hes right, and one more thing to point  it is standard procedure of the United States to shoot down those missiles once launched if they pose a threat to civilians, land and ships (ph).RADDATZ: Senator Rubio, Im talking about a preemptive strike on the launch pad.RUBIO: Well  no, I understand. And not  but  but I think its important to note that it is  and Senator Cruz, I think, was alluding to this, as well  it is the standard procedure of the United States, if those missiles pose a threat to land, civilians, our allies or any of our assets, to shoot down that missile in mid-flight.I understand your question was about a preemptive strike, but my point is that there is in place now contingencies to avoid any sort of that strike (ph) from going errant and destroying any  any assets of the United States, or implicating or hurting any of our allies or any of our assets in the region.RADDATZ: OK. Thank you, Senator Rubio.Governor Kasich, how would you respond to tonights launch?KASICH: Well, weve got to to step up the pressure. And by the way, Ive gotta say, after being here, every one of my 100 town hall meetings in New Hampshire were a lot more fun than what I saw here today, were so much more positive.Look, in terms of North Korea, Martha, we have to make sure that we intercept both the ships and their aircraft, because what theyre trying to do is to proliferate this very dangerous material, along with the  with the technology, the instruments that can be used for mass destruction.Thats what I worry about the most, frankly, is non-state actors, people who dont have a uniform, people dont have a country, who can spread this, who are not subject to the  to the mutual assured defense. In other words, you strike us, we strike you.Some of these radicals, they dont care about that. Thats what I worry about, for my children, and for their children, going forward. So, we have to be very tough.And we should tell the Chinese, look, if youre not going to do this ballistic missile defense to the Koreans, ballistic missile defense to Japan  and by the way, we should impose the same kind of sanctions on North Korea that we imposed on Iran, because theyre able to shift money. Theyre able to send money and receive money.(BELL RINGS)KASICH: Weve gotta to be very tough on this. And frankly, I think we could have  I think we could have let the Japanese know that if you want to take action on that  on that missile thats rising, you want to take action  you will have our support, if thats what you think is the best thing to do. We cannot continue to be weak in the face of the North Koreans, or, frankly, in the entire rest of the world.Martha, this is  this is the  relates...RADDATZ: Thank you, Governor Kasich. Thank you  thank you...BUSH: ... this relates to strategic patience.(APPLAUSE)RADDATZ: ... Governor Bush, Ill get to you in a moment.BUSH: This relates to the strategic patience of the Obama administration. They come up with these great marketing terms, and what they do is they pull back, and voids are filled, and theyre now filled by asymmetric threats of terror, as well as nation-states on the run.The next president of the United States is gonna have to get the United States back in the game, and if a preemptive strike is necessary to keep us safe, then we should do it.(APPLAUSE)RADDATZ: Thank you, Governor Bush.Mr. Trump, do you have a red line with North Korea? Would you consider military action? And how far would you let them go?TRUMP: Well, let me say a couple of things. First of all, Marco said earlier on that President Obama knows exactly what hes doing, like we have this president that really knows. I disagree, respectfully, with Marco.I think we have a president who, as a president, is totally incompetent, and he doesnt know what hes doing.(APPLAUSE)I think he has no idea what hes doing. And our country is going to hell. So, I just want to say, we disagree on that. Is that okay?RUBIO: Yeah. I have a  I got mentioned, can I respond?TRUMP: Good.RADDATZ: And Id like him to finish the question, please.TRUMP: As to North Korea?RADDATZ: Specific  as to North Korea.TRUMP: We have  tremendous  has been just sucked out of our country by China. China says they dont have that good of control over North Korea. They have tremendous control. I deal with the Chinese all of the time. I do tremendous  the largest bank in the world is in one of my buildings in Manhattan.I deal with them. They tell me. They have total, absolute control, practically, of North Korea. They are sucking trillions of dollars out of our country  theyre rebuilding China with the money they take out of our country. I would get on with China, let China solve that problem.(BELL RINGS)They can do it quickly and surgically. Thats what we should do with North Korea.RADDATZ: Senator Rubio, you were mentioned.(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: Heres the broader point, as well, and then I think it touches on what Donald just menti"
25,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/25/opinion/governors-unite-in-the-war-against-opioids.html,2/25/16,"State governments are at the front lines of the countrys epidemic of drug overdose deaths. Thats why it is important that the National Governors Association says it will come up with  protocols for dispensing prescription painkillers that are among the biggest sources of addiction and abuse in the country.The protocols, or guidelines, would restrict how and under what circumstances doctors could prescribe a category of pain drugs known as opioids. They might, for example, impose limits on how many pills doctors could prescribe to patients who have had minor surgery or dental procedures.More than 47,000 people died from drug overdoses in 2014; 61 percent of those deaths involved opioids like the prescription drug oxycodone, and illegal substances like heroin, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The rate of drug overdose deaths has increased by 140 percent since 2000, while prescriptions for opioid painkillers have quadrupled in roughly the same period. Experts say many patients who become addicted go on to use heroin and other illegal opioids.The governors associations health and human services committee is expected to present the protocols at a meeting in July. Legislators and governors in each state could then adopt those standards into their laws and regulations, which would make meaningful enforcement against excessive prescriptions more likely. Some leaders intend to act even sooner. The governors of New England states like Vermont and Massachusetts say they will work together to come up with common prescribing guidelines for their states within a few weeks.Done right, the guidelines  being developed with medical specialists, government regulators, insurance companies and other experts  should reduce the number of excessive prescriptions. Similar efforts by some states and insurance companies have shown promising results. Florida, for example, reduced its prescription drug overdose death rate by 23 percent between 2010 and 2012 after it strengthened its prescribing laws and increased enforcement against doctors who dispensed too many pills, often because it was financially lucrative. And Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts has reduced opioid use by, among other things, requiring some patients to use just one pharmacy to fill their prescriptions.On the federal front, the C.D.C. is expected to publish voluntary guidelines soon for doctors in treating chronic pain in adults. And Congress is considering a bill that would require the secretary of health and human services to convene a task force to develop best practices for prescribing painkillers.Drug companies and some doctors will push back against any limits on prescriptions enacted by state lawmakers. The American Medical Association says the decision to prescribe drugs should stay in the hands of physicians. Of course, doctors should have discretion to make medical decisions, including what drugs to use, but state governments also have a duty to protect people by placing sensible limits on the use of risky substances.Obviously, reducing the number of opioid prescriptions only addresses part of the addiction problem. Earlier this month, President Obama proposed spending $1.1 billion on treatment and prevention programs. And Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat of New Hampshire, has proposed $600 million in emergency funding to address the opioid crisis. These requests are surely reasonable, given the size of the national problem."

(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: An enthusiastic crowd is on hand here in the beautiful opera house at the Moore School of Music. Texas is the biggest prize next Tuesday, Super Tuesday, when 11 states vote, a day that will go a long way towards deciding who wins the Republican nomination.We want to welcome our viewers in the United States and around the world. Im Wolf Blitzer. This debate is airing on CNN, CNN International, and CNN in Espanol. Its also being seen on Telemundo and heard on the Salem Radio Network. Telemundo and Salem are our partners in this debate, along with the Republican National Committee.Wed also like to welcome a very special guest with us here tonight. Ladies and gentlemen, the 41st president of the United States, George Herbert Walker Bush and former first lady Barbara Bush.(APPLAUSE)Everyone here is looking forward to a lively debate. Ill be your moderator tonight. Joining me in the questioning, Telemundo host Maria Celesta Arrasas, CNN Chief Political Correspondent Dana Bash; and Salem Radio Networks Hugh Hewitt, who worked in the Reagan administration for six years.Tonight, there are five Republican candidates and theyre ready to join us right now.Please welcome Ohio Governor John Kasich.(APPLAUSE)Senator Ted Cruz of Texas.(APPLAUSE)Businessman and real estate developer Donald Trump.(APPLAUSE)Senator Marco Rubio of Florida.(APPLAUSE)And retired neurosurgeon, Dr. Ben Carson.(APPLAUSE)Ladies and gentlemen, welcome the Republican candidates for president of the United States.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Now please rise for our national anthem, performed by country music artist, Deana Carter.(THE STAR-SPANGLED BANNER)(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Thank you very much, Deana Carter. A beautiful, beautiful national anthem.The final debate before Super Tuesday begins right after this quick break. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Welcome back to the University of Houston and the Republican presidential debate.The candidates, they are now in place. Their positions were selected based on their standing in the delegate race through Nevada, with the top candidate in the center and the others extending outward.I want to tell you how tonights debate will work. As moderator, I will guide the discussion, asking questions and follow-ups, as will Maria Celeste, Dana Bash and Hugh Hewitt. Candidates, youll have a minute and 15 seconds to answer and 30 seconds for follow-ups and rebuttals. We have timing lights that are visible to the candidates. Those lights will warn you when your time is up, and as the candidates requested, a bell will sound like this.(BELL RINGS)We know you all want to jump and debate these critically important issues, but please wait until youre called on. These are the rules all of the candidates have agreed to.Its time for the candidates to introduce themselves right now. Youll each have 30 seconds. Dr. Carson, youre first.CARSON: If someone had tried to describe todays America to you 30 years ago, you would have listened in disbelief. Americans know that our nation is heading off the abyss of destruction, secondary to divisiveness, fiscal irresponsibility, and failure to lead.Marco, Donald, Ted, John, we will not solve any of these problems by trying to destroy each other. What we need to do is be looking for solutions tonight. Its not about us, its about the American people.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Governor Kasich?KASICH: Well, you know, on the way over here, even getting ready earlier and sitting in the green room and watching the early coverage, you know, my father carried mail on his back and his father was a coal miner and my mothers mother was an immigrant, could barely speak English. And Im standing on this stage. Its pretty remarkable. But I want to tell you, theres a lot of young people watching tonight. You can do whatever you want to do in your life. America is an amazing country, where a kid like me can grow up to run for president of the United States and be on this stage tonight. So to all the young people that are out there, your hopes, your dreams, pursue them. Shoot for the stars. Americas great, and you can do it. Thank you, Wolf.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Senator Rubio?RUBIO: Well, thank you. This election, we have to decide the identity of America in the 2ist century, but as part of this primary, we have to find out our identity as a party and as a movement.Thirty-six years ago, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush began the Reagan Revolution. For a generation, they defined conservatism as limited government and free enterprise and a strong national defense. But they also appealed to our hopes and our dreams. Now we have to decide if we are still that kind of party and still that kind of movement, or if were simply going to become a party that preys on peoples angers and fears.I hope we remain that conservative movement that appeals to our hopes and our dreams and the belief that America will always be better in its future than its been in its story history.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Senator Cruz?CRUZ: Welcome to Texas.(APPLAUSE)Here, Texas provided my family with hope. Here, my mom became the first in her family ever to go to college. Here, my dad fled Cuba and washed dishes, making 50 cents an hour to pay his way through the University of Texas. I graduated from high school at Second Baptist not too far away from here. CRUZ: When I ran for Senate, I promised 27 million Texans I would fight for you every day, and not for the Washington bosses.And, Ill tell you, as I travel the state, Democrats tell me I didnt vote for you, but youre doing what you said you would do. And, as president, I will do the same.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Mr. Trump.TRUMP: Thank you. My whole theme is make America great again. We dont win anymore as a country. We dont win with trade, we dont win with the military. ISIS, we cant even knock out ISIS, and we will, believe me. We will.We dont win in any capacity with healthcare. We have terrible health care, Obamacare is going to be repealed and replaced. We just dont win.You look at our borders, theyre like swiss cheese, everybody pours in.Were going to make a great country again. Were going to start winning again. Were going to win a lot, its going to be a big difference, believe me. Its going to be a big difference.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Thank you very much. Its now time to begin questions. Voters in the first four states have spoken, and Mr. Trump has emerged as the frontrunner, but in five days the candidates will face their biggest test yet, Super Tuesday. When nearly half of the delegates needed to win the Republican nomination will be awarded, and the biggest prize of the night is Texas.Immigration is a key issue in this state, for all voters nationwide, including the many people watching us on Telemundo. So, thats where we begin.Mr. Trump, youve called for a deportation force to remove the 11 million undocumented immigrants from the United States. Youve also promised to let what you call, the good ones, come back in. Your words, the good ones, after theyve been deported.Senator Cruz would not allow them to come back in. He says thats the biggest difference between the two of you. He calls your plan amnesty. Is it?TRUMP: First of all, he was in charge of amnesty, he was the leader, and you can ask Marco because theyve been debating this every debate that weve had.As far as coming back in, number one, you wouldnt even be talking, and you wouldnt have asked that as the first question if it werent for me when my opening when I talked about illegals immigration. It wouldnt even be a big subject.But, we either have a country, or we dont have a country. We have at least 11 million people in this country that came in illegally. They will go out. They will come back  some will come back, the best, through a process. They have to come back legally. They have to come back through a process, and it may not be a very quick process, but I think thats very fair, and very fine.Theyre going to get in line with other people. The best of them will come back, but theyre going to come back through a process.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Senator Cruz, whats wrong with letting what Mr. Trump calls, the good ones come back to the United States?CRUZ: You know, the people that get forgotten in this debate over immigration are the hardworking men and women of this country  our millions of Americans who are losing their jobs. Millions of legal immigrants who are losing their jobs are seeing their wages driven down.You know, in the past couple of weeks the Wall Street Journal had a very interesting article about the state of Arizona. Arizona put in very tough laws on illegal immigration, and the result was illegal immigrants fled the state, and whats happened there  it was a very interesting article.Some of the business owners complained that the wages they had to pay workers went up, and from their perspective that was a bad thing. But, what the state of Arizona has seen is the dollars theyre spending on welfare, on prisons, and education, all of those have dropped by hundreds of millions of dollars. And, the Americans, and for that matter, the legal immigrants who are in Arizona, are seeing unemployment drop are seeing wages rise. Thats who we need to be fighting for.Listen, we have always welcomed legal immigrants, but I think it is a mistake to forgive those who break the law to allow them to become U.S. citizens, and thats why Ive led the fight against granting citizenship to those here illegally, and thats why I will do the same thing as president.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: Mr. Trump, do you want to respond to that? TRUMP: Well, Im very glad that Ted mentioned Arizona because probably the toughest man on borders is Sheriff Joe Arpaio, and two days ago he totally endorsed me, so, thank you.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Senator Rubio?RUBIO: Senator Cruz has called your immigration plan amnesty, and has an add out there comparing it to President Obamas. He says both of you support allowing undocumented immigrants legal status here in the United States after a background check, paying a fine, and paying taxes.Are those claims correct?RUBIO: Well, first of all, and before we do anything, Ive been abundantly clear on this. When Im president of the United States, before we do anything on immigration, we are going to secure the border. And, thats not just the physical border with Mexico, its Visa overstays. Thats 45 percent of the problem right there.RUBIO: It also has to do  thats why we need e-verify, and entry-exit tracking system, and so-forth. And, until that happens, were not doing anything else. And then well see what the American people are willing to support.And Donald mentioned, because he mentioned me in his answer, that his position on immigration is what has driven this debate. Well, the truth is, though, that a lot of these positions that hes now taking are new to him.In 2011, he talked about the need for a pathway to citizenship. In 2012, Donald criticized Mitt Romney, saying that Mitt lost his election because of self-deportation.And so even today, we saw a report in one of the newspapers that Donald, youve hired a significant number of people from other countries to take jobs that Americans could have filled.My mom and dad  my mom was a maid at a hotel, and instead of hiring an American like her, you have brought in over a thousand people from all over the world to fill those jobs instead.So I think this is an important issue. And I think we are realizing increasingly that its an important issue for the country that has been debated for 30 years, but finally needs to be solved once and for all.BLITZER: Mr. Trump?TRUMP: Well, first of all, self-deportation is people are going to leave as soon as they see others going out. If you look at Dwight Eisenhower in the 1950s, they started moving people out and the rest of them left.Self-deportation, as I really define it, and thats the way I define it, is youre going to get some to go, and the rest are going to go out.As far as the people that Ive hired in various parts of Florida during the absolute prime season, like Palm Beach and other locations, you could not get help. Its the up season. People didnt want to have part-time jobs. There were part-time jobs, very seasonal, 90-day jobs, 120-day jobs, and you couldnt get.Everybody agrees with me on that. They were part-time jobs. You needed them, or we just might as well close the doors, because you couldnt get help in those hot, hot sections of Florida.RUBIO: That  my point that I made was you had criticized Mitt Romney for self-deportation. You said that his strategy of self- deportation is why he lost the election.And I think people in Florida would be surprised, because, in fact, the article that was today, they interviewed a number of people that would have been willing to do those jobs, if you would have been willing to hire them to do it.TRUMP: I criticized Mitt Romney for losing the election. He should have won that election. He had a failed president. He ran a terrible campaign. He was a terrible candidate. Thats what I criticize Mitt Romney  I mean, ran...RUBIO: No, he...TRUMP: Excuse me. He ran one terrible campaign. Thats an election that should have been won.(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: Well, in fact, I agree we should have won and I wished we would have, but, in fact, you did criticize him for using the term self-deportation. I mean, thats on the record and people can look it up right now online.But, again, I just want to reiterate, I think its really important, this point. I think its fine, its an important point that you raise and we discuss on immigration. This is a big issue for Texas, a huge issue for the country.But I also think that if youre going to claim that youre the only one that lifted this into the campaign, that you acknowledge that, for example, youre only person on this stage that has ever been fined for hiring people to work on your projects illegally.You hired some workers from Poland...TRUMP: No, no, Im the only one on the stage thats hired people. You havent hired anybody.(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: In fact, some of the people...(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: And by the way, Ive hired  and by the way, Ive hired tens of thousands of people over at my job. Youve hired nobody.RUBIO: Yes, youve hired a thousand from another country...TRUMP: Youve had nothing but problems with your credit cards, et cetera. So dont tell me about that.RUBIO: Let me just say  let me finish the statement. This is important.TRUMP: You havent hired one person, you liar.RUBIO: He hired workers from Poland. And he had to pay a million dollars or so in a judgment from...TRUMP: Thats wrong. Thats wrong. Totally wrong.RUBIO: Thats a fact. People can look it up. Im sure people are Googling it right now. Look it up. Trump Polish workers, youll see a million dollars for hiring illegal workers on one of his projects. He did it.(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: That happened.TRUMP: Ive hired tens of thousands of people over my lifetime. Tens of thousands...RUBIO: Many from other countries instead of hiring Americans.TRUMP: Be quiet. Just be quiet.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: Let me talk. Ive hired tens of thousands of people. He brings up something from 30 years ago, it worked out very well. Everybody was happy.RUBIO: You paid a million dollars.TRUMP: And by the way, the laws were totally different. That was a whole different world.BLITZER: Thank you.TRUMP: But Ive hired people. Nobody up here has hired anybody.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Senator Cruz, you say you want to deport the 11 million undocumented immigrants, but you never want to allow them to come back to the United States. What would happen to the children who are U.S.- born citizens whose parent will be deported under your plan?CRUZ: Well, existing law provides that those who are deported cannot come back here legally. U.S. citizens can come back. Thats existing law.But let me say, Wolf, I really find it amazing that Donald believes that he is the one who discovered the issue of illegal immigration. I can tell you, when I ran for Senate here in the state of Texas, I ran promising to lead the fight against amnesty, promising to fight to build a wall. And in 2013, when I was fight against the gang of eight amnesty bill, where was Donald? He was firing Dennis Rodman on Celebrity Apprentice.(LAUGHTER)CRUZ: And indeed, if you look at the gang of eight, one individual on this stage broke his promise to the men and women who elected him and wrote the amnesty bill. CRUZ: If you look at the eight members of the Gang of Eight, Donald gave over $50,000 to three Democrats and two Republicans. And when youre funding open border politicians, you shouldnt be surprised when they fight for open borders.And I think if you want to know who actually will secure the borders and follow through, you ought to ask who has a record before they were a candidate for president of fighting to secure the borders and stop amnesty. And Im the only one on this stage that has that record. And by the way, Marco is exactly right that a federal court found Donald guilty of being part of a conspiracy to hire people illegally and entered a $1 million judgment against him.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Mr. Trump?TRUMP: I can only say this, and Ive said it loud and clear and Ive said it for years. And many of these people are sitting right in the audience right now  your lobbyist and your special interest and your donors, because the audience is packed with them, and theyre packed with you.Ive had an amazing relationship with politicians  with politicians both Democrat, Republican, because I was a businessman. As one magazine said, hes a world-class businessman; he was friendly with everybody. I got along with everybody.You get along with nobody. You dont have one Republican  you dont have one Republican senator, and you work with them every day of your life, although you skipped a lot of time. These are minor details. But you dont have one Republican senator backing you; not one. You dont have the endorsement of one Republican senator and you work with these people. You should be ashamed of yourself.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Senator Cruz?CRUZ: You know, I actually think Donald is right. He is promising if hes elected he will go and cut deals in Washington. And hes right. He has supported  he has given hundreds of thousands of dollars to Democrats. Anyone who really cared about illegal immigration wouldnt be hiring illegal immigrants. Anyone who really cared about illegal immigration wouldnt be funding Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi; wouldnt be funding the Gang of Eight. And, you know, he is right. When you stand up to Washington, when you honor the promise you made to the men and women who elected you and say enough with the corruption, enough with the cronyism, lets actually stand for the working men and women of this country, Washington doesnt like it.And Donald, if you want to be liked in Washington, thats not a good attribute for a president.(APPLAUSE)(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: Heres a man  Robin Hood. This is Robin Hood over here. He talks about corruption. On his financial disclosure form, he didnt even put that hes borrowed money from Citibank and from Goldman Sachs, which is a total violation. He didnt talk about the fact that he pays almost no interest. He just left it off, and now hes going to protect the people from the big bad banks.Give me a break.BLITZER: All right. Were going to move on to Governor Kasich.Governor Kasich...(CROSSTALK)CRUZ: Wolf, can I respond to that attack?BLITZER: You can respond, but let me get Governor Kasich in. Hes been waiting patiently.Governor Kasich, the idea  youve said this, and I want to quote you now: The idea that were going to deport all these people is ludicrous and everybody knows it. Those are your words. Should people be allowed to break the law just because its not feasible to stop them?KASICH: Look, we have a great president here, George Bush, the 41st president of the United States. He worked with Ronald Reagan to pass an effort to try to solve this problem  a path to legalization. You see, that was a time when things worked. It was a time when President Reagan and George Bush decided that we needed to make the country work.Look, I think there is an answer here. The answer is you complete the border. You let people know that once its done, you dont have a right to come in. If you come in, we dont want any excuse. Youre going to go back. But I favor a guest worker program. I think its practical. And I think for the 11 million or 11.5 million Americans  the illegals that are here, if they have not committed a crime since theyve been here, Id make them pay a fine, some back taxes, maybe some community service. And at the end, Id give them a path to legalization, but not a path to citizenship. I dont think were going to tear families apart. I dont think were going to ride around in peoples neighborhoods and grab people out of their homes. I dont think  first of all, I dont think its practical and I dont think it reflects America.You know what happened? The problem with President Reagan is we didnt get in there and actually finish the border. And I think it was probably business interests that affected it. But at the end of the day, lets be practical. Lets start solving problems in this country instead of kicking them upstairs. With President Reagan and George Bush, it was a bipartisan coalition to address the issue, and I think we can and should do it again. And I will have a plan in the first 100 days to get it done and get this issue behind us.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Thank you, Governor.(APPLAUSE)Dr. Carson, youve been critical of mass deportation. You said back in November you dont think Mr. Trumps plan necessarily represents the Republican Party. Given how well Mr. Trump has been doing with the Republican primary voters, do you still believe that?CARSON: I believe in liberty and justice for all. I think everything that we do should be fair. And Ive already described  you know, how we can secure the border.We need to secure all the borders, because its not just people coming in from South America and Mexico, but there are terrorists who want to destroy us, who are getting across our borders fairly easily. And we have to stop that.But in terms of the people who are here already, after we  after we stop the illegal immigration, we need to be reasonable. And I would give them a six-month period in which to get registered as a guest worker, assuming that they have an acceptable record.They have to pay a back-tax penalty, have to pay taxes going forward, but they dont have to live underground anymore. And I think they do not become American citizens, they do not vote.If they want to become an American citizen, they go through exactly the same process that anybody else goes through. I think thats the kind of situation that is actually fair to people.And we have other ways of  of utilizing our facilities and our talents as foreign aid: doing things in South America and Central America and Mexico that improve the economy there, so that they dont feel the need to come over here. That would cost us a lot less than borrowing money from China, paying interest on it.BLITZER: Thank you, Dr. Carson.(APPLAUSE)Mr. Trump, your campaign, as you well remember, began with the idea of building a wall along the southern border.TRUMP: (inaudible).BLITZER: Its about 315 miles southwest of where we are right now. Youve said the Mexican government will pay for it.TRUMP: Correct.BLITZER: The spokesperson for the current president of Mexico says that will never happen. The last two presidents of Mexico say that will never happen. In fact, the former president of Mexico, Vicente Fox  he said today, and Im quoting him  he said, Im not going to pay for that, quote, effing wall.(LAUGHTER)So if you dont get an actual check from the Mexican government for $8 billion or $10 billion or $12 billion, whatever it will cost, how are you going to make them pay for the wall?TRUMP: I will, and the wall just got 10 feet taller, believe me.(APPLAUSE)It just got 10 feet taller. I saw him make that  I saw him make the statement. I saw him use the word that he used. I can only tell you, if I would have used even half of that word, it would have been national scandal.This guy used a filthy, disgusting word on television, and he should be ashamed of himself, and he should apologize, OK? Number one. Number two, we have a trade deficit with Mexico of $58 billion a year. And that doesnt include all the drugs that are pouring across and destroying our country.Were going to make them pay for that wall. Now, the wall is $10 billion to $12 billion, if I do it. If these guys do it, itll end up costing $200 billion.(APPLAUSE)But the wall is $10 billion to $12 billion. You need 1,000  you need 1,000 miles. The Great Wall of China, built 2,000 years ago  2,000, is 13,000 miles. We need 1,000, because we have a lot of natural barriers.We can do it for $10 billion to $12 billion, and its a real wall. This is a wall thats a heck of a lot higher than the ceiling youre looking at. This is a wall thats going to work.Mexico will pay for it, because they are not doing us any favors. They could stop all of this illegal trade if they wanted to...(BELL RINGS)... immediately. Mexico will pay for the wall. Its a small portion of the kind of money that we lose and the deficits that we have with Mexico.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: If the  if the Mexicans dont pay for the wall, will you start a trade war with Mexico?TRUMP: Well, you know, I dont mind trade wars when were losing $58 billion a year, you want to know the truth. Were losing so much. (APPLAUSE)Were losing so much with Mexico and China  with China, were losing $500 billion a year. And then people say, dont we want to trade? I dont mind trading, but I dont want to lose $500 billion. I dont want to lose $58 billion.Mexico just took Carrier Corporation, maker of air conditioners. They just took Ford. Theyre building a $2.5 billion plant. They just took Nabisco out of Chicago.And I always say Im not having Oreos anymore, which is true, by the way. But they just took a big plant from Nabisco into Mexico. Theyre taking our businesses. I dont mind.BLITZER: Thank you. Senator Rubio?(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: Yeah, a couple points. If he builds the wall the way he built Trump Towers, hell be using illegal immigrant labor to do it. The second...(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: Such a cute sound bite.RUBIO: But it  no, its not a sound bite. Its a fact. Again, go online and Google it. Donald Trump, Polish workers. Youll see it.The second thing, about the trade war  I dont understand, because your ties and the clothes you make is made in Mexico and in China. So youre gonna be starting a trade war against your own ties and your own suits.TRUMP: All right, you know what?RUBIO: Why dont you make them in America?TRUMP: Because they devalue their currency  they devalue their currencies...RUBIO: Well, then make them in America.TRUMP: ... that makes it  well, you dont know a thing about business. You lose on everything...RUBIO: Well, make them in America. TRUMP: Let me just tell you  they de-value their currency. They de-value their currencies.RUBIO: Well then, make them in America.TRUMP: That makes it  well, you dont know a thing about business. You lose on everything you do.RUBIO: Well, make them in America.TRUMP: Let me just tell you, they de-value their currencies. China, Mexico, everybody. Japan with the cars. They de-value their currencies to such an extent that our businesses cannot compete with them, our workers lose their jobs...RUBIO: And so you make them in China and in Russia.TRUMP: But you wouldnt know anything about it because youre a lousy businessman.RUBIO: Well, I dont know anything about bankrupting four companies. Youve bankrupted..TRUMP: No, I  and you know why? You know why?(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: I dont know anything about...TRUMP: You know why?RUBIO: ... starting a university, and that was a fake university.BLITZER: One at a time.TRUMP: First of all...BLITZER: One at a time.TRUMP: ... first of all, thats called a...RUBIO: There are people who borrowed $36,000...BLITZER: Hold on. One at a time, Mr. Trump.RUBIO: ... to go to Trump University, and theyre suing now  $36,000 to go to a university...TRUMP: And by the way  and by the way...RUBIO: ... thats a fake school.TRUMP: ... and by the way...RUBIO: And you know what they got? They got to take a picture with a cardboard cutout of Donald Trump...TRUMP: ... Ive won most of the lawsuits.RUBIO: Thats what they got for $36,000.BLITZER: All right, I want to move on.TRUMP: And they actually did a very good job, but Ive won most of the lawsuits.BLITZER: Mr. Trump, Senator, I want to bring in...RUBIO: Most of the lawsuits.BLITZER: ... I want to bring in my colleague Maria Celeste.TRUMP: Excuse me. Hey Wolf, let me ask you. Am I allowed to respond to this?BLITZER: Youre allowed  youve been responding.TRUMP: OK. Well let  no, I havent. I really havent.(LAUGHTER)RUBIO: Hes talked through the whole thing.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: Heres a guy  heres a guy that buys a house for $179,000, he sells it to a lobbyist whos probably here for $380,000 and then legislation is passed. You tell me about this guy. This is what were going to have as president.RUBIO: Heres a guy that inherited $200 million. If he hadnt inherited $200 million, you know where Donald Trump would be right now?TRUMP: No, no, no.RUBIO: Selling watches in (inaudible)(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: (Inaudible) I took...RUBIO: Thats where he would be. TRUMP: That is so wrong. Well work on that. I took $1 million and I turned into $10 billion.RUBIO: Oh, OK. One million.TRUMP: I borrowed $1 million...RUBIO: Better release your tax returns so we can see how much money he made.TRUMP: I borrowed $1 million, I turned it into $10 billion...RUBIO: Oh, he doesnt make that money.TRUMP: ... more than $10 billion.BLITZER: Thank you. Thank you. I want to bring in Maria Celeste of Telemundo. Maria?CELESTE: Senator Rubio, last week, you said that on your first day in office, you will get rid of President Obamas executive action known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, DACA for short.RUBIO: Correct.ARRASAS: It is a program that has protected hundreds of thousands of young people that came here when they were children, brought to the U.S. by undocumented immigrants. This is the only home they know, and that is a dramatic change from last April when you said in Spanish, and Im going to quote you (in Spanish) which translates to DACA is going to have to end at some point, but it wouldnt be fair to cancel it immediately.So Senator Rubio, what changed?RUBIO: It didnt change.ARRASAS: Why is it now fair to cancel it on Day One?RUBIO: No, its the same policy. It will have to end at some moment, and as I said, we will  we will eliminate that"
27,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/15/us/politics/transcript-democratic-presidential-debate.html,4/15/16,"Following is a transcript of the Democratic debate, as transcribed by the Federal News Service.BLITZER: Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders, you can now move to your lecterns while I explain a few ground rules. As moderator, Ill guide the discussion, asking questions and follow-ups. Youll also get questions from Dana Bash and Errol Louis. Youll each have one minute and 15 seconds to answer questions, 30 seconds for follow- ups. Timing lights will signal when your time is up. Both candidates have agreed to these rules now. Opening statements, youll each have two minutes.Lets begin with Senator Sanders.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: Wolf, thank you very much. CNN, thank you very much. Secretary Clinton, thank you very much.When we began this campaign almost a year ago, we started off at 3 percent in the polls. We were about 70 points behind Secretary Clinton. In the last couple of weeks, there were two polls out there that had us ahead.(APPLAUSE)Of the last nine caucuses and primaries, we have won eight of them, many of them by landslide victories.(APPLAUSE)Over the last year, we have received almost 7 million individual campaign contributions, averaging  guess what  $27 apiece, more individual campaign contributions than any candidate in American history at this point in a campaign.The reason that our campaign has done so well is because were doing something very radical: Were telling the American people the truth. And the truth is that this country is not going to move forward in a significant way for working people unless we overturn this disastrous Citizens United Supreme Court decision...(APPLAUSE)... and unless we have real campaign reform so that billionaires and super PACs cannot buy elections.(APPLAUSE)This campaign is also determined to end a rigged economy where the rich get richer and everybody else get poorer, and create an economy that works for all of us, not just the 1 percent.Thank you.BLITZER: Secretary Clinton? CLINTON: Well, first of all, its great to be here in New York, and I am delighted to...(APPLAUSE)... have this chance to discuss the issues that are important to our future. I was so honored to serve as a senator from New York for eight years...(APPLAUSE)... and to work to provide opportunity for all of our citizens to make it possible that we could knock down the barriers that stand in the way of people getting ahead and staying ahead.And during those eight years, we faced some difficult challenges together. We faced 9/11. We worked hard to rebuild New York. I was particularly concerned about our first responders and others whod been affected in their health by what they had experienced. We worked hard to bring jobs from Buffalo to Albany and all parts of New York to give more hard-working people a chance to really make the most out of their own talents.And we worked hard to really keep New York values at the center of who we are and what we do together.(APPLAUSE)And that is  that is exactly what I want to do as your president. We will celebrate our diversity. We will work together, bringing us back to being united, setting some big, bold, progressive goals for America. Thats what Im offering in this campaign, to build on the work, to build on the value that we share here in New York, to take those to Washington, and to knock down those barriers that in any way hold back not only individual Americans, bur our country from reaching our full potential. That is what my campaign is about.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Thank you, Secretary.We are going to deal with many of the issues both of you just raised. I want to begin with a question that goes right to the heart of which one of you should be the Democratic presidential nominee.BLITZER: Senator Sanders, in the last week, youve raised questions about Secretary Clintons qualifications to be president. You said that something is clearly lacking in terms of her judgment and you accused her of having a credibility gap.So let me ask you, do you believe that Secretary Clinton has the judgment to be president?SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (D-VT), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, Ive known Secretary Clinton, how long, 25 years?We worked together in the Senate. And I said that in response to the kind of attacks we were getting from the Clinton, uh, campaign. Washington Post headline says Clinton Campaign says Sanders is Unqualified and thats what the surrogates were saying.Does Secretary Clinton have the experience and the intelligence to be a president?Of course she does.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: But I do question...(APPLAUSE)SANDERS:  but I do question her judgment. I question a judgment which voted for the war in Iraq...(APPLAUSE)SANDERS:  the worst foreign policy blunder in the history of this country, voted for virtually every disastrous trade agreement which cost us millions of decent-paying jobs. And I question her judgment about running super PACs which are collecting tens of millions of dollars from special interests, including $15 million from Wall Street.I dont believe that that is...(APPLAUSE)SANDERS:  the kind of judgment we need to be the kind of president we need.BLITZER: Secretary Clinton?HILLARY CLINTON (D-NY), FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:Well, it is true that now that the spotlight is pretty bright here in New York, some things have been said and Senator Sanders did call me unqualified. Ive been called a lot of things in my life. That was a first.(LAUGHTER)CLINTON: And then he did say that...(APPLAUSE)CLINTON:  he had to question my judgment. Well, the people of New York voted for me twice to be their senator from New York and...(APPLAUSE)CLINTON:  and...(APPLAUSE)CLINTON:  and President Obama trusted my judgment enough to ask me to be secretary of State for the United States.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: So, look, we have disagreements on policy. Theres no doubt about it. But if you go and read, which I hope all of you will before Tuesday, Senator Sanders long interview with the New York Daily News, talk about judgment and talk about the kinds of problems he had answering questions about even his core issue, breaking up the banks.When asked, he could not explain how...(LAUGHTER)CLINTON:  that would be done and...(APPLAUSE)CLINTON:  when asked...(APPLAUSE)CLINTON:  when asked about a number of foreign policy issues, he could not answer about Afghanistan, about Israel, about counterterrorism, except to say if hed had some paper in front of him, maybe he could.I think you need to have the judgment on day one to be both president and commander-in-chief.BLITZER: Senator...(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: And lets talk about judgment.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes!(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: And let us talk about the worst foreign policy blunder in the modern history of this country...(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: I led the opposition to that war. Secretary Clinton voted for that. Well, lets talk about judgment. Lets talk about super PACs and 501(c)(4)s, money which is completely undisclosed.Where does the money come from?Do we really feel confident about a candidate saying that shes going to bring change in America when she is so dependent on big money interests?I dont think so.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: Well, let me...SANDERS: We have...CLINTON:  let me just say...SANDERS:  (INAUDIBLE)...CLINTON:  let me  let me say...BLITZER: Madam Secretary, let him finish.CLINTON: OK.SANDERS: Thirdly, we have got to understand that in America, we should be thinking big, not small.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Thank you.SANDERS: We need to join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee health care to all people. So I...(APPLAUSE)SANDERS:  my (INAUDIBLE).BLITZER: Thank you, Senator.Secretary?CLINTON: Well, make  make no mistake about it, this is not just an attack on me, its an attack on President Obama. President Obama...(BOOS)CLINTON: You know, let me tell you why. You may not like the answer, but Ill tell you why. President Obama had a super PAC when he ran. President Obama took tens of millions of dollars from contributors. And President Obama was not at all influenced when he made the decision to pass and sign Dodd-Frank, the toughest regulations...(APPLAUSE)CLINTON:  on Wall Street in many a year.CLINTON: So this is  this is a phony  this is a phony attack that is designed to raise questions when there is no evidence or support, to undergird the continuation that he is putting forward in these attacks.BLITZER: Thank, Secretary. Were going to continue on this, but I want Dana Bash to continue with the questioning.BASH: Secretary Clint, the government announced yesterday that five of the biggest banks on Wall Street have failed to develop plans to dismantle themselves in the event of another financial crisis. This is the second time in two years those banks neglected to come up with credible plans. So, as president, would you call on regulators to start the process of breaking up these banks? Something that the law not only allows, but actually explicitly encourages?CLINTON: Absolutely. You know, this is what Ive saying for the past year. No bank is too big to fail, no executive too powerful to jail.I have been talking about what we should be doing under Dodd- Frank. Im glad that Senator Sanders is now joining in talking about Dodd-Frank, because Dodd-Frank sets forth the approach that needs to be taken. I believe, and I will appoint regulators who are tough enough and ready enough to break up any bank that fails the test under Dodd-Frank.There are two sections there. If they fail either one, that theyre a systemic risk, a grave risk to our economy, or if they fail the other, that their living wills, which is what youre referring to, is inadequate.Lets look at what is at stake here. We can never let Wall Street wreck Main street again. I spoke out against Wall Street when I was a Senator from New York. I have been standing up and saying continuously we have the law. Weve got to execute under it. So, youre right. I will move immediately to break up any financial institution, but I go further because I want the law to extend to those that are part of the shadow banking industry. The big insurance companies, the hedge funds, something that I have been arguing for now a long time...BASH: ... Thank you, Secretary. Senator Sanders, you were recently asked what you would replace the big Wall Street banks with if you could break them up. You said, quote, Thats their decision.Why would you trust the banks to restructure themselves? SANDERS: First, Dana...BASH: when you said the whole business model was fraudulent?SANDERS: Thats right. So, lets start off with the basic premise. A few days ago Goldman Sachs formally reached a settlement with the United States government for $5 billion dollars. What Goldman Sachs acknowledged was, essentially, that they were selling fraudulent packages of subprime mortgage loans.Goldman Sachs was not the only bank, other banks, of course, did the same. Now, I dont need Dodd-Frank now to tell me that we have got to break up these banks, A, because theyre based on fraudulent principles, and B, because when you have six financial institutions that have assets equivalent to 58% of the GFP of this country, they are just too big, too much concentration of wealth and power.BASH: But, Senator...SANDERS: The point is we have got to break them up so that they do not pose a systemic risk and so that we have a vibrant economy with a competitive financial system.BASH: But Senator, you didnt answer the specific question which is not just about breaking up the banks, but why allow the banks to do it themselves?SANDERS: Because Im not sure that the government should say is you are too big to fail. Youve got to be a certain size. And, then the banks themselves can figure out what they want to sell off. I dont know that its appropriate that the Department of Treasury to be making those decisions. What we need is to make sure that they are safe.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: Dana, you know  I love being in Brooklyn.(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)CLINTON: Dana, let me add here that there are two ways to at this under Dodd-Frank, which is after all the law we passed under President Obama, and Im proud that Barney Frank, one of the authors, has endorsed me because what I have said continuously is, yes, sometimes the government may have to order certain actions. Sometime the government can permit the institution themselves to take those actions. That has to be the judgement of the regulators.But, theres another element to this. I believe strongly that executives of any of these organizations should be financially penalized if there is a settlement.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: They should have to pay up through compensation or bonuses because we have to go after not just the big giant institution, we have got to go after the people who are making the decisions in the institutions.BASH: Thank you, Madam Secretary.CLINTON: And hold them accountable as well.(APPLAUSE)BASH: Senator Sanders, you have consistently criticized Secretary Clinton for accepting money from Wall Street. Can you name one decision that she made as senator that shows that he favored banks because of the money she received?SANDERS: Sure. Sure. The obvious decision is when the greed and recklessness and illegal behavior of wall street brought this country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Recession  the Great Depression of the 30s, when millions of people lost their jobs, and their homes, and their life savings, the obvious response to that is that youve got a bunch of fraudulent operators and that they have got to be broken up.That was my view way back, and I introduced legislation to do that. Now, Secretary Clinton was busy giving speeches to Goldman Sachs for $225,000 a speech.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: So the problem response  the proper response in my view is we should break them up. And thats what my legislation does.CLINTON: Well, you can tell, Dana, he cannot come up with any example, because there is no example.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: It is important  its always important. It may be inconvenient, but its always important to get the facts straight. I stood up against the behaviors of the banks when I was a senator.I called them out on their mortgage behavior. I also was very willing to speak out against some of the special privileges they had under the tax code. When I went to the secretary of state office, the president  President Obama led the effort to pass the Dodd-Frank bill.That is the law. Now, this is our ninth debate. In the prior eight debates, I have said, we have a law. You dont just say, were upset about this. Im upset about it. You dont just say, go break them up. You have a law, because we are a nation of laws.BASH: Thank you, Madam Secretary.CLINTON: So I support Dodd-Frank, but I have consistently said thats not enough. Weve got to include the shadow banking sector.BASH: Thank you. Senator Sanders.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: Secretary Clinton called them out. Oh my goodness, they must have been really crushed by this. And was that before or after you received huge sums of money by giving speaking engagements? So they must have been very, very upset by what you did.Look, here is the difference and here is the clear difference. These banks, in my view, have too much power. They have shown themselves to be fraudulent organizations endangering the well-being of our economy.If elected president, I will break them up. We have got legislation to do that, end of discussion.(APPLAUSE)BASH: Secretary Clinton, if I may, Senator Sanders keeping bringing up the speeches that you gave to Goldman Sachs. So Id like to ask you, so youve said that you dont want to release the transcripts, until everybody does it, but if theres nothing in those speeches that you think would change voters minds, why not just release the transcripts and put this whole issue to bed?(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: You know, first of all  first of all, there isnt an issue. When I was in public service serving as the senator from New York, I did stand up to the banks. I did make it clear that their behavior would not be excused.Im the only one on this stage who did not vote to deregulate swaps and derivatives, as Senator Sanders did, which led to a lot of the problems that we had with Lehman Brothers.Now, if youre going to look at the problems that actually caused the Great Recession, youve got to look at the whole picture. It was a giant insurance company, AIG. It was an investment bank, Lehman Brothers. It was mortgage companies like Countrywide.Im not saying that Senator Sanders did something untoward when he voted to deregulate swaps and derivatives...BASH: Madam Secretary...CLINTON: ... but the fact is he did.CLINTON: And that contributed to the collapse of Lehman Brothers and started the cascade...(APPLAUSE)(CROSSTALK)BASH: Senator Sanders, one second, please. Secretary Clinton, the question was about the transcripts of the speeches to Goldman Sachs.(APPLAUSE)Why not release them?CLINTON: I have said, look, there are certain  there are certain expectations when you run for president. This is a new one. And Ive said, if everybody agrees to do it  because there are speeches for money on the other side. I know that.But I will tell you this, there is  there is a long-standing expectation that everybody running release their tax returns, and you can go  you can go to my website and see eight years of tax returns. And Ive released 30 years of tax returns. And I think every candidate, including Senator Sanders and Donald Trump, should do the same.(APPLAUSE)BASH: Secretary Clinton, were going to get to the tax returns later, but just to put a button on this, youre running now for the Democratic nomination.CLINTON: Right.BASH: And it is your Democratic opponent and many Democratic voters who want to see those transcripts. Its not about the Republicans...(CROSSTALK)(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: You know, lets set the same standard for everybody. When everybody does it, OK, I will do it, but lets set and expect the same standard on tax returns. Everybody does it, and then we move forward.BLITZER: Thank you.SANDERS: Well, let me respond. Secretary Clinton, you just heard her, everybody else does it, shell do it. I will do it.(APPLAUSE)I am going to release all of the transcripts of the speeches that I gave on Wall Street behind closed doors, not for $225,000, not for $2,000, not for two cents. There were no speeches.(APPLAUSE)And second of all, of course we will release our taxes. Jane does our taxes. Weve been a little bit busy lately. Youll excuse us. But we will...BLITZER: Senator...SANDERS: We will get them out.BLITZER: Senator...CLINTON: Well, you know, there are a lot of copy machines around.BLITZER: Senator, when are you  when are you  youve been asked for weeks and weeks to release your tax returns.SANDERS: Well, I think we got one thats coming out tomorrow.BLITZER: Which one?SANDERS: Last years.BLITZER: 2014?SANDERS: Yes.BLITZER: What about 2013, all the other ones?SANDERS: Youll get them, yes. Yeah, look, I dont want to get anybody very excited. They are very boring tax returns. No big money from speeches, no major investments. Unfortunately  unfortunately, I remain one of the poorer members of the United States Senate. And thats what that will show.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: So, Senator, just to be clear, tomorrow you will release the 2014 tax returns from you and your family?SANDERS: Yes.BLITZER: And what about the earlier ones? Whats the problem... SANDERS: Yes.BLITZER: Whats taking so long? Because you just have to go to the filing cabinet, make a copy, and release them.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: Wolf, the answer is, you know, what we have always done in my family is, Jane does them. And shes been out on the campaign trail. We will get them out. Well get them out very shortly. Its not a big deal.BLITZER: Thank you. Senator, Senator, youve slammed companies like General Electric and Verizon for moving jobs outside of the United States. Yesterday, the CEO of Verizon called your views contemptable and said in your home state of Vermont Verizon has invested more than $16 million and pays millions of dollars a year to local businesses. He says you are, quote, uninformed on this issue and disconnected from reality. Given your obvious contempt for large American corporations, how would you as president of the United States be able to effectively promote American businesses around the world?SANDERS: Well, for a start, I would tell the gentleman whos the CEO at Verizon to start negotiating with the Communication Workers of America.(APPLAUSE)And this is  this is a perfect example, Wolf, of the kind of corporate greed which is destroying the middle class of this country. This gentleman makes $18 million a year in salary. Thats his  thats his compensation. This gentleman is now negotiating to take away health care benefits of Verizon workers, outsource call center jobs to the Philippines, and  and trying to create a situation where workers will lose their jobs. He is not investing in the way he should in inner cities in America.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: All right. Senator, but the question was, the question was, given your contempt for large American corporations, as president, how would you be able to promote American business around the world?SANDERS: First of all, the word contempt is not right. There are some great businesses who treat their workers and the environment with respect.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: Verizon happens not to be one of them.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: And what we need to do is to tell this guy Immelt, whos the head of General Electric, he doesnt like me, well, thats fine. He has outsourced hundreds of thousands of decent-paying jobs throughout the world...(APPLAUSE)SANDERS:  cut his workforce here substantially and in a given year, by the way, it turns out that both Verizon and General Electric, in a given year, pay nothing in federal income tax despite making billions in profits.(BOOS)BLITZER: But Senator, experts say that no matter the means to bring back these jobs to the United States, prices of goods for consumers in the United States would go up, which would disproportionately impact the poor and middle class.So how do you bring back these jobs to the United States without affecting the cost of goods to Americas middle class and poor?SANDERS: Well, for a start, were going to raise the minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: And number two, while it is true we may end up paying a few cents more for a hamburger in McDonalds, at the end of the day, what this economy desperately needs is to rebuild our manufacturing sector with good-paying jobs.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: We cannot continue to sustain the loss of millions of decent-paying jobs that we have seen over the last 20, 30 years, based on trade agreements of which Secretary Clinton has voted for almost every one of those. That has got to change.BLITZER: Thank you.Secretary...(LAUGHTER)BLITZER:  Secretary Clinton?(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: Well, first of all, I do have a very comprehensive plan to create more jobs and I think that has to be at the center of our economic approach. And so I think it is important that we do more on manufacturing. I went to Syracuse and laid out a $10 billion plan that would, I believe, really jump-start advanced manufacturing.I have seen the results of what can happen when we have the government cooperating with business. And thats exactly what I will do.When I was secretary of State, I helped to lead the way to increased exports of American good around the world, which supports tens of thousands of jobs.So I think youve got to go at this with a sense of how to accomplish the goal we are setting  more good jobs with rising incomes for people everywhere from inner cities to rural areas to every distressed community in America. And thats exactly what my plan would bring about.I think we have a pretty good record if we look at what happened...BLITZER: Senator...CLINTON:  in the 1990s, we got 23 million new jobs and incomes went up for everybody.BLITZER: Thank you.CLINTON: Lets do that again in America.BLITZER: Senator, how do you...SANDERS: Im going to respond...BLITZER: Ill have you respond in a moment.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Stand by.SANDERS: Well, look...BLITZER: Secretary Clinton... (CROSSTALK)BLITZER: You will respond in a moment, but I have to follow-up with Secretary Clinton.You stood on the stage with Governor Cuomo in support of new legislation to raise New Yorks minimum wage to $15 an hour. But you do not support raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour.As president...(APPLAUSE)BLITZER:  if a Democratic Congress put a $15 minimum wage bill on your desk, would you sign it?CLINTON: Well, of course I would. And I have supported...(APPLAUSE)CLINTON:  I have supported the fight for 15. I am proud to have the endorsement of most of the unions that have led the fight for 15. I was proud to stand on the stage with Governor Cuomo, with SEIU and others who have been leading this battle and I will work as hard as I can to raise the minimum wage. I always have. I supported that when I was in the Senate.SANDERS: Well, look...CLINTON: But what I have also said is that weve got to be smart about it, just the way Governor Cuomo was here in New York. If you look at it, we moved more quickly to $15 in New York City, more deliberately toward $12, $12.50 upstate then to $15. That is exactly my position. Its a model for the nation and thats what I will do as president.BLITZER: Thank you.CLINTON: Go as quickly as...(CROSSTALK)CLINTON:  to get to $15.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: I am sure a lot of people are very surprised to learn that you supported raising the minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: You know, wait a minute...SANDERS: (INAUDIBLE).CLINTON:  wait a minute. SANDERS: (INAUDIBLE).CLINTON:  wait, wait...SANDERS: Thats just not accurate. Well...CLINTON: Come on, I have stood on the debate stage...SANDERS:  well and I...CLINTON:  with Senator Sanders eight...(CROSSTALK)CLINTON:  times.SANDERS: Excuse me.CLINTON: I have said the...SANDERS: Well...CLINTON: Exact same thing.BLITZER: Secretary, Senator, please.CLINTON: If we can...(CROSSTALK)CLINTON:  raise it to $15 in New York...(CROSSTALK)CLINTON:  or Los Angeles or Seattle...BLITZER: Secretary, the viewers...CLINTON:  lets do it.BLITZER: If youre both screaming at each other, the viewers wont be able to hear either of you.SANDERS: OK.BLITZER: So please...SANDERS: I will...BLITZER:  dont talk over each other.SANDERS: I believe I was...(CROSSTALK)BLITZER: Go ahead.SANDERS:  responding.All right? When this campaign began, I said that we got to end the starvation minimum wage of $7.25, raise it to $15. Secretary Clinton said lets raise it to $12. Theres a difference. And, by the way, what has happened is history has outpaced Secretary Clinton, because all over this country, people are standing up and theyre saying $12 is not good enough, we need $15 an hour.CLINTON: OK.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Go ahead, Secretary. Secretary?SANDERS: And suddenly...BLITZER: Secretary, go ahead.SANDERS: To suddenly...CLINTON: Thank you. Thank you very much.SANDERS: To suddenly announce now that youre for $15, I dont think is quite accurate.BLITZER: All right. Secretary?CLINTON: All right. I have said from the very beginning that I supported the fight for $15. I supported those on the front lines of the fight for  it happens to be true. I also  I supported the $15 effort in L.A. I supported in Seattle. I supported it for the fast food workers in New York.The minimum wage at the national level right now is $7.25, right? We want to raise it higher than it ever has been, but we also have to recognize some states and some cities will go higher, and I support that. I have taken my cue from the Democrats in the Senate, led by Senator Patty Murray and others, like my good friend Kirsten Gillibrand, who has said we will set a national level of $12 and then urge any place that can go above it to go above it.Going from $7.25 to $12 is a huge difference. Thirty-five million people will get a raise. One in four working mothers will get a raise. I want to get something done. And I think setting the goal to get to $12 is the way to go, encouraging others to get to $15. But, of course, if we have a Democratic Congress, we will go to $15.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Senator, go ahead.SANDERS: Well, I think the secretary has confused a lot of people. I dont know how youre there for the fight for $15 when you say you want a $12-an-hour national minimum wage.(APPLAUSE)Now, in fact  in fact, there is an effort, Patty Murray has introduced legislation for $12 minimum wage. Thats good. I introduced legislation for $15 an hour minimum wage which is better.(APPLAUSE)And ultimately what we have got to determine is after massive transfer of wealth from the middle class to the top 0.1 percent, when millions of our people are working longer hours for low wages...BLITZER: Thank you, Senator.SANDERS: I think we have got to be clear, not equivocate, $15 in minimum wage in 50 states in this country as soon as possible.BLITZER: Thank you.(APPLAUSE)Were going to turn to another critically important issue right now, guns in America. Secretary Clinton, youve said that Vermont, Senator Sanders home state, has, quote, the highest per capita number of guns that end up committing crimes in New York. But only 1.2 percent of the guns recovered in New York in 2014 were from Vermont. Are you seriously blaming Vermont, and implicitly Senator Sanders, for New Yorks gun violence?CLINTON: No, of course not. Of course not. This is  this is a serious difference between us.(LAUGHTER)And what I want to start by saying  its not a laughing matter  90 people on average a day are killed or commit suicide or die in accidents from guns, 33,000 people a year. I take it really seriously, because I have spent more time than I care to remember being with people who have lost their loved ones.So, yes, we have a problem in America. We need a president who will stand up against the gun lobby. We need a president who will fight for commonsense gun safety reforms.(APPLAUSE)And what we have here is a big difference. Senator Sanders voted against the Brady Bill five times. He voted for the most important NRA priority, namely giving immunity from liability to gun-makers and dealers, something that is at the root of a lot of the problems that we are facing.Then he doubled down on that in the New York Daily News interview, when asked whether he would support the Sandy Hook parents suing to try to do something to rein in the advertising of the AR-15, which is advertised to young people as being a combat weapon, killing on the battlefield. He said they didnt deserve their day in court.CLINTON: I could not disagree more.And, finally, this is the only industry in America, the only one.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: That has this kind of special protection. We hear a lot from Senator Sanders about the greed and recklessness of Wall Street, and I agree. Weve got to hold Wall Street accountable...BLITZER: ... Thank you...CLINTON: ... Well, what about the greed and recklessness of gun manufacturers and dealers in America?(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)BLITZER: Senator? Well, the only problem is, Wolf, she didnt answer your question.You asked her whether she thought that Vermont was responsible. You asked her whether she thought that Vermont was responsible for a lot of the gun violence. You made the point what she said was totally absurd.BLITZER: I asked her, are you seriously blaming Vermont and implicitly Senator Sanders for New Yorks gun violence. She said no. But, go ah"
28,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/19/us/politics/driven-by-campaign-populism-democrats-unite-on-expanding-social-security.html,6/19/16,"WASHINGTON  President Obama, Hillary Clinton and other Democrats are rallying around proposals to expand Social Security and increase benefits, a sea change after three decades dominated by concern over the programs rising costs.The Democrats new consensus was driven by the populist election-year politics of Senator Bernie Sanders and by a realization that many workers have neither traditional pensions nor any significant retirement savings.Mr. Sanders campaigned hard on promises to expand Social Security. Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, helped set the tone as well, breaking with Republican orthodoxy by vowing not to cut Social Security benefits. That position puts him potentially at odds with Republican lawmakers eager to rein in entitlement programs, though an aide has suggested that he might be flexible on the issue.The Democrats proposals would amount to the biggest changes in Social Security since 1983, when the program faced a financial crisis and Congress enacted measures recommended by a bipartisan commission headed by Alan Greenspan. To save the program, spending was trimmed, taxes were raised and the eligibility age was set to increase slowly as the population ages.Since then, many Republicans and some Democrats have expressed concern about the growing cost of entitlement programs, including those for retiring baby boomers, and have discussed proposals to trim Social Security further.Social Security is going broke, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan has declared.In budget negotiations in 2011 and 2012, Mr. Obama seriously considered proposals to curtail future Social Security benefits by changing the way cost-of-living increases were calculated. He included a similar proposal in his budget request in early 2013, in an unsuccessful effort to achieve a bipartisan agreement on deficit reduction.The calculations that drove those efforts have not changed. In their last report, in July 2015, the trustees of Social Security, including four administration officials, said the programs old-age and disability insurance trust funds could be depleted in 2034, and could then pay just 79 percent of promised benefits unless Congress took action.But the politics have shifted. Mr. Obama summarized the new Democratic consensus in a speech in Elkhart, Ind., on June 1.Its time we finally made Social Security more generous, and increased its benefits so that todays retirees and future generations get the dignified retirement that theyve earned, Mr. Obama said. And we could start paying for it by asking the wealthiest Americans to contribute a little bit more.Democrats appear likely to include those proposals in their platform. Senator Sanders, working with other progressives, has transformed the debate, so that expanding Social Security is today a central and consensus tenet of the Democratic Party, Nancy J. Altman, the president of Social Security Works, an advocacy group, said at a hearing of the platform-drafting committee on June 9.Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas and chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said the Democrats stance was not a surprise. Whenever theres a problem with a federal program, Mr. Brady said, the presidents answer is to raise taxes and throw more money at it.Mr. Sanders has long pushed for the expansion of Social Security and made that a major theme of his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. The partys new consensus gave Mr. Sanders reason to crow.A few years ago we were told that the debate on Social Security was not whether we were going to cut it, but by how much, said Warren Gunnels, the policy director for the Sanders campaign. Many of us stood up and fought back.Now, he said, after Mr. Obamas remarks this month in Indiana, we are all unified as Democrats, and the issue is not whether were going to expand Social Security, but how much were going to expand it.Sixty million people receive Social Security benefits totaling more than $74 billion each month. So even small changes can have big implications.At one point, just before the New Hampshire primary in February, Mr. Sanders challenged Mrs. Clintons record on Social Security and suggested that she might support increasing the age at which people become eligible for full retirement benefits. (That age, originally set at 65, increases gradually and is already scheduled to reach 67 for people born after 1959.)Responding immediately on Twitter, Mrs. Clinton denounced the comments as false innuendos and promised: I wont cut Social Security. As always, Ill defend it, & Ill expand it.Specifically, Mrs. Clinton says, she would increase benefits for widows and those who take time out of the paid work force to care for a child or a sick family member. She would require the wealthiest Americans to contribute more through higher taxes. And she says she would fight efforts to privatize Social Security, reduce annual cost-of-living adjustments or increase the age for collecting full retirement benefits.Mr. Obama highlighted other reasons for the Democrats renewed focus on Social Security. A lot of Americans dont have retirement savings, he said, and fewer people have pensions they can really count on.More than 110 House Democrats  out of 188 total  have endorsed a resolution supporting policies to protect and expand Social Security.Democrats have offered a number of proposals to alter the formula for calculating Social Security benefits or financing the program, but have not endorsed a specific legislative package. One proposal would increase benefits for everyone, with extra help for those considered most vulnerable. Another would increase the cost-of-living adjustment to reflect the fact that older Americans tend to use more health care services. Another proposal would impose payroll taxes on workers earnings above $250,000 a year.In the Senate, Democrats are digging in against a Republican nominated by Mr. Obama to serve a second term as a public trustee of Social Security, a watchdog over the finances of the program. Democrats say the nominee, Charles P. Blahous III, who served as a trustee from 2010 to 2015, has undermined public confidence in the program by exaggerating its financial problems. He was an architect of President George W. Bushs failed plan to let people put some of their payroll taxes into personal retirement accounts.Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, described Mr. Blahous as an anti-government zealot. Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, said, Mr. Blahous has shown over the course of his academic career that he is personally ideologically opposed to the fundamental promise of Social Security.Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah and chairman of the Finance Committee, dismissed the criticism of Mr. Blahous as partisan rants meant to whip up support and help raise money for Democrats in an election year.This firestorm is about politics, pure and simple, Mr. Hatch said.By a vote of 14 to 12 on June 8, the Finance Committee recommended the confirmation of Mr. Blahous, over the objections of all Democrats on the panel.The trustees supervise the preparation of a detailed annual report on the financial outlook for Social Security and Medicare. The reports are trusted and frequently cited by members of both parties, including Mr. Ryan, who has called the explosion of entitlement spending the greatest threat to our nations long-term economic prosperity.Mr. Trump may have opened a fissure in his party, just as Democrats unite. He assured Iowa voters in December that were not going to cut your Social Security, and at a Republican debate in March, he said, I will do everything within my power not to touch Social Security, to leave it the way it is.But in his 2000 book, The America We Deserve, Mr. Trump referred to Social Security as a huge Ponzi scheme, suggested raising the age for full benefits to 70 and said, Privatization would be good for all of us."
29,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/04/nyregion/last-atlantic-city-casino-linked-to-trump-is-closing-amid-a-strike.html,8/4/16,"The last of the Atlantic City casinos once operated by Donald J. Trump is set to close early next month.The Trump Taj Mahal, which has been picketed since July 1 by hundreds of striking employees, will shut its doors for good after Labor Day, the casinos management announced on Wednesday. The Taj, which Mr. Trump heralded as the eighth wonder of the world when it opened in 1990, would be the fifth casino in the city to close in less than three years.The company that manages the Taj blamed the striking workers for blocking the casinos path to profitability. But the president of their union, Bob McDevitt of Unite Here Local 54, said the casinos owner, Carl C. Icahn, was willing to burn the Trump Taj Mahal down to punish the strikers.Mr. Icahn acquired the Taj last year after its parent company, Trump Entertainment Resorts, filed for bankruptcy protection. Mr. Trump, who is now the Republican nominee for president, has not had a stake in the Taj since its parent company emerged from the bankruptcy proceedings. Tropicana Entertainment has been managing the Taj, as well as the Tropicana, another of the eight remaining casinos in Atlantic City.Tony Rodio, the chief executive of Tropicana Entertainment, said in a statement that Icahn Enterprises had lost almost $100 million trying to save the Taj. Currently, the Taj is losing multimillions a month, and now with this strike, we see no path to profitability, he said.Mr. Rodio said the company planned to send the casinos employees official notices this week about its intention to close after the Labor Day weekend.In an angry response, Mr. McDevitt said Mr. Icahn had refused to negotiate with the workers, who were demanding health insurance and other benefits similar to what other casinos in Atlantic City have promised the unions members. Local 54 had authorized strikes at five casinos this summer, but the union reached agreements with the others.Two weeks ago, union leaders rejected the latest offer from Mr. Icahn, and about 1,000 Taj workers remained on strike. Before the strike, Mr. Icahn had promised to invest $100 million to renovate the Taj, which has lost much of the luster it had when it was Mr. Trumps crown jewel.For a few million bucks, he could have had labor peace and a content work force, Mr. McDevitt said of Mr. Icahn in a statement, but instead hed rather slam the door shut on these long-term workers just to punish them and attempt to break their strike. In the end, hell have to live with what hes done to working people in Atlantic City.The workers on strike include cooks, bartenders and room cleaners. The Taj has remained open through the strike because its managers and the dealers on the casino floor are not members of Unite Here. All told, a shutdown would eliminate nearly 3,000 jobs.Already, the seaside resort has lost about 8,000 jobs as casinos in neighboring states lured gamblers away. The industrys annual revenue has been cut in half  a drop of more than $2.5 billion  in the past nine years. In 2014, four casinos  the Atlantic Club, Revel, Showboat and Trump Plaza  shut their doors.With the loss of so much tax revenue, the citys government has been struggling to avert its own bankruptcy. In late May, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, a Republican, and legislative leaders in Trenton negotiated a bailout package intended to keep the city afloat for five months while local leaders try to balance the municipal budget. That package included a $74 million loan from the state."
30,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/12/us/politics/congress-affordable-care-act.html,1/12/17,"WASHINGTON  The House is expected to give final approval on Friday to a measure that would allow Republicans to speedily gut the Affordable Care Act with no threat of a Senate filibuster, a move that would thrust the question of what health law would come next front and center even before President-elect Donald J. Trump takes office.The House vote would come after the Senate narrowly approved the same measure, a budget blueprint, early Thursday morning. Americans woke up Thursday to the realization that a Republican Congress was serious about repealing President Obamas signature domestic achievement  a move that could leave 20 million Americans unsure of their health coverage and millions more wondering if protections offered by the Affordable Care Act could soon be taken away.This is a critical step forward, the first step toward bringing relief from this failed law, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, said.Democrats said the rush to repeal was the height of legislative irresponsibility and would endanger the health of millions.For the life of me, I cant understand the need to take health care away from people, and why in the world anybody would even contemplate doing that without something to replace it, said Representative Louise M. Slaughter of New York. Just snatching it out from under them and its gone. I think that theres going to be a mighty rumble in this country, an outburst of anger and fear.What comes next may be the most pressing problem facing Republicans, who may find that dismantling the health law is far easier than replacing it with one that can unite their fractious members  and win over some Democrats.After a marathon session, the Senate voted 51 to 48 to approve a budget measure that would clear the way for the health care law to be repealed with a simple Senate majority. As the House approached its vote, some Republicans remained reluctant to act without a clear strategy to replace the health law.Wed like to see a little more flesh on the bone before we sign on the dotted line, said Representative Andy Harris of Maryland, an anesthesiologist and a member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus.Republicans skeptical of moving forward risked looking hostile to the repeal effort. And there was a prevailing sense of the importance of following through on a campaign promise upon which so many House Republicans had staked their political reputations.This is an issue that really and truly, in some ways, put two-thirds of our conference here, said Representative Doug Collins of Georgia, a member of the partys leadership team.Everybody wants to get it right, he said.Republican leaders sought to reassure members that the House budget vote  procedurally important as it is  is only the first step in an exhaustive process to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. Four committees in the House and Senate would then be tasked with drafting the legislation that would gut the existing health law.The concerns fostered a remarkable alignment between some centrist Republicans and their counterparts in the House Freedom Caucus, the hard-right group that is disposed to disagree with its own partys leaders.Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin worked to soothe concerns even as he expressed the urgent need to get rid of a law that Republicans hate. Republicans would embark on a thoughtful, step-by-step process, he said, even though the law is collapsing while we speak.Mr. Ryan also said he was working with Mr. Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence. Mr. Trump called this week for a near simultaneous repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act.We are in complete sync, Mr. Ryan said.But Republicans face a significant challenge in passing the necessary legislation to replace the health care law. They can repeal major parts of the existing law without facing a filibuster, but they would not be able put in place a full replacement in the same measure, because arcane budget rules limit what can be included in such a filibuster-proof bill.Instead, they would almost certainly need to pass another bill or multiple bills with 60 Senate votes, and that would require at least some Democratic cooperation.Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, a prime target for Republican wooing, asserted on Thursday that Mr. Trump did not want to repeal Obamacare but repair it. He cited Mr. Trumps stated support for popular provisions like requiring insurers to provide coverage for people with pre-existing medical conditions.Were in a repair mode, Mr. Manchin said. They need 60 votes to repair. Im actually happy to work with them.Republicans in Congress have offered many replacement ideas, but it is not clear whether their most conservative members will ever be able to agree on legislation acceptable to the partys moderates.A manifesto issued by House Republicans in June outlined a consensus proposal, produced by the chairmen of four House committees, including Representative Tom Price of Georgia, chosen by Mr. Trump to be secretary of health and human services.Mr. Trump and congressional leaders said they were counting on Mr. Price to help them write a replacement for the Affordable Care Act, most likely drawing from a bill that he introduced in July 2009 and has reintroduced several times since.I think theres an acknowledgment both by the administration coming in and people around here that his imprint needs to be on this, Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, said.Senate Republicans do not have a detailed plan. But Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, chairman of the health committee, laid out a road map on the Senate floor this week that pointed to a measure potentially more expansive than House plans.The major Republican proposals have not been analyzed by the Congressional Budget Office, so no independent or authoritative estimates exist of their costs or the number of people who might gain or lose coverage.On several points, the major Republican proposals agree.They would eliminate the requirements that most Americans carry health insurance and that larger employers offer it to employees.They would offer tax credits for health insurance and new tax incentives for health savings accounts; provide subsidies for state high-risk pools, to help people who could not otherwise obtain insurance; and make it easier for insurance companies to sell policies across state lines.They would also provide some protection for people with pre-existing conditions who have maintained continuous coverage. They could not be dropped by an insurer and could move from one plan to another, but a person with a pre-existing condition seeking insurance after a lapse of coverage could in some cases be charged higher rates. The protections would be weaker than those in the Affordable Care Act.Republicans also do not agree on how to pay for a replacement plan. In the House document, Republicans proposed limiting the value of tax-free health benefits that employers could provide to employees.Under the current law, employees do not have to pay federal income tax on contributions that employers make to their health insurance. House Republicans said this open-ended subsidy had encouraged people to select more expensive coverage, driving up premiums.But business groups, labor unions and some conservative lawmakers vehemently oppose that change, saying it amounts to a new tax on benefits and on working families. Senate Republicans have also not expressed support for the idea.Many House Republicans, including Mr. Price, would provide tax credits to help people buy insurance. But the amount of assistance would increase with age and would not be tied to income, as it is under the existing health care law.The subsidies would probably be smaller than under the Affordable Care Act. But insurance would be less expensive, Republicans say, because the government would impose fewer requirements.Mr. Alexander said he would allow individuals to use their Obamacare subsidies to purchase state-approved insurance outside the Obamacare exchanges. Under the health care law, such assistance can be used only in the insurance exchanges.Many Republicans say states should have much more power to define essential health benefits.On Medicaid, the federal insurance program for low-income people, House Republicans would roll back the Affordable Care Acts expansion and give each state a fixed amount of money for each beneficiary  or a lump sum of federal money for all of a states Medicaid program.But more than half the states, including some with Republican governors, have expanded Medicaid eligibility under Mr. Obamas law, with large sums of federal money, and pragmatic Republicans are reluctant to snatch away the federal money that has allowed big increases in Medicaid enrollment."
31,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/28/nyregion/neediest-cases-fund-iraqi-family.html,1/28/17,"Maha al-Obaidis family is divided.She immigrated to New York City in 2014, reuniting with her three sons who had arrived earlier. She expected that her husband, Husham al-Qadhi, and her two other sons would soon join her from Amman, Jordan, finally bringing the family together after a tumultuous decade of surviving the Iraq war, fleeing to Jordan and then searching for a permanent home.But on Friday, the family was dealt another blow, after President Trump approved a sweeping executive order on immigration that, among other things, blocked entry into the United States for 90 days for citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries including Iraq, where members of the family are citizens. Her husband and two sons in Jordan are for now locked out of the United States, and Ms. Obaidi cannot travel away, or risk being denied re-entry.Now our family in the U.S. cant even come to visit us, nor can we visit them, Mr. Qadhi said on Saturday in Amman. We just sit and watch like the rest of the world what is happening, and our fate is being decided for us, in front of our eyes.The family lived in Baghdad as American tanks, troops and missiles tore into the Iraqi capital in 2003. It stayed for several years, despite gunfire and bomb blasts outside its house and the kidnapping of several family members. The family helped American soldiers even though other Iraqis targeted it for doing so.One of the sons in Amman, Thabit al-Qadhi, said he and his father had run a snack bar on an American base in Baghdad, serving candy and soft drinks to troops, and operated a 24-hour internet cafe, which required them to be vetted and approved to begin work.After Thabit al-Qadhi was kidnapped in 2006 by Qaeda terrorists and eventually released, he said, he reported details about the episode to American officials in the hope that they would be caught. And on his way home from the Baghdad base one day, he came upon four American troops injured along the road, and he said he had loaded them into his car and driven them to the Green Zone.America has abandoned its responsibility to protect those who protected and cooperated with the Americans, he said. Its a decision solely based on my religious faith. Its discrimination solely on religious grounds.He added: This is the wrong decision. Is it even constitutional?The familys home was along one of Baghdads major highways, an entry point for American troops during the invasion. The family huddled in a windowless section of the home for 10 days, as bullets shattered windows and rockets blazed through the sky, until the United States took control of Baghdad.In the years after the invasion, the family remained in Iraq, even as unrest spread, militants took up arms and centuries-old tensions between Sunnis and Shiites flared up.In addition to Thabit al-Qadhi, Ms. Obaidis husband was also kidnapped, on two separate occasions. The family members recalled the lengths to which they went to get them freed, how they stuffed $60,000 in Iraqi dinars into garbage bags and were instructed by cellphone to travel to a series of locations before dropping off the ransom.It was like in the movies, Ms. Obaidi said in an interview this month.Fearing more attacks, the family left Iraq for Jordan. It joined many other Iraqi refugees, including extended family members. Ms. Obaidi and her husband used their savings to buy a home in Amman. Employment opportunities were scarce for Iraqis, leading three of her sons, starting in 2010, to venture to the United States to find work.When Ms. Obaidi later followed them, she hoped that her entire family could apply for asylum and unite in America. She made the trip despite a number of concerns.At first, I felt afraid, she said. How can I live in this country? It is a foreign country. It is very far from my culture. How will I be compatible with the community?To her surprise, Ms. Obaidi found New York to be unlike its gruff stereotypes. People smiled as she walked down the street. Men helped her haul heavy bags up stairs. Others offered her seats on the subway.Everybody in America is very nice, she said. They are very polite, helpful people, nice people, always with a smile on their face. That is my experience.She has found additional support from the International Rescue Committee, a global humanitarian aid, relief and development nongovernmental organization based in New York. Founded in 1933, the organization is the newest organization supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, and the only one of the eight groups whose work extends beyond the New York area. It operates in 29 cities in the United States and in more than 40 countries.The organization was instrumental in helping Ms. Obaidi adjust to her new life and connecting her with a number of social services, including health insurance and food stamps. It helped her obtain a Social Security card, navigate New Yorks streets and understand its transportation system. The group also helped her study for her drivers license permit exam, among other services.I feel I am not lonely, she said. I have somebody. I have somebody to support me.She shares a home in the Astoria neighborhood in Queens with two of her sons, Saif al-Qadhi and Qaed al-Qadhi. Her third son, Tameem al-Kadhi, and his wife, Melissa Forstrom, also live in the neighborhood.I have a nice life, Ms. Obaidi said. Even though my apartment is small, I feel happy in it. I like it.But it is a home with some notable, painful absences. Ive divided myself, Ms. Obaidi said. Some part is there in Jordan, and some parts _ She trailed off, overcome with emotion.In Amman, Thabit al-Qadhi, her oldest son, lives with his wife and 5-year-old son across the street from Ms. Obaidis husband, Husham, and their youngest son, Omar al-Qadhi. They have been denied asylum in the United States.In October 2015, Husham al-Qadhi was sent a conditional acceptance letter for asylum in the United States. About a year later, he received a second letter, denying him resettlement. Omar al-Qadhi, who works at Unicef to help provide water, sanitation and hygiene to Syrian refugees in Jordan, was also denied resettlement.We have lived here as if we were waiting for something, as if everything was temporary, but now we no longer know what we are waiting for, Omar al-Qadhi said in his apartment in Amman.Thabit al-Qadhi, who has traveled to New York several times to visit his family, has not received the same denial letters for resettlement in the United States. His tourist visa was renewed, but a week later, an officer at the American Embassy in Amman told him that his visa had been canceled, and his case for resettlement was denied.Whether they will ever get approval to move to the United States is even more uncertain now. Thabit al-Qadhi said that Mr. Trumps order was particularly painful and that he felt America was turning its back on Iraqis who had risked their lives to help soldiers during the war.At the end we realized we were no longer welcome, neither from the Iraqis because we worked with the Americans, nor from the Americans because we were Iraqi, he said.Like many Iraqis, Thabit al-Qadhi is living in Jordan on a conditional basis. He must renew his permission every year, and it is dependent on the familys financial means.Nothing is guaranteed in business, he said. Today, my trade company here is successful, but if one day the business fails, then what will happen? Where do I go?In the United States, his siblings, even with employment and legal immigration status, live in a similar state of unsteadiness and concern.For three years, Tameem al-Kadhis only proof of his legal status was an arrival-departure record known as an I-94 form, a document without a photo of him and only his name and identification numbers. It has hindered his attempts to travel even within the United States. Visas for Saif al-Qadhis wife and children were approved recently after a wait of more than two years. They were booked on a plane expected to arrive Feb. 7, but Fridays executive order by Mr. Trump has dashed those plans.The kids, they grow up far from their father, Saif al-Qadhi said. All of a sudden, I told them Im sorry, something changed. I may not be able to see you soon.He and his wife are distraught by the development, which leaves them in a precarious position. In anticipation of the move, their children were taken out of their private school and the lease on their apartment in Amman is to expire on Feb. 1.Im watching the news every second, Mr. Qadhi said.Ms. Obaidis children have been able to acclimate to their new surroundings and establish a rhythm in their lives. Tameem al-Kadhi owns a cellphone store in the East Village in Manhattan, Qaed al-Qadhi works as an information technology manager, and Saif al-Qadhi is an Uber driver. Ms. Obaidi stays busy by volunteering at the Masjid Dar Al-Dawah mosque.The family gathers as often as work schedules and other responsibilities allow, most often on Sundays, when Ms. Obaidi prepares a large meal. They all await the day when more chairs can be placed around the table.Halfway across the world, the other half of the family shares that sentiment. Omar al-Qadhi said he missed his brothers, but especially his mother. It just feels weird that we are now split, and the future looks grim, he said. We are travelers on a journey with no destination, and my family is so far away."
32,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/28/us/politics/congress-republicans-democrats.html,2/28/17,"WASHINGTON  Congressional Republicans, racked by divisions over health care, taxes and spending, are increasingly desperate for leadership from the White House to unite the party and point the way toward consensus.But presidential leadership does not appear to be forthcoming, leaving the party largely paralyzed at a moment it had thought would be full of legislative activity.The White House is huge, said Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota. The president is the only person who can sign a bill into law, so hes the guy that ultimately holds the whip hand when it comes to this getting done.As congressional leaders struggle to clear the first major legislative hurdle of the Trump era  a bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act  their talks with the White House, though not infrequent, have failed to advance any coherent, cohesive policy prescription. Repealing the health care law is the Republicans first step toward enacting their broader agenda.So far, President Trump, seeking to project an image of a man of action, has preferred attention-grabbing executive actions over closed-door engagement with Congress.In the absence of presidential leadership, the most fiscally conservative House Republicans have stepped forward to demand that the health care law be whittled to near nothingness. More moderate senators are insisting on a replacement plan with many of the current laws popular components.Both sides are pressing hard to sway lawmakers working on draft legislation that would roll back the Affordable Care Acts expansion of Medicaid, replace the subsidies offered in the insurance marketplaces with tax credits to buy coverage, and eliminate tax penalties for people who do not have health insurance.After weeks of loud protests across the country from voters who are fearful of losing their health care, Republican governors complicated matters further this week by joining Democrats in a call for a replacement plan that would ensure coverage for the 20 million Americans who gained insurance under the Affordable Care Act.Id like to hear a renewed commitment to repealing the law, said Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah  another sign of just how far the party is from unity.Democrats, who have been dismissed as obstructionists by Republicans determined to repeal and replace the law without them, are sitting by quietly waiting for those efforts to fail. At that point, Democrats believe, Republicans will have to reach across the aisle and repair the law.Weve maintained all along there is room to negotiate, said Senator Brian Schatz, Democrat of Hawaii. But only if they abandon their attempt to repeal the law.While he has seen no moves toward cooperation yet, they are in a world of hurt, Mr. Schatz said of Republicans, because none of their plans add up, and their members are starting to figure this out and the public is starting to figure this out, and they dont have Obama as a foil anymore. I think they need to fail first.Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri, who has long offered to help fix the law, said she had heard from only one Republican colleague, Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, since the end of last year. I dont think Republicans have decided what theyre waiting for, she said. The White House or Godot.Many Republicans seem to be resigned to seeking consensus on health care legislation, as well as on a budget and tax reform, without comprehensive White House guidance.Representative Michael McCaul, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said he was relying less on a signal from Mr. Trump than on behind-the-scenes discussions between lawmakers and the administration to get the details filled in.Those details include how Mr. Trump plans to fund his call for a 10 percent increase in military spending, Mr. McCaul said. From a budget standpoint, these numbers are difficult to crunch, he said. We as Republicans want a stronger national defense. That moneys got to come from someplace. Thats where the hard decisions have to be made.Mr. Trumps aversion to making big changes to two of the costliest government programs, Medicare and Social Security  something Republicans generally crave  is not helping matters. That makes it even more difficult, Mr. McCaul said.The presidents budget outline, unveiled this week, has something for almost every Republican to hate, from the lack of so-called entitlement reform to large proposed cuts at the State Department.Speaking for myself, said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, I think the diplomatic portion of the federal budget is very important, and you get results a lot cheaper, frequently, than you do on the defense side. So, speaking for myself, Im not in favor of huge reductions at the State Department.Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, called those cuts dead in the water for him.Many of Mr. Trumps direct contributions to the legislative process have happened through the news media, as he has signaled his priorities in interviews that have sometimes left congressional Republicans scrambling to decipher his intentions.Representative Eric Swalwell, Democrat of California, said some of his Republican colleagues were frustrated by their inability to move forward. Theyre reading about what he wants to do at the same time I am in the paper, he said.Six weeks after Mr. Trump said Republicans would provide a replacement plan for the Affordable Care Act that offered insurance for everybody, Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin is fighting to reconcile his partys competing priorities while also contending with the occasional messaging complication from the White House.This is a plan that we are all working on together: the House, the Senate, the White House, Mr. Ryan said Tuesday. Were all working on this together with the administration."
33,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/28/us/politics/trump-congress-video-transcript.html,2/28/17,"President Trump on Tuesday delivered his first address to a joint session of Congress. The following is a transcript, as prepared by the Federal News Service. For more coverage, read our live analysis.TRUMP: Thank you very much. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of Congress, the first lady of the United States ...(APPLAUSE)... and citizens of America, tonight, as we mark the conclusion of our celebration of Black History Month, we are reminded of our nations path toward civil rights and the work that still remains to be done.Recent threats ...(APPLAUSE)Recent threats targeting Jewish community centers and vandalism of Jewish cemeteries, as well as last weeks shooting in Kansas City, remind us that while we may be a nation divided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all of its very ugly forms.(APPLAUSE)Each American generation passes the torch of truth, liberty and justice, in an unbroken chain all the way down to the present. That torch is now in our hands. And we will use it to light up the world.I am here tonight to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is a message deeply delivered from my heart. A new chapter ...(APPLAUSE)... of American greatness is now beginning. A new national pride is sweeping across our nation. And a new surge of optimism is placing impossible dreams firmly within our grasp. What we are witnessing today is the renewal of the American spirit. Our allies will find that America is once again ready to lead.(APPLAUSE)All the nations of the world  friend or foe  will find that America is strong, America is proud, and America is free. In nine years, the United States will celebrate the 250th anniversary of our founding, 250 years since the day we declared our independence. It will be one of the great milestones in the history of the world.But what will America look like as we reach our 250th year? What kind of country will we leave for our children? I will not allow the mistakes of recent decades past to define the course of our future.For too long, weve watched our middle class shrink as weve exported our jobs and wealth to foreign countries. Weve financed and built one global project after another, but ignored the fates of our children in the inner cities of Chicago, Baltimore, Detroit and so many other places throughout our land.Weve defended the borders of other nations while leaving our own borders wide open for anyone to cross [Fact check: Open in parts, but heavily patrolled as well.], and for drugs to pour in at a now unprecedented rate. And weve spent trillions and trillions of dollars overseas, while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled.Then, in 2016, the earth shifted beneath our feet. The rebellion started as a quiet protest, spoken by families of all colors and creeds, families who just wanted a fair shot for their children, and a fair hearing for their concerns.But then the quiet voices became a loud chorus, as thousands of citizens now spoke out together, from cities small and large, all across our country.Finally, the chorus became an earthquake, and the people turned out by the tens of millions, and they were all united by one very simple, but crucial demand, that America must put its own citizens first, because only then can we truly make America great again.(APPLAUSE)Dying industries will come roaring back to life. Heroic veterans will get the care they so desperately need. Our military will be given the resources its brave warriors so richly deserve.Crumbling infrastructure will be replaced with new roads, bridges, tunnels, airports and railways, gleaming across our very, very beautiful land. Our terrible drug epidemic will slow down and ultimately stop. And our neglected inner cities will see a rebirth of hope, safety and opportunity.Above all else, we will keep our promises to the American people.(APPLAUSE)Thank you. Its been a little over a month since my inauguration, and I want to take this moment to update the nation on the progress Ive made in keeping those promises. Since my election, Ford, Fiat-Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Softbank, Lockheed, Intel, Walmart and many others have announced that they will invest billions and billions of dollars in the United States and will create tens of thousands of new American jobs.(APPLAUSE)The stock market has gained almost $3 trillion in value since the election on Nov. 8, a record. Weve saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars by bringing down the price of fantastic  and it is a fantastic  new F-35 jet fighter, and well be saving billions more on contracts all across our government.We have placed a hiring freeze on nonmilitary and nonessential federal workers.We have begun to drain the swamp of government corruption by imposing a five-year ban on lobbying by executive branch officials  and a lifetime ban ...(APPLAUSE)Thank you. Thank you. And a lifetime ban on becoming lobbyists for a foreign government. We have undertaken a historic effort to massively reduce job-crushing regulations, creating a deregulation task force inside of every government agency ...(APPLAUSE)... and were imposing a new rule which mandates that for every one new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated.(APPLAUSE)Were going to stop the regulations that threaten the future and livelihood of our great coal miners. [Fact check: This is partly true but misleading.](APPLAUSE)We have cleared the way for the construction of the Keystone and Dakota Access Pipelines ...(APPLAUSE)... thereby creating tens of thousands of jobs. [Fact check: This needs context.] And Ive issued a new directive that new American pipelines be made with American steel.(APPLAUSE)We have withdrawn the United States from the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership.(APPLAUSE)And with the help of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, we have formed a council with our neighbors in Canada to help ensure that women entrepreneurs have access to the networks, markets and capital they need to start a business and live out their financial dreams.(APPLAUSE)To protect our citizens, I have directed the Department of Justice to form a task force on reducing violent crime. I have further ordered the Departments of Homeland Security and Justice, along with the Department of State and the director of national intelligence, to coordinate an aggressive strategy to dismantle the criminal cartels that have spread all across our nation. [Fact check: True, but they dont do much.](APPLAUSE)We will stop the drugs from pouring into our country and poisoning our youth, and we will expand treatment for those who have become so badly addicted.(APPLAUSE)At the same time, my administration has answered the pleas of the American people for immigration enforcement and border security.(APPLAUSE)By finally enforcing our immigration laws, we will raise wages [Fact check: Maybe a little.], help the unemployed, save billions and billions of dollars, and make our communities safer for everyone.(APPLAUSE)We want all Americans to succeed, but that cant happen in an environment of lawless chaos.We must restore integrity and the rule of law at our borders.(APPLAUSE)For that reason, we will soon begin the construction of a great, great wall along our southern border.(APPLAUSE)As we speak tonight, we are removing gang members, drug dealers and criminals that threaten our communities and prey on our very innocent citizens. [Fact check: Not a big change.] Bad ones are going out as I speak, and as I promised throughout the campaign. To any in Congress who do not believe we should enforce our laws, I would ask you this one question: What would you say to the American family that loses their jobs, their income or their loved one because America refused to uphold its laws and defend its borders?(APPLAUSE)Our obligation is to serve, protect and defend the citizens of the United States. We are also taking strong measures to protect our nation from radical Islamic terrorism.(APPLAUSE)According to data provided by the Department of Justice, the vast majority of individuals convicted of terrorism and terrorism-related offenses since 9/11 came here from outside of our country. We have seen the attacks at home, from Boston to San Bernardino to the Pentagon and, yes, even the World Trade Center. We have seen the attacks in France, in Belgium, in Germany and all over the world.It is not compassionate, but reckless to allow uncontrolled entry from places where proper vetting cannot occur.(APPLAUSE)Those given the high honor of admission to the United States should support this country and love its people and its values. We cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form inside America, and we cannot allow our nation to become a sanctuary for extremists.(APPLAUSE) That is why my administration has been working on improved vetting procedures, and we will shortly take new steps to keep our nation safe, and to keep those out who will do us harm.(APPLAUSE)As promised, I directed the Department of Defense to develop a plan to demolish and destroy ISIS, a network of lawless savages that have slaughtered Muslims and Christians, and men, women and children of all faiths and all beliefs. We will work with our allies, including our friends and allies in the Muslim world, to extinguish this vile enemy from our planet.(APPLAUSE)I have also imposed new sanctions on entities and individuals who support Irans ballistic missile program, and reaffirmed our unbreakable alliance with the state of Israel.(APPLAUSE)Finally, I have kept my promise to appoint a justice to the United States Supreme Court, from my list of 20 judges, who will defend our Constitution.(APPLAUSE)I am greatly honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the gallery tonight.(APPLAUSE)Thank you, Maureen. Her late, great husband, Antonin Scalia, will forever be a symbol of American justice.To fill his seat, we have chosen Judge Neil Gorsuch, a man of incredible skill and deep devotion to the law. He was confirmed unanimously by the Court of Appeals, and I am asking the Senate to swiftly approve his nomination.(APPLAUSE)Tonight, as I outline the next steps we must take as a country, we must honestly acknowledge the circumstances we inherited. Ninety-four million Americans are out of the labor force. [Fact check: This is misleading.] Over 43 million people are now living in poverty. [Fact check: True  but the number has also fallen.] And over 43 million Americans are on food stamps. [Fact check: The number is correct.]More than one in five people in their prime working years are not working. We have the worst financial recovery in 65 years. In the last eight years, the past administration has put on more new debt than nearly all of the other presidents combined.Weve lost more than one-fourth of our manufacturing jobs since Nafta was approved [Fact check: Not because of Nafta.], and weve lost 60,000 factories since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001. Our trade deficit in goods with the world last year was nearly $800 billion. And overseas, we have inherited a series of tragic foreign policy disasters.Solving these and so many other pressing problems will require us to work past the differences of party. It will require us to tap into the American spirit that has overcome every challenge throughout our long and storied history. But to accomplish our goals at home and abroad, we must restart the engine of the American economy, making it easier for companies to do business in the United States and much, much harder for companies to leave our country.(APPLAUSE)Right now, American companies are taxed at one of the highest rates anywhere in the world. My economic team is developing historic tax reform that will reduce the tax rate on our companies so they can compete and thrive anywhere and with anyone.(APPLAUSE)It will be a big, big cut.At the same time, we will provide massive tax relief for the middle class. We must create a level playing field for American companies and our workers  have to do it.(APPLAUSE)Currently, when we ship products out of America, many other countries make us pay very high tariffs and taxes, but when foreign companies ship their products into America, we charge them nothing or almost nothing.I just met with officials and workers from a great American company, Harley-Davidson. In fact, they proudly displayed five of their magnificent motorcycles, made in the U.S.A., on the front lawn of the White House.(APPLAUSE)And they wanted me to ride one, and I said, No, thank you.(LAUGHTER)At our meeting, I asked them, How are you doing? How is business? They said that its good. I asked them further, How are you doing with other countries, mainly international sales?They told me  without even complaining, because they have been so mistreated for so long that theyve become used to it  that its very hard to do business with other countries, because they tax our goods at such a high rate. They said that in the case of another country, they taxed their motorcycles at 100 percent.They werent even asking for a change. But I am. I believe ...(APPLAUSE)I believe strongly in free trade, but it also has to be fair trade. Its been a long time since we had fair trade.The first Republican president, Abraham Lincoln, warned that the abandonment of the protective policy by the American government will produce want and ruin among our people.Lincoln was right, and its time we heeded his advice and his words.(APPLAUSE)I am not going to let America and its great companies and workers be taken  advantage of us any longer. They have taken advantage of our country no longer.(APPLAUSE)I am going to bring back millions of jobs. Protecting our workers also means reforming our system of legal immigration.(APPLAUSE)The current, outdated system depresses wages for our poorest workers and puts great pressure on taxpayers. Nations around the world, like Canada, Australia and many others, have a merit-based immigration system.(APPLAUSE)Its a basic principle that those seeking to enter a country ought to be able to support themselves financially. Yet in America we do not enforce this rule, straining the very public resources that our poorest citizens rely upon.According to the National Academy of Sciences, our current immigration system costs American taxpayers many billions of dollars a year. [Fact check: This needs context.] Switching away from this current system of lower-skilled immigration, and instead adopting a merit-based system, we will have so many more benefits. It will save countless dollars, raise workers wages and help struggling families, including immigrant families, enter the middle class. And they will do it quickly, and they will be very, very happy, indeed.(APPLAUSE)I believe that real and positive immigration reform is possible, as long as we focus on the following goals: to improve jobs and wages for Americans, to strengthen our nations security and to restore respect for our laws.If we are guided by the well-being of American citizens, then I believe Republicans and Democrats can work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades.(APPLAUSE)Another Republican president, Dwight D. Eisenhower, initiated the last truly great national infrastructure program: the building of the interstate highway system. The time has come for a new program of national rebuilding.(APPLAUSE)America has spent approximately $6 trillion in the Middle East, all the while our infrastructure at home is crumbling.With the $6 trillion, we could have rebuilt our country twice, and maybe even three times, if we had people who had the ability to negotiate.(APPLAUSE)To launch our national rebuilding, I will be asking Congress to approve legislation that produces a $1 trillion investment in infrastructure of the United States, financed through both public and private capital, creating millions of new jobs.(APPLAUSE)This effort will be guided by two core principles: Buy American and hire American.(APPLAUSE)Tonight, I am also calling on this Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare ...(APPLAUSE)... with reforms that expand choice, increase access, lower costs and at the same time provide better health care.(APPLAUSE)Mandating every American to buy government-approved health insurance was never the right solution for our country.(APPLAUSE)The way to make health insurance available to everyone is to lower the cost of health insurance, and that is what we are going to do.(APPLAUSE)Obamacare premiums nationwide have increased by double and triple digits. [Fact check: True, but cherry-picked.] As an example, Arizona went up 116 percent last year alone. Gov. Matt Bevin of Kentucky just said Obamacare is failing in his state, the state of Kentucky, and its unsustainable and collapsing.One third of the counties have only one insurer, and theyre losing them fast, they are losing them so fast. Theyre leaving. And many Americans have no choice at all. Theres no choice left.Remember when you were told that you could keep your doctor and keep your plan? We now know that all of those promises have been totally broken. Obamacare is collapsing [Fact check: This is an exaggeration.], and we must act decisively to protect all Americans.(APPLAUSE)Action is not a choice; it is a necessity. So I am calling on all Democrats and Republicans in Congress to work with us to save Americans from this imploding Obamacare disaster.(APPLAUSE)Here are the principles that should guide Congress as we move to create a better health care system for all Americans.First, we should ensure that Americans with pre-existing conditions have access to coverage and that we have a stable transition for Americans currently enrolled in the health care exchanges.(APPLAUSE)Secondly, we should help Americans purchase their own coverage, through the use of tax credits and expanded health savings accounts, but it must be the plan they want, not the plan forced on them by our government.(APPLAUSE)Thirdly, we should give our state governors the resources and flexibility they need with Medicaid to make sure no one is left out.(APPLAUSE)Fourth, we should implement legal reforms that protect patients and doctors from unnecessary costs that drive up the price of insurance and work to bring down the artificially high price of drugs and bring them down immediately.(APPLAUSE)And finally, the time has come to give Americans the freedom to purchase health insurance across state lines ...(APPLAUSE)... which will create a truly competitive national marketplace that will bring costs way down and provide far better care. So important.Everything that is broken in our country can be fixed. Every problem can be solved. And every hurting family can find healing and hope. Our citizens deserve this, and so much more, so why not join forces and finally get the job done and get it done right?(APPLAUSE)On this and so many other things, Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite for the good of our country and for the good of the American people.(APPLAUSE)My administration wants to work with members of both parties to make child care accessible and affordable, to help ensure new parents that they have paid family leave ...(APPLAUSE)... to invest in womens health, and to promote clean air and clean water, and to rebuild our military and our infrastructure.(APPLAUSE)True love for our people requires us to find common ground, to advance the common good, and to cooperate on behalf of every American child who deserves a much brighter future.An incredible young woman is with us this evening who should serve as an inspiration to us all. Today is Rare Disease Day, and joining us in the gallery is a rare disease survivor, Megan Crowley. Megan ...(APPLAUSE)Megan was diagnosed with Pompe disease, a rare and serious illness, when she was 15 months old. She was not expected to live past 5. On receiving this news, Megans dad, John, fought with everything he had to save the life of his precious child. He founded a company to look for a cure and helped develop the drug that saved Megans life. Today she is 20 years old and a sophomore at Notre Dame.(APPLAUSE)Megans story is about the unbounded power of a fathers love for a daughter. But our slow and burdensome approval process at the Food and Drug Administration keeps too many advances, like the one that saved Megans life, from reaching those in need.If we slash the restraints, not just at the F.D.A. but across our government, then we will be blessed with far more miracles just like Megan.(APPLAUSE)In fact, our children will grow up in a nation of miracles. But to achieve this future, we must enrich the mind  and the souls  of every American child. Education is the civil rights issue of our time.(APPLAUSE)I am calling upon members of both parties to pass an education bill that funds school choice for disadvantaged youth, including millions of African-American and Latino children.(APPLAUSE)These families should be free to choose the public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home school that is right for them.(APPLAUSE)Joining us tonight in the gallery is a remarkable woman, Denisha Merriweather. As a young girl, Denisha struggled in school and failed third grade twice. But then she was able to enroll in a private center for learning  great learning center  with the help of a tax credit and a scholarship program. Today, she is the first in her family to graduate, not just from high school, but from college. Later this year, she will get her masters degree in social work. We want all children to be able to break the cycle of poverty just like Denisha.(APPLAUSE)But to break the cycle of poverty, we must also break the cycle of violence. The murder rate in 2015 experienced its largest single-year increase in nearly half a century. [Fact check: True, but somewhat misleading.] In Chicago, more than 4,000 people were shot last year alone, and the murder rate so far this year has been even higher. This is not acceptable in our society.(APPLAUSE)Every American child should be able to grow up in a safe community, to attend a great school and to have access to a high-paying job.(APPLAUSE)But to create this future, we must work with  not against  not against  the men and women of law enforcement.(APPLAUSE)We must build bridges of cooperation and trust, not drive the wedge of disunity and its  really, its what it is, division. Its pure, unadulterated division. We have to unify. Police and sheriffs are members of our community. Theyre friends and neighbors, theyre mothers and fathers, sons and daughters, and they leave behind loved ones every day who worry about whether or not theyll come home safe and sound. We must support the incredible men and women of law enforcement.(APPLAUSE)And we must support the victims of crime. I have ordered the Department of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American victims. The office is called Voice, Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement.We are providing a voice to those who have been ignored by our media [Fact check: They have received coverage.] and silenced by special interests. Joining us ...(APPLAUSE)Joining us in the audience tonight are four very brave Americans whose government failed them. Their names are Jamiel Shaw, Susan Oliver, Jenna Oliver and Jessica Davis. Jamiels 17-year-old son was viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member who had just been released from prison. Jamiel Shaw Jr. was an incredible young man with unlimited potential who was getting ready to go to college, where he would have excelled as a great college quarterback.But he never got the chance. His father, who is in the audience tonight, has become a very good friend of mine. Jamiel, thank you. Thank you.(APPLAUSE)Also with us are Susan Oliver and Jessica Davis. Their husbands  Deputy Sheriff Danny Oliver and Detective Michael Davis  were slain in the line of duty in California. They were pillars of their community. These brave men were viciously gunned down by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record and two prior deportations. Should have never been in our country.Sitting with Susan is her daughter, Jenna. Jenna, I want you to know that your father was a hero and that tonight you have the love of an entire country supporting you and praying for you.(APPLAUSE)To Jamiel, Jenna, Susan and Jessica, I want you to know that we will never stop fighting for justice. Your loved ones will never, ever be forgotten. We will always honor their memory.(APPLAUSE)Finally, to keep America safe, we must provide the men and women of the United States military with the tools they need to prevent war  if they must  they have to fight and they only have to win.(APPLAUSE)I am sending Congress a budget that rebuilds the military, eliminates the defense sequester...(APPLAUSE)... and calls for one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history.My budget will also increase funding for our veterans. Our veterans have delivered for this nation, and now we must deliver for them.(APPLAUSE)The challenges we face as a nation are great. But our people are even greater. And none are greater or braver than those who fight for America in uniform.(APPLAUSE)We are blessed to be joined tonight by Carryn Owens, the widow of U.S. Navy special operator, Senior Chief William Ryan Owens. Ryan died as he lived, a warrior and a hero, battling against terrorism and securing our nation.(APPLAUSE)I just spoke to our great General [Jim] Mattis just now who reconfirmed that, and I quote, Ryan was a part of a highly successful raid that generated large amounts of vital intelligence that will lead to many more victories in the future against our enemy.Ryans legacy is etched into eternity. Thank you.(APPLAUSE)And Ryan is looking down right now. You know that. And hes very happy, because I think he just broke a record.(APPLAUSE)For as the Bible teaches us, there is no greater act of love than to lay down ones life for ones friends. Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his country and for our freedom. And we will never forget Ryan.(APPLAUSE)To those allies who wonder what kind of a friend America will be, look no further than the heroes who wear our uniform. Our foreign policy calls for a direct, robust and meaningful engagement with the world. It is American leadership based on vital security interests that we share with our allies all across the globe.We strongly support NATO, an alliance forged through the bonds of two world wars, that dethroned fascism ...(APPLAUSE)... and a Cold War and defeated communism.(APPLAUSE)But our partners must meet their financial obligations. And now, based on our very strong and frank discussions, they are beginning to do just that. In fact, I can tell you the money is pouring in. Very nice.(APPLAUSE)We expect our partners, whether in NATO, in the Middle East or in the Pacific, to take a direct and meaningful role in both strategic and military operations, and pay their fair share of the cost  have to do that.We will respect historic institutions, but we will respect the foreign rights of all nations. And they have to respect our rights as a nation, also.(APPLAUSE)Free nations are the best vehicle for expressing the will of the people, and America respects the right of all nations to chart their own path. My job is not to represent the world. My job is to represent the United States of America.(APPLAUSE)But we know that America is better off when there is less conflict, not more. We must learn from the mistakes of the past. We have seen the war and the destruction that have ravaged and raged throughout the world. All across the world.The only long-term solution for these humanitarian disasters, in many cases, is to create the conditions where displaced persons can safely return home and begin the long, long process of rebuilding.(APPLAUSE)America is willing to find new friends, and to forge new partnerships, where shared interests align. We want harmony and stability, not war and conflict. We want peace, wherever peace can be found. America is friends today with former enemies. Some of our closest allies, decades ago, fought on the opposite side of these terrible, terrible wars. This history should give us all faith in the possibilities for a better world.Hopefully, the 250th year for America will see a world that is more peaceful, more just, and more free.On our 100th anniversary in 1876, citizens from across our nation came to Philadelphia to celebrate Americas centennial. At that celebration, the countrys builders and artists and inventors showed off their wonderful creations. Alexander Graham Bell displayed his telephone for the first time. Remington unveiled the first typewriter. An early attempt was made at electric light. Thomas Edison showed an automatic telegraph and an electric pen. Imagine the wonders our country could know in Americas 250th year.(APPLAUSE)Think of the marvels we could achieve if we simply set free the dreams of our people. Cures to the illnesses that have always plagued us are not too much to hope. American footprints on distant worlds are not too big a dream. Millions lifted from welfare to work is not too much to expect. And streets where mothers are safe from fear  schools where children learn in peace, and jobs where Americans prosper and grow  are not too much to ask.(APPLAUSE)When we have all of this, we will have made America greater than ever before, for all Americans. This is our vision. This is our mission. But we can only get there together. We are one people, with one destiny.We all bleed the same blood. We all salute the same great American flag. And we are all made by the same God.(APPLAUSE)When we fulfill this vision, when we celebrate our 250 years of glorious freedom, we will look back on tonight as when this new chapter of American greatness began. The time for small thinking is over. The time for trivial fights is behind us. We just need the courage to share the dreams that fill our hearts, the bravery to express the hopes that stir our souls, and the confidence to turn those hopes and those dreams into action.From now on, America will be empowered by our aspirations, not burdened by our fears, inspired by the future, not bound by failures of the past, and guided by a vision, not blinded by our doubts.I am asking all citizens to embrace this renewal of the American spirit. I am asking all members of Congress to join me in dreaming big and bold and daring things for our country. I am asking everyone watching tonight to seize this moment. Believe in yourselves. Believe in your future. And believe, once more, in America.Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States."
34,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/13/us/politics/seema-verma-medicaid-medicare-administrator.html,3/13/17,"WASHINGTON  The Senate on Monday confirmed Seema Verma, a health policy expert from Indiana, to lead efforts by the Trump administration to transform Medicaid and upend the Affordable Care Act.By a vote of 55 to 43, the Senate approved the nomination of Ms. Verma to be the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which spends more than $1 trillion a year on programs providing health care to more than one-third of all Americans.Unlike most people who have held the job, Ms. Verma has extensive experience in Medicaid, a program that was expanded by President Barack Obamas health care law and now provides coverage to more than 70 million low-income people.Ms. Verma was an architect of Indianas Medicaid program, widely seen as a model by conservatives, and she worked closely with Vice President Mike Pence when he was the states governor. Indiana expanded Medicaid eligibility, but emphasized personal responsibility. That means that beneficiaries pay premiums, contribute to health savings accounts and receive incentives for healthy behavior.Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah and chairman of the Finance Committee, said Ms. Verma was the ideal candidate to oversee the reform of the Medicaid program, as she had worked well with members of both parties in Indiana and in other states.But Senator Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, said she has supported proposals that create roadblocks to coverage for low-income Americans. And she would have a major role in carrying out legislation to gut the Affordable Care Act and remake the Medicaid program, said Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the senior Democrat on the Finance Committee.A plan by House Republicans, which was released last week, would repeal major parts of Mr. Obamas health care law and would phase out the expansion of Medicaid that has brought coverage to millions of people.Senate Democrats cast a wary eye on how Ms. Verma might enforce the legislation, if it is approved. Mr. Wyden said she would be able to give states a green light to push the very frail and sick into high-risk pools in which they could receive substandard coverage or be forced to pay more for the care they need. Senator Maria Cantwell, Democrat of Washington, said Ms. Verma in Indiana made millions of dollars in consulting fees by kicking poor, working people off of Medicaid for failure to pay monthly contributions similar to premiums.And Senator Debbie Stabenow, Democrat of Michigan, said she was dismayed that Ms. Verma had suggested at her confirmation hearing last month that coverage of maternity care should be optional, not required, as it is now under the Affordable Care Act.At that hearing, Ms. Verma said: Some women might want maternity coverage and some women might not want it, might not choose it, might not feel like they need that. So I think its up to women to make the decision that works best for them and their families.But not all Democrats found fault with Ms. Vermas work on Medicaid in Indiana. Under the program she helped devise, hundreds of thousands of Hoosiers currently have health insurance, said Senator Joe Donnelly of Indiana, one of three Democrats who voted for her on Monday.This plan, he said, has helped lower our states uninsured rate and improve health care outcomes, and has played a critical role in combating the opioid-abuse and heroin-use epidemics.The Obama administration granted a waiver for Indianas Medicaid program following lengthy negotiations, and several other states are considering similar changes. Tom Price, the secretary of health and human services, promised last week to give states greater flexibility.Judith Solomon, a vice president at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal-leaning research and advocacy group, said the premiums charged to Medicaid beneficiaries in Indiana, as well as the complexity of the program, appeared to be deterring significant numbers of eligible low-income people from enrolling. Still, she said, the coverage provided under Indianas plan is better than no coverage at all.And without the conservative features of the program, state officials said, Indiana might not have expanded eligibility.Dennis M. Murphy, the chief executive of Indiana University Health, and top executives of five other hospital systems in Indiana endorsed Ms. Verma, saying in a joint statement that she had shown a knack for bipartisan solutions that unite people across the political spectrum.The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has led federal efforts to carry out the Affordable Care Act, setting standards for private health insurance and operating HealthCare.gov, the online marketplace on which more than 10 million people obtained coverage last year.Ms. Verma has comparatively little experience with Medicare, the popular program that insures 57 million people who are 65 or older or have disabilities. Within a decade, enrollment is expected to grow by one-third, to 76 million. As a presidential candidate, Mr. Trump said he did not intend to cut Medicare or Medicaid."
