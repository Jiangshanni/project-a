The genetic counselors working in the WSGSC developed, tested, and implemented a web resource (http://www.westernstatesgenetics.org/ACA_home.htm) to help families navigate information about the ACA tailored to their life situation. The training and experience of genetic counselors provide the skills needed to translate complicated information, like that of the ACA, into formats that the general public can comprehend. The website went public in October 2013, and it has been positively received. The development of this website is a good case study in how genetic counseling skills can be applied to public health education and improving health literacy. © 2014, National Society of Genetic Counselors, Inc."

Since the late 1990s, 29 states have mandated that insurance providers include prescription contraceptive supplies and, in some instances, associated contraceptive services in their coverage. We use state-level policy variation to generate both difference-in-differences and triple difference estimates to determine if women in states with state-level contraception supply or contraception supply and services insurance mandates experienced changes in their utilization of contraception and preventive health care services. We find a positive relationship between these policies and prescription contraception use for those with low educational attainment, but the results are not robust to a variety of specifications. Our results also show an increase in the consumption of preventive health services for women with low educational attainment as a result of these health insurance mandates. We conclude by discussing the implications for the ACA. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht."

These youth have been raised and educated in the United States and have aspirations and educational achievements similar to those of their native-born peers. However, their undocumented status has hindered their pursuit of higher education, especially in medical and other graduate health sciences. Under a new discretionary policy, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), many of these young immigrants are eligible to receive permission to reside and work in the United States. DACA defers deportation of eligible, undocumented youth and grants lawful presence in the United States, work permits, Social Security numbers, and, in most states, driver's licenses. These privileges have diminished the barriers undocumented students traditionally have faced in obtaining higher education, specifically in pursuing medicine. With the advent of DACA, students are slowly matriculating into U.S. medical schools and residencies. However, this applicant pool remains largely untapped. In the face of a physician shortage and the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, an increase in matriculation of qualified undocumented students would be greatly beneficial. This Perspective is intended to begin discussion within the academic medicine community of the implications of DACA in reducing barriers for the selection and matriculation of undocumented medical students and residents. Moreover, this Perspective is a call to peers in the medical community to support undocumented students seeking access to medical school, residency, and other health professions."

This brief examines how states have implemented these federal reforms in their individual health insurance markets. We identify state rating standards for the first year of full implementation of reform and explore critical considerations weighed by policymakers as they determined how to adopt the law's requirements. Most states took the opportunity to customize at least some aspect of their rating standards. Interviews with state regulators reveal that many states pursued implementation strategies intended primarily to minimize market disruption and premium shock and therefore established standards as consistent as possible with existing rules or market practice. Meanwhile, some states used the transition period to strengthen consumer protections, particularly with respect to tobacco rating."

Specialty medications that are crucial to effective disease management, helping to prevent debilitating episodes of relapse, account for a substantial portion of the medical expenditures associated with MS. Although these therapies are not considered cost-effective by conventional definitions, they are comparable to one another in cost-effectiveness estimates, leaving the complex task of designing cost-efficient formulary management strategies to managed care professionals. Current epidemiologic data suggest that most patients with MS are covered by some form of healthcare insurance, but plan designs and formulary restrictions may still create access barriers for some patients. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) is recent federal legislation that seeks to provide new consumer protections, improve healthcare quality and accessibility while mitigating expenditures, and increase accountability of healthcare insurance companies. The impact of the ACA on specialty pharmaceuticals is unclear at this time, but it does appear to have already begun improving healthcare coverage across the population. Managed care professionals must work within the confines of the ACA to provide better and more affordable care that targets overall cost reductions rather than just pharmacy expenses."

The cause of MS is currently unknown, but immediate family history, low blood levels of vitamin D, and cigarette smoking, among other factors, appear to increase the risk of developing MS. MS is considered an immune-mediated disease, whereby immune cells target and attack the CNS, predominantly the axonal membrane known as the myelin sheath. Depending on which areas of the brain or spinal cord are affected, this can result in a variety of waxing and waning neurologic symptoms. Most patients will eventually suffer from progressive disability that can greatly impact their quality of life. Symptoms such as fatigue, difficulty with ambulation, and depression are common among patients with MS and can affect their ability to work and care for themselves. Costs due to treatment and lost productivity place a significant economic burden on patients, caregivers, families, and society. Current and future treatments may help limit the personal and societal costs of MS by delaying disability and disease progression."

Furthermore, treatment individualization has become more feasible as new medications with distinct mechanisms of action and improved adverse event profiles have reached the market. As such, clinicians should familiarize themselves with the available treatment options, paying particular attention to their various advantages and disadvantages. In order to offer patients optimal MS therapy, it is crucial for clinicians to stay current with the changing landscape of multiple sclerosis. This article provides a review of the available pharmacotherapeutic options for treating MS, discusses the impact of adherence to therapy, and describes the importance of managing comorbidities often experienced by patients with MS."

Several initiatives by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services are moving toward basing hospital reimbursement on performance on quality measures. Instead of focusing on getting patients out as quickly as possible, case managers must look at what happens to patients after discharge. Hospitals are going to have to change from choosing the cheapest post-discharge setting to looking at which provider can do the best job for each individual patient, experts say."

The ACA, in part, amended the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act), among other things, to require restaurants and similar retail food establishments that are part of a chain with 20 or more locations doing business under the same name and offering for sale substantially the same menu items to provide calorie and other nutrition information for standard menu items, including food on display and self-service food. Under provisions of the ACA, restaurants and similar retail food establishments not otherwise covered by the law may elect to become subject to these Federal requirements by registering every other year with FDA. Providing accurate, clear, and consistent nutrition information, including the calorie content of foods, in restaurants and similar retail food establishments will make such nutrition information available to consumers in a direct and accessible manner to enable consumers to make informed and healthful dietary choices."

Employees' contributions to their premiums climbed by 93 percent over that time frame. At the same time, deductibles more than doubled in both large and small firms. Workers are thus paying more but getting less protective benefits. However, the study also finds that while premiums continued to rise through 2013, the rate of growth slowed between 2010 and 2013, following implementation of the Affordable Care Act. While families experienced slower growth in premium contributions and deductibles over this period, sluggish growth in median family income means families are paying more in premiums and deductibles as a share of their income than ever before."

It was intended to be a temporary program: PCIPs opened in 2010 and closed in April 2014. At that point, those with preexisting conditions could shop for health insurance in the marketplaces, where plans are prevented from using applicants' health status to deny coverage or charge more. This issue brief draws on the PCIP experience to outline why national high-risk pools, which continue to be proposed as policy alternatives to ACA coverage expansions, are expensive to enrollees as well as their administrators and ultimately unsustainable. The key lesson--and the principle on which the ACA is built--is that insurance works best when risk is evenly spread across a broad population."

They are doing so under Section 1115 of the Social Security Act, which authorizes Medicaid demonstrations that further program objectives. State demonstrations approved so far combine expanded adult coverage with changes in that coverage and in how the states deliver and pay for health care. These states have focused especially on expanding the use of private health insurance, requiring beneficiaries to pay premiums, and incentivizing them to choose cost-effective care. By enabling states to link wider program reforms to the adult expansion, Section 1115 has allowed them to better align Medicaid with local political conditions while extending insurance to more than 1 million adults who would otherwise lack a pathway to coverage."

This coincides with a trend in medicine to reconsider population health approaches as part of the standard curriculum. This intersection of new policy and educational climates presents a unique opportunity to reconsider traditional healthcare structures. This paper introduces and advances an alignment that few have considered. We propose that accountable care organizations (ACOs), which are expected to proliferate under the ACA, present the best opportunity to establish partnerships between healthcare, public health, and community-based organizations to achieve the legislation's goals. One example is encouraging daily physical activity via built environment interventions and programs, which is recommended by numerous groups. We highlight how nonprofit organizations in Sacramento, California have been able to leverage influence, capital, and policy to encourage design for active living, and how their work is coordinating with public health and healthcare initiatives. In conclusion, we critically examine potential barriers to the success of partnerships between ACOs and community organizations and encourage further exploration and evaluation. © 2014 Elsevier Inc."

As the enactment of health care reform becomes a reality in the USA, it has been widely predicted that HIV+ patients will increasingly be cared for by primary care physicians (PCPs), many of whom lack the experience to deliver full-spectrum HIV care. Objective. To describe PCPs' preparedness for an influx of HIV+ patients. Methods. This qualitative study included interviews with 20 PCPs from community health centres in California. We inquired about clinicians' experiences with HIV, their strategies for dealing with unfamiliar aspects of medicine and their management of complicated patients. We also identified the clinicians' preferred types of information and consultation resources. Results. PCPs are not yet comfortable as providers of comprehensive HIV care; however, they are dedicated to delivering excellent care to all of their patients, regardless of disease process. Although they prefer to refer HIV+ patients to centres of excellence, they are willing to adopt full responsibility when necessary and believe they can deliver high-quality HIV care if provided with adequate consultation and informational resources. Conclusions. The Affordable Care Act will insure an estimated 20 000 more HIV+ patients in California. With a dwindling supply of HIV specialists, many of these patients will be principally cared for by PCPs. PCPs will go to great lengths to ensure that HIV+ patients receive superior care, but they need the support of HIV specialists to expand their skills. Priority should be given to ensuring that expert consultation is widely available to PCPs who find themselves caring for HIV+ patients. © The Author 2014. Published by Oxford University Press.

Readmission rates after thyroidectomy and parathyroidectomy and associated factors remain ill-defined. We evaluated patient and perioperative factors for association with readmission after thyroidectomy and parathyroidectomy.METHODS: The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Participant Use File (2011) data for thyroid (n = 3,711) and parathyroid (n = 3,358) resections were analyzed. Patient- and operation-related factors were assessed by univariate and multivariate analyses.RESULTS: Among 7,069 patients, 30-day readmission rate was 4.0%: 4.1% after thyroidectomy and 3.8% after parathyroidectomy. Significant associations for 30-day readmission included declining functional status (odds ratio [OR], 6.4-10.1), preoperative hemodialysis (OR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.5-4.7), malnutrition (OR, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.2-10.1), increasing American Society of Anesthesiologists class (OR 1.3-4.7), unplanned reoperation (OR, 61.6), and length of stay (LOS) <24 hours (OR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.45-0.85; all P < .05). Readmission was associated with greater total and postoperative LOS and major postoperative complications, including renal insufficiency (all P < .01).CONCLUSION: Thirty-day readmission after cervical endocrine resection occurs in 4% of patients. Discharge within 24 hours of operation does not affect the likelihood of readmission. Risk factors for readmission are multifactorial and driven by preoperative conditions. Decreasing the index hospital stay and preventing major postoperative complications may decrease readmissions and improve quality metrics. Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

Using data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, we provide evidence that health care reform in Massachusetts led to better overall self-assessed health. Various robustness checks and placebo tests support a causal interpretation of the results. We also document improvements in several determinants of overall health: physical health, mental health, functional limitations, joint disorders, and body mass index. Next, we show that the effects on overall health were strongest among those with low incomes, nonwhites, near-elderly adults, and women.

Since its foundation, it has adapted and evolved in response to the dynamic and ever-changing landscapes of health care, including the advent of healthcare maintenance organizations, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and development of patient-centered medical homes. To survive in this shifting climate, empirical evidence from core metrics is needed to track progress on healthcare quality, cost, patient and public engagement, and health outcomes (Institute of Medicine [IOM], 2013). In turn, these metrics may be used to earn favor by educators, clinicians, third-party payers, and policy makers for an integrated model of care.

Meanwhile, the demand for new, effective medical and drug treatments continues to rise as unhealthy lifestyles cause further increases in diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Global drug pricing is one of the most hotly debated yet least understood aspects of the pharmaceutical industry. How should drug prices be set and what does it mean for patients? Why do governments increasingly get involved, and what is its impact on the global competitive environment? How can a life-saving industry have a poorer image than gun and tobacco industries, whose products are associated with death? Ed Schoonveld explains how pharmaceutical prices are determined in a complex global payer environment and what factors influence the process. His insights will help a wide range of audiences, from healthcare industry professionals to policy makers and the broader public, to gain a better understanding of this highly complex and emotionally charged field. The Price of Global Health is recognized as a valued and unique reference book that covers a complete array of topics related to global pharmaceutical pricing. It contains an in-depth but straightforward exploration of the pharmaceutical pricing strategy process, its underlying market access, general business and ethical considerations, and its implications for payers, physicians and patients. It is a much-needed and invaluable resource for anybody interested or involved in, or affected by, the development, funding and use of prescription drugs. In particular, it is of critical importance to pharmaceutical company executives and other leaders and professionals in commercialization and drug development, including marketing, business development, market access and pricing, clinical development, drug discovery, regulatory affairs, health outcomes, market research and public affairs. The second edition includes new chapters on payer value story development, oncology, orphan drugs and payer negotiations. Furthermore, many country chapters have been substantially updated to reflect changes in the healthcare systems, including the Affordable Care Act in the US, AMNOG in Germany, medico-economic requirements in France and many other country-specific changes. Lastly, almost every chapter has been updated with new examples and illustrations. © Ed Schoonveld 2015. All rights reserved."

We sought to examine whether health information technology (HIT) use in primary care practices was associated with anticipated capacity to accept new patients.STUDY DESIGN: Secondary analysis of a cross-sectional survey of Michigan PCPs from the specialties of pediatrics, internal medicine, and family medicine, conducted from October to December 2012. HIT use was considered independently for 8 types of HIT and in aggregate as a total count of HIT in use. Primary care capacity was assessed as self-reported capacity to accept new patients.RESULTS: Of 739 respondents, 83% reported they anticipated capacity to accept new patients. In multivariable analysis, we found that physiians using a greater number of HITs were significantly less likely to anticipate capacity to accept new patients (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 0.86; 95% CI, 0.76-0.97). PCPs with higher HIT use were also less likely to accept patients with private insurance (adjusted OR 0.87; 95% CI, 0.77-0.97), but not with Medicaid (adjusted OR 0.94; 95% CI, 0.84-1.05) or Medicare (adjusted OR 0.91; 95% CI, 0.83-1.01). Among individual HITs, electronic health records (adjusted OR 0.54; 95% CI, 0.30-0.96) and electronic access to admitting hospital records (adjusted OR 0.46; 95% CI, 0.22-0.96) were the only HITs significantly associated with lower anticipated primary care capacity.CONCLUSIONS:  PCPs using a greater number of HITs were less likely to anticipate capacity to accept new patients. Implementation of HIT and other practice innovations must be carefully coordinated to optimize capacity to care for the newly insured."

Promoting appropriate use of TKR would help reduce disparities and improve outcomes. There are currently no validated appropriateness criteria (AC) for TKR in the US. We evaluated the performance of 2 non-US AC in a cohort of US TKR patients. Methods: AC1 was developed in Spain using the modified Delphi method with 624 patient scenarios. AC2 was developed in Canada using the overall Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index score of ≥39 as the cutoff point for surgery. These criteria were applied to a random sample of TKR patients enrolled in our institutional registry. Preoperative clinical, radiographic, and patient-reported survey data were used in classifying patients. The rate of appropriateness was compared for the 2 AC. Inappropriate cases were further investigated to determine other mitigating factors beyond the criteria influencing the decision to operate. Results: In total, 508 TKR procedures were evaluated. All patients had osteoarthritic radiographic changes. On the basis of AC1, 7.7% of cases were classified as inappropriate and 11.6% uncertain. On the basis of AC2, 31.5% were classified as inappropriate. Only 4.7% of the cases were classified as inappropriate by both ACs; however, there was poor agreement between the 2 AC (κ = −0.08). Beyond the criteria, failure of nonsurgical treatment and clinically significant valgus/varus deformities influenced the decision for surgery. Conclusion: There was poor agreement between 2 validated AC for TKR when tested in a US population. Culturally specific AC are needed to promote rational use of TKR.

HCAHPS is a national, standardized satisfaction survey. Patient responses form, in part, the basis for Medicare reimbursement to hospitals via the value-based purchasing system established by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010. We hypothesized that patients who developed an HAC would be less satisfied with their care.METHODS: We randomly distributed the HCAHPS survey, a validated, standardized measure of patient satisfaction, to 6,056 patients discharged from our institution for any orthopedic admission over a 2-year period. All patients who develop HACs are logged by our hospital quality assurance monitoring system. We reviewed the HCAHPS database, identified completed surveys associated with patients who had developed an HAC, and compared satisfaction scores between patients with HACs and patients without HACs. Survey scores were normalized to a 100-point scale. Univariate analysis was performed for two global ratings, and six specific satisfaction categories. Subgroup analysis was performed for surgical site infections (SSIs) and venous thromboembolic disease (VTE).RESULTS: A total of 2,876 controls and 159 HAC cases were identified from completed surveys. The cases and controls were similar in terms of race, however, the HAC group contained significantly more women (p < .001). Patients in the HAC group also were, on average, significantly older, with a mean age of 66.84 versus 58.65 (p < .001). There was no difference in satisfaction scores in patients' mean rating of communication by nurses (p = .81), communication by doctors (p = .31), communication about medications (p = .69), pain control (p = .66), the cleanliness of the hospital environment (p = .54), and the quietness of the hospital (p = .589). The mean normalized score for overall satisfaction was 93.99 (out of 100) for controls and 94.84 for HAC cases (p = .61). The mean normalized score for overall willingness to recommend the hospital to others was 90.22 for controls and 90.65 for HAC cases (p = .77). There was no statistically significant difference in satisfaction for patients with SSI versus VTE versus all other HACs (p > .05).DISCUSSION: Performance on HCAHPS is an area that demands hospital attention both to provide patient-centered care and to maximize revenue. Development of an HAC was not associated with decreased satisfaction scores in a population of orthopedic surgery patients at a private, university-affiliated specialty center. The lack of any statistically significant difference in patient satisfaction may be attributable to patient satisfaction with care in response to complications, the decreased sensitivity inherent to using a general satisfaction survey, or a homogeneity among orthopedic surgery patients and their expectations of care. © 2013 National Association for Healthcare Quality."

Historically, public health departments (HDs) have cared for most TB patients in the United States. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) provides coverage for uninsured persons and may increase the proportion of TB patients cared for by private medical providers and other providers outside HDs (PMPs). We sought to determine whether there were differences in care provided by HDs and PMPs to inform public health planning under the ACA.Methods: We conducted a retrospective, cross-sectional analysis of California TB registry data. We included adult TB patients with culture-positive, pulmonary TB reported in California during 2007-2011. We examined trends, described case characteristics, and created multivariate models measuring two standards of TB care in PMP- and HD-managed patients: documented culture conversion within 60 days, and use of directly observed therapy (DOT).Results: The proportion of PMP-managed TB patients increased during 2007-2011 (p =0.002). On univariable analysis (N = 4,606), older age, white, black or Asian/Pacific Islander race, and birth in the United States were significantly associated with PMP care (p<0.05). Younger age, Hispanic ethnicity, homelessness, drug or alcohol use, and cavitary and/or smear-positive TB disease, were associated with HD care. Multivariable analysis showed PMP care was associated with lack of documented culture conversion (adjusted relative risk [aRR] = 1.37, confidence interval [CI] 1.25-1.51) and lack of DOT (aRR = 8.56, CI 6.59-11.1).Conclusion: While HDs cared for TB cases with more social and clinical complexities, patients under PMP care were less likely to receive DOT and have documented culture conversion.

The act also increases coverage by allowing states to expand Medicaid (the social healthcare program for families and people with low income and resources) to cover everyone near the poverty line, and by subsidizing private insurance for people who are not poor but who do not have workplace coverage. The act allows most people to keep the same kind of insurance that they currently have, and it does not change how private insurance pays physicians and hospitals. Although the act falls short of achieving truly universal coverage, nine million uninsured people have received coverage so far. Market reforms have not hurt the insurance industry's profitability, prices for individual insurance have been lower than expected, and government costs so far have been less than initially projected. The act expands several ongoing pilot programs in Medicare that reform how doctors and hospitals are paid, but it does not directly change how private insurers pay healthcare providers. Nevertheless, it has set into motion market dynamics that are affecting medical practice, such as limiting insurance networks to fewer providers and requiring patients to pay for more treatment costs out of pocket. In response, many hospitals and physicians are forming closer and larger affiliations. Further time and study are needed to learn whether these evolutionary changes will achieve their goals without harming the doctor-patient relationship."

Describe value measurement in spine care and discuss the motivation for, methods for, and limitations of such measurement. Summary of Background Data. Spinal disorders are common and are an important cause of pain and disability. Numerous complementary and competing treatment strategies are used to treat spinal disorders, and the costs of these treatments is substantial and continue to rise despite clear evidence of improved health status as a result of these expenditures. Methods. The authors present the economic and legislative imperatives forcing the assessment of value in spine care. The definition of value in health care and methods to measure value specifically in spine care are presented. Limitations to the utility of value judgments and caveats to their use are presented. Results. Examples of value calculations in spine care are presented and critiqued. Methods to improve and broaden the measurement of value across spine care are suggested, and the role of prospective registries in measuring value is discussed. Conclusion. Value can be measured in spine care through the use of appropriate economic measures and patient-reported outcomes measures. Value must be interpreted in light of the perspective of the assessor, the duration of the assessment period, the degree of appropriate risk stratification, and the relative value of treatment alternatives. © 2014 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins."

Federal officials implemented this reform using transitional policies that left many important decisions to the states, while pledging to reassess that approach in time for the 2016 coverage year. This issue brief examines how states have exercised their options under the initial federal essential health benefits framework. We find significant variation in how states have developed their essential health benefits packages, including their approaches to benefit substitution and coverage of habilitative services. Federal regulators should use insurance company data describing enrollees' experiences with their coverage--information called for under the law's delayed transparency requirements--to determine whether states' differing strategies are producing the coverage improvements promised by reform."

Secretary of U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and Hobby Lobby Stores v. Sebelius, along with recent federal court decisions, has highlighted the ongoing controversy over the scope of the Affordable Care Act's (ACA's) contraceptive coverage requirement, which requires an employer to provide certain contraceptive coverage to its employees under its group health plan. Some employers have objected to the requirement, citing objections to the facilitation of the use of contraceptives in conflict with the religious tenets by which their businesses operate. An analogous issue has arisen in state courts in the context of same-sex weddings. Several private businesses that qualify as public accommodations have objected to state requirements that they provide services without discriminating based on sexual orientation despite the owners' religious objections to same-sex marriage. Theseissues have raised a novel legal question for the courts: What rights do secular businesses that operate for profit have to pursue legal claims to protect their religious exercise? Although a number of statutory exemptions exist to protect individuals and organizations' religious beliefs and objections (e.g., employment discrimination under Title VII, disability discrimination under the Americans with Disabilities Act, etc.), courts have applied those exemptions only to individuals and nonprofit, religious organizations. A number of legal challenges to the contraceptive coverage requirement have examined a range of questions related to the rights of these businesses. As a threshold question, courts have had to analyze whether the business itself is eligible for protection under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) and Free Exercise jurisprudence. The businesses have asserted that they qualify as ""persons"" under RFRA and, in the alternative, that they are entitled to pursue their claims on behalf of their owners under what is known as the ""pass-through"" theory of corporate rights. Courts have also considered whether the business owners may pursue independent legal claims asserting their objections, or if their individual rights are forfeited at the time of the company's incorporation. If a court determines that the business or its owners are eligible for free exercise protection, it may then consider the merits of the case, including whether the mandate constitutes a substantial burden on religious exercise; whether the government has a compelling interest to do so; and whether the government used the least restrictive means to achieve that interest. Five federal circuit courts have considered these questions in the context of the contraceptive coverage requirement, and have reached different conclusions on the range of questions raised. This report examines the constitutional and statutory protections related to free exercise of religion, including current Supreme Court interpretations, as well as judicial and legislative avoidance of defining the parameters of religious belief. It also discusses significant examples of existing religious exemptions in current law, including employment nondiscrimination, health care, and public accommodations law. Finally, it analyzes recent federal judicial decisions that have considered the religious freedom rights of commercial entities whose owners have religious objections to the contraceptive coverage requirement. © 2014 Nova Science Publishers, Inc."

These issues become particularly salient when Congress considers legislation to establish new immigration statuses or to create or modify benefit or entitlement programs. The 111th Congress enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (P.L. 111-148), which has been amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-152) and several other bills. (ACA refers to P.L. 111-148 as amended by P.L. 111-152 and the other legislation.) The ACA created new responsibilities (e.g., the requirement that most people in the United States obtain health insurance) and new benefits (e.g., tax credits to help certain people purchase health insurance), and it addressed the eligibility and responsibility of foreign nationals for these provisions. The 113th Congress is considering legislation that would amend or repeal the ACA. In addition, the 113th Congress is considering legislation that would reform the U.S. immigration system, including proposals to create new immigration statuses. One issue that has arisen during some debates to amend provisions in the ACA and during discussions of immigration reform is the eligibility of foreign nationals for some of the ACA's key provisions. At the center of noncitizen eligibility for provisions under the ACA is the term ""lawfully present."" Aliens who are ""lawfully present in the United States"" are generally subject to the health insurance mandate and are eligible, if otherwise qualified, to participate in the exchanges (the health insurance marketplace) and for the premium tax credit and costsharing subsidies available to certain individuals who purchase insurance through an exchange. For purposes of the ACA, ""lawfully present"" has been defined in regulation and includes lawful permanent residents (LPRs), asylees, refugees, foreign nationals admitted under any nonimmigrant visa who are in status, and certain other classifications under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). To purchase insurance through an exchange, a noncitizen must be expected to be lawfully present for the entire period of coverage. Although the minimum period of coverage was established by regulation as 12 months, the exchanges will decide on an enrollment period based on the length of time the alien is authorized to be in the country. The ACA bars foreign nationals who are not lawfully present from purchasing insurance through a health insurance exchange. In addition, certain individuals who purchase insurance through an exchange may be eligible for the premium tax credit and cost-sharing subsidies to help defray the cost of the insurance. To be eligible, an applicant must meet income requirements based on family size and the federal poverty level, and must also file a tax return in order to claim the credit. Noncitizens who are not lawfully present are ineligible for the premium credit and cost-sharing subsidies because they are barred from purchasing insurance through an exchange. To enforce the noncitizen eligibility requirements under the ACA, the act required the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a program to determine whether an individual who is to be covered in the individual market by a qualified health plan offered through an exchange or who is claiming a premium tax credit or cost-sharing subsidy is a citizen or national of the United States or an alien lawfully present in the United States. This system first checks the Social Security Administration (SSA) records. If SSA can confirm that the person is a citizen, then the check stops at that point. If the person is a ""noncitizen"" in SSA records, the system checks against Department of Homeland Security (DHS) records to confirm lawful presence. The Departments of Health and Human Services and Homeland Security have stated that no information collected as part of enrollment in an exchange plan will be used for any civil immigration enforcement actions. © 2014 Nova Science Publishers, Inc."

Using electronic health record data from 67 community health centers, we assessed pre- and postcoverage utilization among patients who gained insurance, compared with patients continuously insured or uninsured. In comparisons of the pre- and postcoverage periods, mean annual encounters among persons who gained insurance increased 22% to 35%, but declined in the comparison groups. These findings suggest that providers should expect a significant increase in demand among patients who gain Medicaid coverage through the Affordable Care Act."

In this brief, we estimate the number of workers potentially at risk of losing their jobs or having hours reduced. Most workers near the thresholds--those in firms with around 50 full-time-equivalent employees or those working near 30 hours per week--are already insured or have been offered coverage. There are 100,000 full-time workers at the firm-size threshold and 296,000 at the hourly threshold who are unin­sured. Fewer than 10 percent, less than 0.03 percent of the U.S. labor force, might see reduc­tions in employment or hours in the short run.

Often, they go to Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) and hospital emergency departments. Even after the implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), these safety-net health care organizations will continue to play a crucial role in the US health care system. FQHCs have long grappled with some of the biggest questions facing the US health care system and their leaders and clinicians face ethical challenges in everyday practice. Ethical and policy challenges in the US health care safety-net are not usually 'tragic choices' involving the allocation of transplantable organs, or ventilators during a pandemic. They are everyday choices with a tragic dimension because, even with the adoption of the ACA, the US has not yet decided whether poor people deserve a 'home' or a 'net' when they are sick, and whether even a net should be in good repair."

Currently, few SAT providers accept Medicaid, and consequently, there is concern that newly-eligible Medicaid enrollees will have difficulty finding SAT providers willing to serve them. However, little is known about why few SAT providers accept Medicaid. In response, this study examines how features of state Medicaid coverage for SAT, including benefits, eligibility, and oversight, are associated with Medicaid acceptance among SAT providers. Medicaid acceptance was positively associated with the number of SAT services covered, and the number of optional categorical expansions implemented by the state. Requirements for physician involvement were associated with lower odds of acceptance. The results suggest that more generous Medicaid coverage may encourage SAT providers to accept Medicaid, but regulatory policies may inhibit their ability to do so."

The program fills gaps in health insurance coverage for rural people, particularly low-income families and children, and elderly and disabled Medicare beneficiaries. For example, in 2010, over 42% of low-income rural children relied on the Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) as their source of coverage.[1] The Medicaid program is also a critical source of health care financing for the rural health system, including hospitals, doctors, and providers of long-term services and supports, and contributes significantly to local, rural economies by supporting health care and related employment. Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, (ACA) the importance of Medicaid in the rural health system will grow significantly. Expanding Medicaid eligibility is a key element of the ACA's strategy for achieving near-universal coverage, with over half of the expected gains in health insurance coverage coming from the Medicaid expansion.

This combination strategy is a preventive service that is required by the Affordable Care Act to be covered with no cost-sharing by most health insurance plans. The cotesting recommendation was made based entirely on prospective data from an insured population that may have a lower proportion of women with HPV positive and Pap negative results (ie, discordant results). The discordant group represents a very difficult group to manage. If the frequency of discordant results among underserved women is higher, health care providers may perceive the cotesting strategy to be a less favorable screening strategy than traditional Pap testing every 3 years.STUDY DESIGN: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Cervical Cancer Study was conducted at 15 clinics in 6 federally qualified health centers across Illinois. Providers at these clinics were given the option of cotesting for routine cervical cancer screening. Type-specific HPV detection was performed on residual extracts using linear array.RESULTS: Pap test results were abnormal in 6.0% and HPV was positive in 7.2% of the underserved women screened in this study (mean age, 45.1 years). HPV prevalence decreased with age, from 10.3% among 30- to 39-year-olds to 4.5% among 50- to 60-year-olds. About 5% of the women had a combination of a positive HPV test and normal Pap test results; HPV 16/18 was identified in 14% of discordant women.CONCLUSION: The rate of discordant results among underserved women was similar to those reported throughout the US in a variety of populations. Typing for HPV 16/18 appears to assist in the management in a small proportion of women with discordant results. Published by Elsevier Inc."

We performed a retrospective analysis to compare outcomes between Medicaid and non-Medicaid bariatric surgery patients over a two-year period.METHODS: All patients who underwent a laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass at The Ohio State University Medical Center from January 2008-April 2011 were identified. Of these 609 patients, 30 Medicaid patients were identified and compared to 90 randomly selected non-Medicaid patients (1:3 case-control). Preoperative data and postoperative outcome data (weight loss, comorbidity resolution, complications, and mortality) were obtained from electronic medical records. Descriptive statistical analyses were performed to compare categorical and continuous variables.RESULTS: Medicaid patients had a significantly higher average BMI (58.4 vs. 49.5; p < 0.001) and higher rates of comorbidities. Over a 90-day postoperative period, Medicaid patients experienced a higher wound complication rate (20.0 vs. 5.6 %; p = 0.03) and visited the ER more frequently (33.3 vs. 10.0 %; p = 0.007) but had similar rates of medical complications compared to non-Medicaid patients. The Medicaid cohort lost 52.1 % of its excess body weight vs. 64.6 % for the non-Medicaid cohort (p = 0.02) over a two-year period. There were no significant differences in comorbidity resolution, anastomotic complications, or mortality after 2 years of follow-up.CONCLUSION: Despite being a higher risk cohort, Medicaid patients undergoing laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass had similar long-term outcomes compared to non-Medicaid patients."

Four focus groups were conducted using consecutive sampling of Iraqi refugee parents residing in the US for 8 months to 5 years. Eight key-informant interviews also were conducted with employees of organizations serving Iraqi refugee families, recruited using snowball sampling. Focus groups and interviews were audiotaped, transcribed, and analyzed using margin coding and grounded theory. Iraqi refugees identified provider availability, Medicaid maintenance and renewal, language issues, and inadequate recognition of post-traumatic stress disorder as barriers to care for their children. Interviewees cited loss of case-management services and difficulties in understanding the Medicaid renewal process as barriers. Potential interventions to improve access include community-oriented efforts to educate parents on Medicaid renewal, obtaining services, and accessing specialists. Given the enduring nature of language and Medicaid renewal barriers, policies addressing eligibility alone are insufficient. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York."

Our sample consisted of 5,003 individuals with AUD with a comorbid mood or anxiety disorder and 6,734 individuals with AUD but without mood or anxiety disorder comorbidity.RESULTS: The group with mood or anxiety disorder comorbidity was more likely to seek alcohol treatment than the group without such comorbidity (18 vs. 12 %, p < 0.001). The comorbid group was also more likely to perceive an unmet need for such treatment (8 vs. 3 %, p < 0.001) and to report a larger number of barriers (2.81 vs. 2.20, p = 0.031). Individuals with AUD with comorbid mood or anxiety disorders were more likely than those without to report financial barriers to alcohol treatment (19 vs. 10 %, p = 0.032).CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with AUD and comorbid mood or anxiety disorders would likely benefit from the expansion of financial access to alcohol treatments and integration of services envisioned under the Affordable Care Act."

This coincides with a trend in medicine to reconsider population health approaches as part of the standard curriculum. This intersection of new policy and educational climates presents a unique opportunity to reconsider traditional healthcare structures. This paper introduces and advances an alignment that few have considered. We propose that accountable care organizations (ACOs), which are expected to proliferate under the ACA, present the best opportunity to establish partnerships between healthcare, public health, and community-based organizations to achieve the legislation's goals. One example is encouraging daily physical activity via built environment interventions and programs, which is recommended by numerous groups. We highlight how nonprofit organizations in Sacramento, California have been able to leverage influence, capital, and policy to encourage design for active living, and how their work is coordinating with public health and healthcare initiatives. In conclusion, we critically examine potential barriers to the success of partnerships between ACOs and community organizations and encourage further exploration and evaluation. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

From a relatively narrow discipline focused on regulating relationships among individual patients, health care providers, and third-party payers, it is expanding into a far broader field with a burgeoning commitment to access to health care and assurance of healthy living conditions as matters of social justice. Through a series of incremental reform efforts stretching back decades before the Affordable Care Act and encompassing public health law as well as the law of health care financing and delivery, reducing health disparities has become a central focus of American health law and policy. This Article labels, describes, and furthers a nascent ""health justice"" movement by examining what it means to view health law as an instrument of social justice. Drawing on the experiences of the reproductive justice, environmental justice, and food justice movements, and on the writings of political philosophers and ethicists on health justice, I propose that health justice offers an alternative to the market competition and patient rights paradigms that currently dominate health law scholarship, advocacy, and reform. I then examine the role of law in reducing health disparities through the health justice lens. I argue that the nascent health justice framework suggests three commitments for the use of law to reduce health disparities. First, to a broader inquiry that views access to health care as one among many social determinants of health deserving of public attention and resources. Second, to probing inquiry into the effects of class, racial, and other forms of social and cultural bias on the design and implementation of measures to reduce health disparities. And third, to collective action grounded in community engagement and participatory parity. In exploring these commitments, I highlight tensions within the social justice framework and between the social justice framework and the nascent health justice movement. These tensions illustrate, rather than undermine, the power of viewing health law as social justice. They raise important questions that should prompt more fruitful and rigorous thinking within health law activism and scholarship and with regard to the relationships between law and social justice more broadly."

Multiple linear regression analysis was used to evaluate the association between inpatient hospitalization charges and complications, sociodemographic status, comorbidities, readmission, length of stay, admission type, region, procedures, payer type, and hospitalization misadventures.RESULTS: Diabetes-related adjusted hospitalization charges were higher for those with long-term complications [renal manifestations (75%), peripheral circulatory disorders (38%), neurological manifestations (30%), ophthalmic manifestations (16%)], acute complications [ketoacidosis (48%), hyperosmolarity (41%), coma (40%)], amputations (91%) or other medical procedure(s) (70%), emergency/urgent admissions (7%), comorbidity (3% per modified Charlson Comorbidity Index score item), medical misadventure (20%), different regions [Philadelphia (135%), and Pittsburgh (8%)], and for minorities [non-Hispanic black (12%), Hispanic (21%), and non-Hispanic other (14%)]. Readmission adjusted charges were not different from the initial admission charges.CONCLUSIONS: To reduce diabetes-related hospitalizations and curb hospitalization charges, public health and healthcare policy makers should be cognizant of high-impact drivers: diabetes-related complications, unnecessary procedures, race/ethnicity, and region. Inpatient are should focus on preventing unnecessary readmissions and misadventures. These findings are timely as the Affordable Care Act reduces Medicare payments to hospitals with high readmission rates, and as states consider Medicaid expansion."

However, despite their widespread use, including in pay-for-performance and public reporting efforts and various provisions of the Affordable Care Act, knowledge about the use of CAHPS in assessing the impact of quality improvement efforts is limited. A study was conducted to examine the use of patient experience surveys in assessing the impact of innovations implemented in health care settings. Methods: Innovation profiles identified on the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Health Care Innovations Exchange website that included patient experience (including patient satisfaction) as an outcome (N = 201), were analyzed with a variety of qualitative analysis methods. Results: Fewer than half of the innovations used a patient experience measure, most commonly employing global measures such as an overall rating. Most innovations assessed patient experience at a single time point, with only one third using techniques such as pre-post comparisons, time trends, or comparisons to control groups. Ten domains of measures addressed reports of patient experience, all of which could be assessed by existing CAHPS instruments. Similarly, CAHPS measures are available to assess all of the organizational processes that are addressed by innovations in the profiles and for which patients are the best source of information. While 120 of the innovations that use patient experience measures report using surveys to collect these data, only 6 reported using a CAHPS measure. Conclusions: Although innovations targeting quality improvement are often evaluated using surveys, there is considerable untapped potential for using CAHPS measures or surveys to assess their effectiveness.

This article demonstrates how hospitals and clinicians can use their own structured discharge data to create decision trees that produce highly transparent, clinically relevant decision rules for better managing readmission risk associated with AMI, HF, and PN. For illustrative purposes, basic decision trees are trained and tested using publically available data from the California State Inpatient Databases and an open-source statistical package. As expected, these simple models perform less well than other more sophisticated tools, with areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (or AUC) of 0.612, 0.583, and 0.650, respectively, but achieve a lift of at least 1.5 or greater for higher-risk patients with any of the three conditions. More importantly, they are shown to offer substantial advantages in terms of transparency and interpretability, comprehensiveness, and adaptability. By enabling hospitals and clinicians to identify important factors associated with readmissions, target subgroups of patients at both high and low risk, and design and implement interventions that are appropriate to the risk levels observed, decision trees serve as an ideal application for addressing the challenge of reducing hospital readmissions. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland."

Integration of clinical HIV and MH services has been shown to improve quality of life and physical and MH of people living with HIV/AIDS. However, few studies have investigated the practice of service integration systematically. We examined the practice patterns of 515 direct service providers in New York State who received training about HIV MH between May 2010 and July 2012. We sought to identify provider and treatment setting characteristics associated with an integrated spectrum of care. Using factor analysis and linear modeling, we found that patterns of service integration varied by type of health-care setting, service setting location, providers' HIV caseload, and the discipline of the provider describing the direct services. Understanding the existing capacities of clinicians providing care in a variety of settings throughout New York will help to guide staffing and linkage to enhance HIV MH service integration as significant shifts in the organization of health care occur. © 2014 Taylor & Francis."

The extent to which immigrant families are aware of and interested in obtaining insurance for their children is unclear. METHODS: Data from the 2011-2012 National Survey of Children's Health were analyzed to examine differences by immigrant generational status in awareness of children's health insurance options. Adjusted odds ratios (AORs) were calculated for each outcome variable that showed statistical significance by generation status. RESULTS: Barriers to obtaining insurance for children in immigrant (first- and second-generation) families include awareness of and experience with various health insurance options, perceived costs and benefits of insurance, structural/policy restrictions on eligibility, and lower likelihood of working in large organizations that offer employee insurance coverage. Although noncitizen immigrants are not covered by ACA insurance expansions, only 38% of first-generation families report being uninsured because of the inability to meet citizenship requirements. Most families in this sample also worked for employers with <50 employees, making them less likely to benefit from expansions in employer-based insurance. In multivariate analyses, third-generation families have increased odds of knowing how to enroll in health insurance (AOR 7.1 [3.6-13.0]) and knowing where to find insurance information (AOR 7.7 [3.8-15.4]) compared with first-generation families.

Previous studies of survivors of childhood cancer found lower rates of insurance and less access to medical care compared with siblings; however, to the authors' knowledge, no studies to date have examined continuity of insurance after a cancer diagnosis in adolescents and young adults (AYAs). METHODS Using the AYA Health Outcomes and Patient Experience study, a cohort of 465 individuals aged 15 to 39 years from participating Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registries, we evaluated changes in and sponsors of health insurance coverage after diagnosis, coverage of physician-recommended tests, and factors associated with lack of insurance after a cancer diagnosis using chi-square tests and multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS Greater than 25% of AYA survivors of cancer (118 survivors) experienced some period without insurance up to 35 months after diagnosis. Insurance rates were high in the initial year after diagnosis (6 months-14 months; 93.3%) but decreased substantially at follow-up (15 months-35 months; 85.2%). The most common sponsor of health insurance was employer/school coverage (43.7%). Multivariable analysis indicated that older survivors (those aged 25-39 years vs 15-19 years; odds ratio, 3.35 [P < .01]) and those with less education (high school or less vs college graduate; odds ratio, 2.80 [P < .01]) were more likely to experience a period without insurance after diagnosis. Furthermore, > 20% of survivors indicated there were physician-recommended tests/treatments that were not covered by insurance, but > 80% received them regardless of coverage. CONCLUSIONS Insurance rates appear to decrease with time since diagnosis in AYA survivors of cancer. Future studies should examine how new policies under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act extend access and insurance coverage beyond initial treatment. © 2014 American Cancer Society.

We aimed to model the financial costs and benefits of operating an MET and determine the annual reduction in critical deterioration (CD) events required to offset MET costs. METHODS: We performed a single-center cohort study between July 1, 2007 and March 31, 2012 to determine the cost of CD events (unplanned transfers to the ICU with mechanical ventilation or vasopressors in the 12 hours after transfer) as compared with transfers to the ICU without CD. We then performed a cost-benefit analysis evaluating varying MET compositions and staffing models (freestanding or concurrent responsibilities) on the annual reduction in CD events needed to offset MET costs. RESULTS: Patients who had CD cost $99 773 (95% confidence interval, $69 431 to $130 116; P < .001) more during their post-event hospital stay than transfers to the ICU that did not meet CD criteria. Annual MET operating costs ranged from $287 145 for a nurse and respiratory therapist team with concurrent responsibilities to $2 358 112 for a nurse, respiratory therapist, and ICU attending physician freestanding team. In base-case analysis, a nurse, respiratory therapist, and ICU fellow team with concurrent responsibilities cost $350 698 per year, equivalent to a reduction of 3.5 CD events. CONCLUSIONS: CD is expensive. The costs of operating a MET can plausibly be recouped with a modest reduction in CD events. Hospitals reimbursed with bundled payments could achieve real financial savings by reducing CD with an MET. Copyright © 2014 by the American Academy of Pediatrics."

Massachusetts implemented major health reform in 2006; little is known about the impact of this state's health reform on uninsurance, access to care, and financial protection for privately and publicly insured CSHCN. METHODS: We used a difference-in-differences (DD) approach to compare uninsurance, access to primary and specialty care, and financial protection in Massachusetts versus other states and Washington, DC before and after Massachusetts health reform. Parent-reported data were used from the 2005-2006 and 2009-2010 National Survey of Children with Special Health Care Needs and adjusted for age, gender, race/ethnicity, non-English language at home, and functional difficulties. RESULTS: Postreform, living in Massachusetts was not associated with significant decreases in uninsurance or increases in access to primary care for CSHCN. For privately insured CSHCN, Massachusetts was associated with increased access to specialists (DD = 6.0%; P ≤ .001) postreform. For publicly insured CSHCN, however, there was a significant decrease in access to prescription medications (DD = -7.2%; P = .003) postreform. Living in Massachusetts postreform was not associated with significant changes in financial protection compared with privately or publicly insured CSHCN in other states. CONCLUSIONS: Massachusetts health reform likely improved access to specialists for privately insured CSHCN but did not decrease instances of uninsurance, increase access to primary care, or improve financial protection for CSHCN in general. Comparable provisions within the Affordable Care Act may produce similarly modest outcomes for CSHCN. Copyright © 2014 by the American Academy of Pediatrics."

Electronic health records (EHRs) provide crucial information to providers treating individual patients, to health systems, including public health officials, about the health of populations, and to researchers about the determinants of health and the effectiveness of treatment. Inclusion of social and behavioral health domains in EHRs is vital to all three uses. The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act place new importance on the widespread adoption and meaningful use of EHRs. ""Meaningful use"" in a health information technology context refers to the use of EHRs and related technology within a health care organization to achieve specified objectives. Achieving meaningful use also helps determine whether an organization can receive payments from the Medicare EHR Incentive Program or the Medicaid EHR Incentive Program. Capturing Social and Behavioral Domains in Electronic Health Records is the first phase of a two-phase study to identify domains and measures that capture the social determinants of health to inform the development of recommendations for meaningful use of EHRs. This report identifies specific domains to be considered by the Office of the National Coordinator, specifies criteria that should be used in deciding which domains should be included, identifies core social and behavioral domains to be included in all EHRs, and identifies any domains that should be included for specific populations or settings defined by age, socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity, disease, or other characteristics. © 2014 by the National Academy of Sciences.

This article examines relationships among scores of the 3 reviewer types, changes in scoring after in-person discussion, and the effect of inclusion of patient and stakeholder reviewers on the review process. In the first phase, 363 scientists scored 480 applications. In the second phase, 59 scientists, 21 patients, and 31 stakeholders provided a ""prediscussion"" score and a final ""postdiscussion"" score after an in-person meeting for applications. Bland-Altman plots were used to characterize levels of agreement among and within reviewer types before and after discussion. Before discussion, there was little agreement among average scores given by the 4 lead scientific reviewers and patient and stakeholder reviewers. After discussion, the 4 primary reviewers showed mild convergence in their scores, and the 21-member panel came to a much stronger agreement. Of the 25 awards with the best (and lowest) scores after phase 2, only 13 had ranked in the top 25 after the phase 1 review by scientists. Five percent of the 480 proposals submitted were funded.

This article analyzes the implications of health system reforms in the United States and China for national pharmaceutical markets. It follows a historical institutionalist approach that identifies path dependency in the design and operation of national health systems. On that basis, we estimate prescription sales for 2015 and 2020, analyze the sustainability of free-market pricing for drugs in the two countries, and assess future competitive dynamics in the pharmaceutical sector. Methods: The institutional trajectories of health system reform and insurance coverage were studied for the United States and China. Next, data were collected from government, industry, and analyst reports on total healthcare spending and prescription drug expenditure by insurance status (in the United States) and by site of care (in China). Simple quantitative models were developed to estimate future drug spending based on insurance coverage, treatment locations, and health spending as a percentage of GDP. Results: Both countries will see rising total pharmaceutical spending and will be the two largest country markets for prescription drugs through at least 2020. In dollar terms, the U.S. pharmaceutical market will be over $440 billion in 2015 and $700 billion in 2020; China’s prescription market will be over $155 billion in 2015 and grow further to $260 billion in 2020. In both countries, generics will increase their share of all prescriptions, but economic and structural incentives for new drug invention and brand-name prescribing by physicians will keep the share of patented drug sales high compared to countries with more direct government control over the pharmaceutical market. Conclusions: Expanding private insurance contributes to spending on branded drugs, since insurers compete for market share rather than cost savings. Health system reforms presently being enacted in the United States and China align to historical institutional trajectories in each country, but leave unresolved a core tension between incentives for new drug invention and universal access to affordable medicines. © 2014 Daemmrich and Mohanty; licensee BioMed Central Ltd."

However, because states remain the primary regulators of health insurance and have considerable flexibility over implementation of the law, consumers are likely to experience some of the new protections differently, depending on where they live. This brief explores how federal reforms are shaping standards for individual insurance and exam­ines specific areas in which states have flexibility when implementing the new protections. We find that consumers nationwide will enjoy improved protections in each area targeted by the reforms. Further, some states already have embraced the opportunity to customize their markets by implementing consumer protec­tions that exceed minimum federal requirements. States likely will continue to adjust their market rules as policymakers gain a greater understanding of how reform is working for consumers."

The law, among other things, reauthorizes the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (P.L. 94-437, IHCIA), which authorizes many programs and services provided by the Indian Health Service (IHS). In addition, it makes several changes that may affect American Indians and Alaska Natives enrolled in and receiving services from the Medicare, Medicaid, and State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP)-also called Social Security Act (SSA) health benefit programs. The ACA also includes changes to private health insurance that may affect American Indians and Alaska Natives and may affect tribes that offer private health insurance. IHCIA authorizes many IHS programs and services, sets out the national policy for health services administered to Indians, and articulates the federal goal of ensuring the highest possible health status for Indians, including urban Indians. In addition, it authorizes direct collections from Medicare, Medicaid, and other third-party insurers. Prior to the ACA, IHCIA was last reauthorized in FY2000, although programs continued to receive appropriations in later years. The ACA reauthorizes IHCIA and extends authorizations of appropriations for IHCIA programs indefinitely. It amends a number of sections of IHCIA in general, to permit tribal organizations (TOs) and urban Indian organizations (UIOs) to apply for contract and grant programs for which they were not previously eligible; to create new mental health prevention and treatment programs; and to require demonstration projects to construct modular and mobile health facilities in order to expand health services available through IHS, Indian Tribes (ITs), and TOs.

It requires IHS to establish an Office of Direct Service Tribes to serve tribes that receive their health care and other services directly from IHS as opposed to receiving services through IHS-funded facilities or programs operated by ITs or TOs. In addition, the law requires IHS to develop a plan to establish a new area office to serve tribes in Nevada and requires the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to appoint a new IHS Director of HIV/AIDS Prevention and Treatment. In addition to reauthorizing IHCIA, the ACA includes a number of provisions that may affect American Indians and Alaska Natives who have private insurance coverage or who receive services through SSA health benefit programs. With regard to private insurance coverage, the ACA provides a special enrollment period for American Indians and Alaska Natives who may enroll in private insurance offered through an exchange and exempts certain American Indians and Alaska Natives from the requirement to obtain insurance coverage. Under regulation, additional American Indians and Alaska Natives may also be exempt from the ACA requirement to obtain insurance coverage. With regard to SSA health benefit programs, the new law permits specified Indian entities to determine Medicaid and CHIP eligibility and extends the period during which IHS, IT, and TO services are reimbursed for all Medicare Part B services, indefinitely, beginning January 1, 2010. Prior to the ACA, authority for these facilities to receive Medicare Part B reimbursements for certain specified services had expired on January 1, 2010. © 2014 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Despite continued growth of this vulnerable population, legislation between 1986 and 2013 has made it more difficult for states to provide adequate and cost-effective care. As this population ages and develops chronic illnesses, Texas physicians, health care administrators, and legislators will be facing a major challenge. New legislation, such as the Affordable Care Act and immigration reform, does not address or attempt to solve the issue of providing health care to this population. One example of inadequate care and poor resource allocation is the experience of undocumented immigrants with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). In Texas, these immigrants depend on safety net hospital systems for dialysis treatments. Often, treatments are provided only when their conditions become an emergency, typically at a higher cost, with worse outcomes. This article reviews the legislation regarding health care for undocumented immigrants, particularly those with chronic illnesses such as ESRD, and details specific challenges facing Texas physicians in the future."

We examined the association between insurance status and cancer-specific outcomes among young adults. Methods: We used the SEER program to identify 39,447 patients age 20 to 40 years diagnosed with a malignant neoplasm between 2007 and 2009. The association between insurance status and stage at presentation, employment of definitive therapy, and all-cause mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic or Cox regression, as appropriate. Results: Patients who were uninsured were more likely to be younger, male, nonwhite, and unmarried than patients who were insured and were also more likely to be from regions of lower income, education, and population density (P < .001 in all cases). After adjustment for pertinent confounding variables, an association between insurance coverage and decreased likelihood of presentation with metastatic disease (odds ratio [OR], 0.84; 95% CI, 0.75 to 0.94; P = .003), increased receipt of definitive treatment (OR, 1.95; 95% CI, 1.52 to 2.50; P < .001), and decreased death resulting from any cause (hazard ratio, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.65 to 0.91; P = .002) was noted. Conclusion: The improved coverage fostered by the ACA may translate into better outcomes among most young adults with cancer.

Tuberculosis has re-emerged as a major public health challenge with inadequate diagnosis and treatment within the homeless population considered a major contributing factor. Studies indicate that homeless individuals are three to nine times more likely to be HIV positive than those residing in stable housing situations, largely attributable to risky behaviors such as unprotected sex and the use of injectable, illegal substances. Finally, 20% to 30% of those without a permanent residence suffer from severe mental illness, increasing the risk of alcohol and substance abuse as well as the likelihood of involvement with the criminal justice system. The implementation of assertive community treatment can be highly effective in reducing homelessness, hospitalization and symptom severity outcomes among homeless individuals. However, the transient nature of this population combined with limited resources limits the ability to sustain and expand these successful interventions. Health information technology (health IT) may be the key to overcoming these obstacles. Through the use of electronic health records (EHRs), the electronic exchange of health information, and the use of innovative technologies such as mobile health and telemedicine, it is becoming increasingly possible to capture, exchange, and transfer information on the homeless while providing more consistent, accessible, and effective care. Some particularly effective examples of the use of health IT in improving health among the homeless population include: the accessibility of a transient patient's medical history across all health care providers regardless of location; the exchange of information including immunization status, behavioral health, and needed social supports across entities that provide services; and the provisions of timely access to medical services, counseling, and patient activation tools to better manage of chronic conditions. A number of facilities that serve individuals who are homeless have utilized health IT to development interventions that assist in the treatment of cardiovascular disease/hypertension, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, and behavioral health. In the course of incorporating these technologies, many of these provides and facilities have identified effective strategies to provide care that includes the following: implementing the Chronic Care Model using health IT; accessing enhanced funding from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to procure, implement, and maintain these technologies; leveraging federal and state resources available under the Affordable Care Act; and incorporating various innovative modalities for behavioral health and chronic disease management. © 2014 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

This provision is intended to recognize the disadvantaged financial situation of those hospitals because low-income patients are more likely to be uninsured or Medicaid enrollees. Hospitals often do not receive payment for services rendered to uninsured patients, and Medicaid provider payment rates are generally lower than the rates paid by Medicare and private insurance. As with most Medicaid expenditures, the federal government reimburses states for a portion of their Medicaid DSH expenditures based on each state's federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP). While most federal Medicaid funding is provided on an open-ended basis, federal Medicaid DSH funding is capped. Each state receives an annual DSH allotment, which is the maximum amount of federal matching funds that each state is permitted to claim for Medicaid DSH payments. In FY2012, federal DSH allotments totaled $11.4 billion. The health insurance coverage provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA, P.L. 111-148 as amended) are expected to reduce the number of uninsured individuals in the United States, which means there should be less need for Medicaid DSH payments. As a result, the ACA included a provision directing the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to make aggregate reductions in federal Medicaid DSH allotments for each year from FY2014 to FY2020. Since the ACA, three laws have amended the DSH reductions. The Supreme Court's decision regarding the ACA Medicaid expansion does not impact these DSH reduction amounts, but states' decisions about implementing the ACA Medicaid expansion could impact the allocation of the DSH reductions across states starting in FY2016. While there are some federal requirements that states must follow in defining DSH hospitals and calculating DSH payments, for the most part, states are provided significant flexibility. One way the federal government restricts states' Medicaid DSH payments is that the federal statute limits the amount of DSH payments for Institutions for Mental Disease and other mental health facilities. Since Medicaid DSH allotments were implemented in FY1993, total Medicaid DSH expenditures (i.e., including federal and state expenditures) have remained relatively stable. Over this same period of time, total Medicaid DSH expenditures as a percentage of total Medicaid medical assistance expenditures (i.e., including both federal and state expenditures but excluding expenditures for administrative activities) dropped from 13% to 4%. This report provides an overview of Medicaid DSH. It includes a description of the rules delineating how state DSH allotments are calculated and the exceptions to the rules, how DSH hospitals are defined, and how DSH payments are calculated. The DSH allotment section includes information about how the ACA DSH reductions may be allocated among the states, and the possible implications of the Supreme Court's decision regarding the ACA Medicaid expansion. The DSH expenditures section shows the trends in DSH spending and explains variation in states' DSH expenditures. Finally, the basic requirements for state DSH reports and independently certified audits are also outlined. © 2013 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved."

The disproportionate burden of unintended pregnancy, breast and cervical cancer, and sexually transmitted diseases among minority groups, teens, and young adults in the US underscore the need for affordable access to such services. However, increased access to sexual and reproductive health services, resulting from the Affordable Care Act (ACA) create questions regarding the continued need for this program. Methods. A study was conducted to assess clients' perceptions of Title X-funded family planning clinics and their preferences for these clinics for a range of sexual and reproductive health services. An anonymous, self-administered, paper-and-pencil survey was administered to 696 clients who received services from one of eight Title X-funded family planning clinics in Northeast Ohio. Results: The majority of participants stated very positive perceptions of the Title X-funded clinics; that they ""Always"" go to the Title X-funded clinic for birth control, STD/HIV testing, and pregnancy testing; and that the Title X-funded clinic was their regular source of health care. Females were more likely than males to prefer the Title X clinic for birth control, physical exams, pregnancy testing, and health information and more teens under the age of 18 preferred to use the Title X clinic for STD/HIV testing, physical exams, pregnancy testing, and health information. Conclusions: Findings indicate that these Title X-funded family planning clinics successfully reached populations in need of sexual and reproductive health services and suggest that these facilities can help play an important role in reducing disparities even after full implementation of the Affordable Care Act. However, more research is needed to fully quantify the need and value of Title X-funded family planning clinics and its relation to the changing health care environment in the US. © 2014 Oglesby; licensee BioMed Central Ltd."

It is unknown whether major changes in population insurance coverage can affect readmission rates, despite the Affordable Care Act's coverage expansions coming into effect this year. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of a large-scale insurance expansion on hospital readmissions, using Massachusetts' 2006 health reform as a natural experiment. DESIGN: Difference-in-difference time-series design. SETTING: All Massachusetts acute-care hospitals. PATIENTS: Inpatient visits from 2004 to 2010. MEASUREMENTS: Primary outcome was the hospital 30-day readmission rate. Readmissions to any Massachusetts hospital were tracked. RESULTS: Decreases in uninsurance rates during and after reform were largely limited to the hospital quartile with the highest prereform uninsurance rates (from 14% uninsured at the start of the reform to 2.9% by the end of the study period). The other hospitals collectively experienced a smaller decline in their uninsured admissions (5.9% at the start of reform to 2.5% by the end of the study period). According to difference-in-difference regression analysis, the highest uninsured hospital quartile experienced a modest increase in their unadjusted readmission rate of 0.6 percentage points (95% confidence interval: 0.1%-1.1%) during the reform period as compared to the other hospital quartiles (P=0.01). This represents a relative increase of 4.5% in the readmission rate. Risk-adjusted readmission rates showed no corresponding change. CONCLUSIONS: The Affordable Care Act's insurance expansion may be associated with an increase in unadjusted readmission rates among hospitals that cared for disproportionate numbers of uninsured patients. Risk-adjustment appears to take this effect into account. © 2014 Society of Hospital Medicine."

Results: Fifty-three percent of the clinic sample and 13% of the NHIS sample reported delays, most because of difficulties accessing services. In the clinic sample, delays were associated with receipt of routine care at a public clinic, rather than a physician's office; more severe depressive symptoms; and functional difficulties.

The evidence shows onerous out-of-pocket payments causing them to forgo needed care, miss work, and fall into bankruptcies and foreclosures. Nonetheless, many higher-paid workers are ""overinsured"": the evidence shows that in this domain, surplus insurance stimulates spending and price inflation without improving health. Employers can solve these problems together by scaling cost-sharing to wages. This reform would make insurance better protect against risk and guarantee access to care, while maintaining or even reducing insurance premiums. Yet, there are legal obstacles to scaled cost-sharing. The group-based nature of employer health insurance, reinforced by federal law, makes it difficult for scaling to be achieved through individual choices. The Affordable Care Act's (ACA) ""essential coverage"" mandate also caps cost-sharing even for wealthy workers that need no such cap. Additionally, there is a tax distortion in favor of highly paid workers purchasing healthcare through insurance rather than out-of-pocket. These problems are all surmountable. In particular, the ACA has expanded the applicability of an unenforced employee-benefits rule that prohibits ""discrimination"" in favor of highly compensated workers. A novel analysis shows that this statute gives the Internal Revenue Service the authority to require scaling and to thereby eliminate the current inequities and inefficiencies caused by the tax distortion. The promise is smarter insurance for over 150 million Americans."

Services formerly paid with state mental health funds have been converted to Medicaid, lightening the burden on state budgets affected by recession and other factors. The change has allowed states to maintain community care and inpatient services (in general hospitals). Medicaid service benefits include clinic and inpatient care, case management, and some rehabilitation services. But using Medicaid to finance some high-priority services such as supported employment has proven difficult. Now critical changes in Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act allow states to amend their Medicaid State Plans to provide more flexible services to people with serious mental illness. Advocacy and support may be needed to encourage this step. A national campaign to finance supported employment would join various stakeholders in the field, including professional organizations, family and service user groups, and organizations representing service providers.

We estimated that hospital revenue from ED care exceeded costs for that care by $6.1 billion in 2009, representing a profit margin of 7.8 percent (net revenue expressed as a percentage of total revenue). However, this is primarily because hospitals make enough profit on the privately insured ($17 billion) to cover underpayment from all other payer groups, such as Medicare, Medicaid, and unreimbursed care.

(1) State-level decisions in implementing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA) have led to significant state variation in the design of Health Insurance Marketplace (HIM) rating areas. In some designs, rural counties are grouped together, while in others, rural and urban counties have been deliberately mixed. (2) Urban counties have, on average, approximately one more firm participating in the marketplaces, representing about 11 more plan offerings, than rural counties have. (3) The highest-valued ""platinum"" plan types are less likely to be available in rural areas. Thus, the overall mix of plan types should be factored into the reporting of average premiums. (4) Levels of competition are likely to have a greater impact on the decisions of firms considering whether to operate in higher-cost areas or not, as those firms must determine how they can pass such costs on to consumers, conditional on the market share they are likely to control."

We estimated providers' uncompensated care costs in 2013 to be between $74.9 billion and $84.9 billion. We calculated that in the aggregate, at least 65 percent of providers' uncompensated care costs were offset by government payments designed to cover the costs. Medicaid and Medicare were the largest sources of such government payments, providing $13.5 billion and $8.0 billion, respectively. Anticipating fewer uninsured people and lower levels of uncompensated care, the Affordable Care Act reduces certain Medicare and Medicaid payments. Such cuts in government funding of uncompensated care could pose challenges to some providers, particularly in states that have not adopted the Medicaid expansion or where implementation of health care reform is proceeding slowly."

Using data from the 2009 California Health Interview Survey (CHIS), we developed a model that estimated the state's adult and child undocumented immigrant population, since the survey does not explicitly inquire about undocumented status. The survey also provided information on insurance status, doctor visits, and ED visits in the previous year. We found that undocumented immigrants in California, and the uninsured among them, had fewer or similar numbers of doctor visits, ED visits, and preventive services use compared to US citizens and other immigrant groups.

This article provides evidence on the stability of nongroup coverage using US census data for the period 2008-11, before ACA provisions took effect. The principal findings are threefold. First, this market was characterized by high turnover: Only 42 percent of people with nongroup coverage at the outset of the study period retained that coverage after twelve months. Second, 80 percent of people experiencing coverage changes acquired other insurance within a year, most commonly from an employer. Third, turnover varied across groups, with stable coverage more common for whites and self-employed people than for other groups. Turnover was particularly high among adults ages 19-35, with only 21 percent of young adults retaining continuous nongroup coverage for two years. Given estimates from 2012 that 10.8 million people were covered in this market, these results suggest that 6.2 million people leave nongroup coverage annually. This suggests that the nongroup market was characterized by frequent disruptions in coverage before the ACA and that the effects of the recent cancellations are not necessarily out of the norm. These results can serve as a useful pre-ACA baseline with which to evaluate the law's long-term impact on the stability of nongroup coverage."

An MLR is the proportion of premium revenues spent on clinical benefits, and must be at least 80% in the individual and small-group markets. Although some insurers have issued rebates, it is unclear whether they also adjusted MLRs and their components in ways to move toward compliance. Objective: To investigate early responses of individual and small-group insurers' MLR-related outcomes to the Affordable Care Act provisions. Research Design: Descriptive and multivariate analyses using 2010-2011 data from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners and other sources. Measures: Outcomes include MLRs, MLR components (claims incurred, premiums earned, quality improvement expenses, and fraud detection/recovery expenses), and administrative expenses. Results: In 2010, only 44.3% of individual market insurers reported MLRs of at least the stipulated level; by 2011, this percentage was 63.2%. Among small-group insurers, 74.9% had 2010 MLRs at or above the stipulated level, with little change in 2011. Individual insurers with 2010 MLRs >10 percentage points below the minimum exhibited the largest increases in MLRs, with changes occurring through increases in claims and indirectly through decreases in administrative expenses. Conclusions: Early responses to MLR regulation seem more pronounced in the individual versus small-group market, with insurers using both direct and indirect strategies for compliance. Because insurers learned of final MLR regulations only in late 2010, early responses may be limited and skewed more toward greater use of rebates than other adjustments. © 2014 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins."

Nonetheless, HHS announced its policy by posting on the Internet a thirteen-page bulletin stating that it would allow each state to define essential benefits for itself. On both substance and procedure, the move was surprising. The state-by-state approach departed from the uniform, federal standard that theACAappears to anticipate and that informed observers expectedHHSto adopt. And announcing the policy through an Internet bulletin appeared to allow HHS to sidestep traditional administrative procedures, including notice and comment, immediate review in the courts, and White House oversight. This article explores two questions. First, is the state-by-state approach a lawful exercise of HHS's authority? Second, did HHS in fact evade the procedural obligations that are meant to shape the exercise of its discretion? © 2014 by Duke University Press."

Some of these individuals were obtaining health care in safety net health clinics, emergency departments, or urgent care centers; many were going without needed care and will be new to the health care system. In addition to these newly insured, the ranks of older Americans and persons in need of chronic disease management will be on the rise. The way in which health care is delivered will have to change in order for the health care workforce to meet the demand for their services without sacrificing quality or access. Nurse practitioners and registered nurses have the education and skills to provide health promotion, disease prevention, and chronic disease management services that will make up a sizable portion of the demand. Amending state practice acts so that the authority to practice matches the ability to practice and opening provider panels to advanced practice nurses will provide opportunities to establish or expand sustainable nurse-led primary care practices in health care shortage areas. Along with these changes, models of health care delivery that incorporate differentiated practice roles and shared interprofessional responsibility for providing care will maximize the capacity of the system to provide the health care that people need.Copyright © 2014 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins."

The tax credits will go toward covering premiums for health insurance offered through exchanges-marketplaces offering private health plans. ACA also establishes subsidies to reduce cost-sharing expenses. ACA requires exchanges to be established in every state by January 1, 2014, either by the state itself or by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS). Exchanges will not be insurers, but will provide eligible individuals and small businesses with access to private health insurance plans. Generally, the plans offered through the exchanges will provide comprehensive coverage and meet all ACA market reforms, as applicable. The new premium credits established under ACA will be advanceable and refundable, meaning taxpayers need not wait until the end of the tax year in order to benefit from the credit, and may claim the full credit amount even if they have little or no federal income tax liability. Although the premium credits will not be available until 2014, the examples provided in this chapter estimate premium credit amounts by income levels and age, if the credits were available in 2013. Under ACA, the amount received in premium credits is based on income tax returns. These amounts are reconciled in the next year and can result in overpayment of premium credits if income increases, which must be repaid to the federal government. ACA limited the amount of required repayments. Since the enactment of ACA, these limits have been amended twice, under P.L. 111-309 and P.L. 112-9. In addition to premium credits, ACA authorized new cost-sharing subsidies. Certain premium credit recipients will also be eligible for reductions in their annual cost-sharing limits. Moreover, certain low-income individuals will receive additional subsidies in the form of reduced cost-sharing requirements (e.g., lower copayments). © 2014 Nova Science Publishers, Inc."

The aggregate amount of the ACA fee, to be collected across all covered insurers, will be $8.0 billion in 2014, $11.3 billion in 2015 and 2016, $13.9 billion in 2017, and $14.3 billion in 2018. After 2018, the aggregate fee will be indexed to the overall rate of annual premium growth, as calculated by the Internal Revenue Service. The annual fee will be apportioned among health insurers, based on (1) their market share and (2) their dollar value of business. The fee applies to net health care premiums written, which are defined in regulations as gross premiums from insurance sales minus refunds to enrollees under the medical loss ratio provisions of the ACA, certain commissions, and premiums ceded to reinsurers. Ceded premiums are premiums that an insurer transfers to a reinsurer, as payment for protection against defined market risks. The ACA fee does not apply to the first $25 million of net premiums written by a covered insurer. The fee will be imposed on 50% of net premiums written above $25 million and up to $50 million, and 100% of net premiums in excess of $50 million. The regulations shield a higher level of net premiums from the fee for insurers that are exempt from federal taxes and are considered to be public charities, social welfare organizations, high-risk health insurance pools, or consumer- operated-and-oriented health plans (COOP). The ACA fee does not apply to entities that fully self-insure, government-run insurance programs, or non-profit insurers incorporated under state law that receive more than 80% of their gross revenues from government programs that target low-income, elderly, or disabled populations (such as the State Children's Health Insurance Plan [CHIP], Medicare, and Medicaid). Some insurance issuers have informed shareholders and state insurance regulators that they intend to pass on the cost of the fee to businesses and enrollees in the form of higher premiums. Private insurers that contract with government organizations to provide Medicare and Medicaid health benefits will be subject to the fee, which could have implications for enrollee premiums and government payments to those plans. It is difficult to estimate the precise impact of the fee on the insurance industry, government programs, and consumers for several reasons, including a lack of public data on net premiums written. In addition, insurers' ability to pass on the fee will vary depending on competition in local markets, and their individual financial strategies. © 2014 Nova Science Publishers, Inc."

Secretary of U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and Hobby Lobby Stores v. Sebelius, along with recent federal court decisions, has highlighted the ongoing controversy over the scope of the Affordable Care Act's (ACA's) contraceptive coverage requirement, which requires an employer to provide certain contraceptive coverage to its employees under its group health plan. Some employers have objected to the requirement, citing objections to the facilitation of the use of contraceptives in conflict with the religious tenets by which their businesses operate. An analogous issue has arisen in state courts in the context of same-sex weddings. Several private businesses that qualify as public accommodations have objected to state requirements that they provide services without discriminating based on sexual orientation despite the owners' religious objections to same-sex marriage. These issues have raised a novel legal question for the courts: What rights do secular businesses that operate for profit have to pursue legal claims to protect their religious exercise? Although a number of statutory exemptions exist to protect individuals and organizations' religious beliefs and objections (e.g., employment discrimination under Title VII, disability discrimination under the Americans with Disabilities Act, etc.), courts have applied those exemptions only to individuals and nonprofit, religious organizations. A number of legal challenges to the contraceptive coverage requirement have examined a range of questions related to the rights of these businesses. As a threshold question, courts have had to analyze whether the business itself is eligible for protection under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) and Free Exercise jurisprudence. The businesses have asserted that they qualify as ""persons"" under RFRA and, in the alternative, that they are entitled to pursue their claims on behalf of their owners under what is known as the ""pass-through"" theory of corporate rights. Courts have also considered whether the business owners may pursue independent legal claims asserting their objections, or if their individual rights are forfeited at the time of the company's incorporation. If a court determines that the business or its owners are eligible for free exercise protection, it may then consider the merits of the case, including whether the mandate constitutes a substantial burden on religious exercise; whether the government has a compelling interest to do so; and whether the government used the least restrictive means to achieve that interest. Five federal circuit courts have considered these questions in the context of the contraceptive coverage requirement, and have reached different conclusions on the range of questions raised. In a recent development, Justice Sonia Sotomayor granted a temporary injunction on December 31, 2013, to Little Sisters of the Poor Home for the Aged, a nonprofit entity that maintains that the signing and providing of a form that would exempt it from the contraceptive coverage requirement violates its religious beliefs. This report examines the constitutional and statutory protections related to free exercise of religion, including current Supreme Court interpretations, as well as judicial and legislative avoidance of defining the parameters of religious belief. It also discusses significant examples of existing religious exemptions in current law, including employment nondiscrimination, health care, and public accommodations law. Finally, it analyzes recent federal judicial decisions that have considered the religious freedom rights of commercial entities whose owners have religious objections to the contraceptive coverage requirement. Recent court decisions have highlighted the ongoing controversy over the scope of the Affordable Care Act's (ACA's) contraceptive coverage requirement1 and, more generally, whether religious freedom rights extend to commercial entities as well as nonprofits and individuals.2 Although illustrated by the contraceptive coverage requirement, the question of whether secular, for-profit entities qualify for religious freedom protections reaches farther than the ongoing debate over ACA. Congress has enacted a number of exemptions to accommodate religious objections to legislative requirements, but those exemptions generally have been limited to individuals and nonprofit organizations.3 That is, for-profit entities' right to exercise religion generally has not been recognized in existing law. Litigation of the contraceptive coverage requirement as well as cases involving commercial entities' objections to providing services for same-sex wedding ceremonies reflects heightened attention in courts to the question of accommodation for such objections.4 Several federal courts and some state decisions that have considered the issue have reached different conclusions, and the U.S. Supreme Court, by granting certiorari in Conestoga and Hobby Lobby Store, appears poised to provide guidance on this issue in the future.5 This report examines the constitutional and statutory protections related to free exercise of religion, including current Supreme Court interpretations, as well as judicial and legislative avoidance of defining the parameters of religious belief.

The authority and responsibilities of an exchange may vary, depending on statutory or other requirements for its establishment and structure. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA, P.L. 111-148, as amended) requires health insurance exchanges to be established in every state by January 1, 2014. ACA provides certain requirements for the establishment of exchanges, while leaving other choices to be made by the states. Qualified individuals and small businesses will be able to purchase private health insurance through exchanges. Issuers selling health insurance plans through an exchange will have to follow certain rules, such as meeting the private market reform requirements in ACA. While the fundamental purpose of the exchanges will be to facilitate the offer and purchase of health insurance, nothing in the ACA prohibits qualified individuals, qualifiedemployers, and insurance carriers from participating in the health insurance market outside of exchanges. Moreover, ACA explicitly states that enrollment in exchanges is voluntary and no individual may be compelled to enroll in exchange coverage. Exchanges may be established either by the state itself as a state-based exchange or by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) as a federally-facilitated exchange. A federally-facilitated exchange may be operated solely by the federal government, or it may be operated by the federal government in conjunction with the state, as a partnership exchange. All exchanges are required to carry out many of the same functions and adhere to many of the same standards, although there are important differences between the types of exchanges. ACA and regulations require exchanges to carry out a number of different functions. The primary functions relate to determining eligibility and enrolling individuals in appropriate plans, plan management, consumer assistance and accountability, and financial management. ACA gives various federal agencies, primarily HHS, responsibilities relating to the general operation of exchanges. Federal agencies are generally responsible for promulgating regulations, creating criteria and systems, and awarding grants to states to help them create and implement exchanges. A state that is approved to operate its own exchange has a number of operational decisions to make, including decisions related to organizational structure (governmental agency or a nonprofit entity) types of exchanges (separate individual and Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP) exchanges, or a merged exchange) collaboration (a state may independently operate an exchange or enter into contracts with other states) service area (a state may establish one or more subsidiary exchanges in the state if each exchange serves a geographically distinct area and meets certain size requirements) contracted services (an exchange may contract with certain entities to carry out one or more responsibilities of the exchange) and governance (governing board and standards of conduct). In general, health plans offered through exchanges will provide comprehensive coverage and meet all applicable private market reforms specified in ACA. Most exchange plans will provide coverage for essential health benefits, at minimum be subject to certain limits on cost-sharing, including out-of-pocket costs; and meet one of four levels of plan generosity based on actuarial value. To make exchange coverage more affordable, certain individuals will receive premium assistance in the form of federal tax credits.Moreover, some recipients of premium credits may also receive subsidies toward cost-sharing expenses. This report outlines the required minimum functions of exchanges, and explains how exchanges are expected to be established and administered under ACA. The coverage offered through exchanges is discussed, and the report concludes with a discussion of how exchanges will interact with selected other ACA provisions. © 2014 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Assessments of the adequacy of physician supply often focus on three dimensions of the physician population: its size; its composition (e.g., the mix between primary care and specialty physicians); and its geographic distribution. Policies that aim to alter physician supply generally focus on both current and future supply along these three dimensions because physician training is a lengthy process; therefore, changes implemented to alter supply do not have immediate effects. Each of the three dimensions of physician supply is important for health care spending and for population health because physician clinical decisions affect approximately 90% of each health care dollar spent. In addition, as physicians provide health care services that, with some exceptions, cannot be provided by non-physicians, the size, composition, and geographic distribution of the physician population affects the amount and type of health care services available. A number of studies have found physician shortages overall, in certain specialties, and in certain geographic areas. The federal government pays for physician services, primarily through the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and supports physician training through a number of programs in various departments and agencies. Given current investments in physician services and the physician workforce, the adequacy of the current and future physician supply may be of interest to Congress. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA, P.L. 111-148, as amended) may affect the demand for physician services, a major determinant of physician supply, because it expands insurance coverage to some of those previously uninsured. The ACA also includes provisions that may affect the size, composition, and geographic distribution of the physician population by supporting changes to physician training, compensation, and practice. Specifically, provisions targeting the number of physicians trained and their productivity may affect the size of the physician population. The composition of the physician population may be altered by provisions targeting the supply of primary care providers or specialties in shortage. Provisions addressing the diversity of the physician workforce and those incentivizing practice in rural or other underserved areas may affect the geographic distribution of the physician population. Finally, the ACA includes provisions that provide for data collection and evaluation of the adequacy of the workforce in general, and federal workforce programs specifically. Whether and how these provisions will affect physician supply is not yet known because some of these provisions have not been implemented yet, are temporary, will not have immediate effects, or rely on discretionary funding. This chapter examines each dimension of physician supply, separately discussing current (and, where appropriate, future) concerns and relevant changes included in the ACA that may affect each dimension. The chapter then discusses workforce planning activities included in the ACA that may affect all three dimensions of supply. © 2014 Nova Science Publishers, Inc."

At its most basic, an MLR measures the share of a health care premium dollar spent on medical benefits, as opposed to company expenses such as overhead or profits. For example, if total premiums collected are $100,000, and $85,000 is spent on medical care, the MLR would be 85%. The ACA sets the minimum required MLR at 80% for the individual and small group markets and at 85% for the large group market. In general, the higher the MLR, the more value a policyholder receives for his or her premium payment. Congress imposed the MLR in an effort to provide ""greater transparency and accountability around the expenditures made by health insurers and to help bring down the cost of health care."" Insurers that fail to meet these minimum standards must provide rebates to policyholders. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), with input from state insurance commissioners who are the main regulators of health insurance, issued rules for implementing the MLR. These rules provided greater details for calculating the MLR and issuing rebate payments. ACA allows companies to include quality improvements along with medical benefits when calculating the MLR. In addition, state and local taxes and some licensing fees are subtracted (i.e., disregarded) from expenses in the MLR formula. ACA's requirements are different from those imposed by state laws, which generally compare only medical claims to premiums. Though a number of states have their own MLRs, the ACA is now the minimum standard that must be met nationwide by certain health insurers. About 8.6 million U.S. consumers were due more than $500 million in ACA MLR rebate payments by August 2013, for an average award of $98 per qualifying household. Employers or insurers can provide the rebates, which are based on activity in 2012, via a check, an electronic deposit in a bank account, a reduction in insurance premiums, or by spending the funds for the benefit of employees. The MLR is based on the aggregate performance of a health plan, not on individual policy history. Even if a beneficiary had no medical claims during a given year, he or she would not receive a rebate if the broader plan met the MLR requirements. In addition, many Americans were enrolled in health plans that were not covered by the ACA MLR provisions in 2012. The ACA MLR provisions cover only fully funded health plans, which are plans where insurance companies assume the full risk for medical expenses incurred. The requirements do not extend to self-funded plans, which are health care plans offered by businesses in which the employer assumes the risk for, and pays for, medical care. Non-profit insurers and some Medicare Advantage plans were not covered by the ACA MLR standards during the first two years the law was in effect, though these insurers will be subject to MLR provisions in 2014. In addition, some states won special exceptions for individual insurance policies, based on an HHS determination that meeting the MLR requirement would harm a state's insurance market. Several issues have been raised about the MLR provisions since the ACA was enacted. These include considerations regarding the treatment of insurance agent and broker bonuses and commissions, and the impact of the MLR on insurers that provide high deductible plans. © 2014 Nova Science Publishers, Inc."

The provisions that most directly relate to small businesses are (1) an employer penalty for not providing health insurance, (2) a tax credit to increase the affordability of health care for the smallest firms, and (3) small business health insurance exchanges designed to increase plan options and lower plan costs. Several events have altered ACA's implementation since its enactment in 2010. Most notably, the Obama Administration delayed the implementation of the employer penalty and part of the small business health exchanges from 2014 to 2015 to allow for more time for developing these provisions and allowing firms to come into compliance. Subsequently, the Administration suspended the penalty for employers with fewer than 100 full-time equivalents (FTEs) for an additional year (2016). These delays have added to uncertainty over the potential effects of ACA on small businesses.First, this report explains how employer-sponsored insurance can be used to address concerns about health insurance coverage and cost. Second, it summarizes the three ACA provisions most relevant to small businesses, listed above. Next, it analyzes these provisions for their potential effects on small businesses. Last, this report presents several approaches that could address some concerns associated with these provisions (particularly the employer penalty). According to analysis of the most recent employer size and insurance coverage data, ACA's employer penalty is structured so that it could exempt approximately 96.2% of employer firms simply because they would be too small, and thus fall below the employer penalty threshold of 50 FTE employees. These exempt firms account for approximately 27.6% of all workers. After accounting for firms that already provide insurance, less than 1% of employer firms could be subject to the employer penalty. Although 72.4% of all employees work for firms that are large enough to be potentially subject to the penalty, only about 1.8% of employees work in firms that do not already offer health insurance. Less than 4% of small businesses that could have been eligible for the small business health care tax credit in 2010 actually claimed it. According to a report by the Government Accountability Office (GAO), many business owners felt that (1) the credit was too small of an incentive to begin offering insurance; (2) even if these small employers offered health insurance, some employees declined coverage because they could not afford their share of the premium; and (3) the rules were too complex. President Obama has proposed simplifying and expanding the credit. Small business health exchanges could help to reduce some barriers to accessing relatively affordable health coverage in the small-group market. By pooling risk among multiple businesses and reducing administrative costs, average insurance costs could reduce costs for these firms. On the other hand, firms with relatively healthier employees could see a rise in insurance costs. One issue of concern is the incentive for firms to reduce part-time employee hours below the 30 that define full-time employment (under ACA) as a means to exclude these employees from coverage. Several bills have been introduced (e.g., H.R. 2575) to increase the definition of full-time to at least 40 hours per week. Although this change would reduce the incentive at 30 hours per week, it would introduce an incentive to reduce hours among those that work around 40 hours (a larger share of all workers). © 2014 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

H.R. 2667 would delay by one year the applicable effective date for the employer requirements, employer penalties, and related reporting requirements specified under ACA.The White House blog posting is available at http://www.white house.gov/blog/2013/07/02/we-relistening-businesses-about-health-carelaw. The ACA increases access to health insurance coverage, expands federal private health insurance market requirements, and requires the creation of health insurance exchanges to provide individuals and small employers with access to insurance. To ensure that employers continue to provide some degree of coverage, the ACA includes a shared responsibility provision. This provision does not explicitly mandate that an employer offer employees health insurance; however, the ACA imposes penalties on large employers if at least one of their full-time employees obtains a premium credit through the newly established exchange. According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), employers are projected to pay $ 130 billion in penalty payments over a 10-year period. The ACA sets out a two-part calculation for determining, first, which firms are subject to the penalty (e.g., definition of large), and, second, to which workers within a firm the penalty is applied. Because the treatment of part-time and seasonal workers differs across these two parts of the calculation, this has led to some confusion among policymakers and employers. For example, part-time employees are included in what is termed a full-time equivalent calculation to determine if an employer has at least 50 full-time equivalent employees (FTEs) and is thus considered large for purposes of applying the penalty. However, the actual penalty, if applicable, is levied only on full-time workers (those working at least 30 hours a week on average). This report discusses these definitions and the application to the employer penalty in greater detail. The potential employer penalty applies to all common law employers, including an employer that is a government entity (such as federal, state, local, or Indian Tribal government entities) and an employer that is a nonprofit organization that is exempt from federal income taxes. If a franchise is owned by one individual or entity, employees in each of the franchises must be aggregated to determine the number of both full-time equivalent and full-time employees. The actual amount of the penalty varies depending on whether an employer currently offers insurance coverage or not. In order for employers who do provide health insurance coverage to avoid paying a penalty, health insurance coverage that is both affordable and adequate must be offered to the employee. Coverage is considered affordable if the employee's required contribution to the plan does not exceed 9.5% of the employee's household income for the taxable year. However, IRS has provided a safe harbor for employers to use the employee's W-2 income for this calculation (since most employers do not readily have information on an employee's household income). A health plan is considered to provide adequate coverage if the plan's actuarial value (i.e., the share ofthe total allowed costs that the plan is expected to cover) is at least 60%. This report provides greater detail on these requirements. The total penalty for any applicable large employer is based on its number of full-time employees. The ACA specified that working 30 hours or more a week is considered full-time. However, the statute did not specify what time period (i.e., monthly or annually) employers would use to determine if a worker is full-time. To address this issue, the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Secretary of Labor have published proposed regulations to provide guidance for employers to use to determine which employees are considered full-time employees for purposes of administering the ACA employer penalty provision. The proposed regulations provide employers some flexibility to designate certain measurement or look-back periods (up to 12 months) during which they will calculate whether a worker is full-time or not. Once an employee is determined to be full-time, there will then be an administrative period to enroll employees in a health plan, if necessary. If an employer penalty is levied under the ACA requirements, it applies only for the time period following the administrative period, which is called the stability period. Employers are not penalized if an employee enters the exchange and receives a premium credit during the measurement period. In addition, because of this latest guidance, it is unlikely that employers will pay a penalty for seasonal workers who do not work at least 30 hours, on average over a pre-specified time period (up to 12-months). This report describes these proposed regulations in greater detail and provides examples of potential dates when employers will need to begin measuring full-time status for their on-going employees. © 2014 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

We examine this puzzle in the context of Democratic legislators' representation of their senior citizen constituents on the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA). We find that legislators' roll-call votes on the ACA did not reflect the stated preferences of their respective senior constituents; by contrast, these roll-call votes did reflect the preferences of nonsenior adults. We draw upon a theoretical framework developed by Mansbridge to explain this apparent nonresponsiveness to seniors on the ACA. This framework distinguishes between promissory representation, whereby legislators merely respond to constituents' preferences, and anticipatory representation, whereby legislators respond to constituents'underlying policy interests, even when such interests conflict with expressed preferences. By considering the Medicare provisions in the ACA and analyzing Democratic legislators' floor speeches on health reform, we provide preliminary evidence that members of Congress engaged in anticipatory representation of their senior constituents by attempting to educate seniors about how the ACA serves their policy interests. © 2014 by Duke University Press."

Institutions may receive Title VII support for such activities as residency programs at medical and dental schools, recruitment and retention initiatives in community-based educational settings, and health workforce data collection and analysis within state health departments. Individuals typically receive direct assistance through scholarships, loans, loan repayments, or fellowships. Title VII authorizes several advisory groups to make recommendations to the Secretary of Health and Human Services and Congress on various health workforce programs and Title VII functions. The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), oversees programs authorized in Title VII. The health care workforce-the backbone of the health care delivery system-includes physicians, nurses, dentists, therapists, and others whodeliver health services to individuals in physicians' offices, health centers, clinics, and other community-based health care settings. In 2010, Congress reauthorized Title VII health workforce programs and activities in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA, P.L. 111-148, as amended). The ACA also added several new authorities that aim to build and sustain the health care workforce alongside other provisions for health reform, including health insurance expansion. The 113th Congress has held hearings and introduced legislation to address the adequacy of the health care workforce. Health policy experts anticipate that ACA provisions for health insurance expansion could lead to an increased demand for health service utilization, and they expect that this increased demand for services could prompt increased demand for health providers, including physicians and nurses. Other factors causing concern about the adequacy of the health workforce include uneven provider distribution, attrition and retirement, and demands of the aging population.

This tax, which took effect in January 2013, is projected to collect approximately $38 billion of excise tax revenues over the next 10 years, resulting in $29 billion of net revenues, after accounting for offsets from other taxes. Some have called for a repeal of the medical device tax since enactment in 2010. Repeal of the tax has become such a high priority for some Members of Congress that it was one of the provisions discussed in the October 2013 negotiations over ending the federal government shutdown and increases in the federal debt ceiling. Repeal, delay, or reform of the tax could be included in future negotiations over the federal budget, debt ceiling, or tax reform. The major justification offered for the medical device tax is its revenue, which helps offset the cost of the ACA. Although the tax is relatively small, no revenue replacement has been proposed and it may be difficult to find. There is also a concern among some that eliminating the medical device tax would lead to proposals to eliminate similar fees and taxes on other industries, the sum of which, including the device tax, totals $165 billion over 10 years. The tax was justified partly because the medical device industry was among the commercial interests that stood to benefit from unanticipated profits as more individuals enroll in health care insurance, post-ACA. Viewed from the perspective of traditional economic and tax theory, however, the tax is challenging to justify. In general, tax policy is more efficient when differential excise taxes are not imposed. It is generally more efficient to raise revenue from a broad tax base. Therefore excise taxes are usually based on specific objectives such as discouraging undesirable activities (e.g., tobacco taxes) or funding closely related government spending (e.g., gasoline taxes to finance highway construction). These justifications do not apply, other than weakly, to the medical device case. The tax also imposes administrative and compliance costs that may be disproportionate to revenue. Opponents of the tax claim that the medical device tax could have significant, negative consequences for the U.S. medical device industry and on jobs. The estimates in this report suggest fairly minor effects, with output and employment in the industry falling by no more than two-tenths of 1%. This limited effect is due to the small tax rate, the exemption of approximately half of output, and the relatively insensitive demand for health services. The analysis suggests that most of the tax will fall on consumer prices, and not on profits of medical device companies. The effect on the price of health care, however, will most likely be negligible because of the small size of the tax and small share of health care spending attributable to medical devices. © 2014 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

To ensure that employers continue to provide some degree of coverage, ACA includes a shared responsibility provision. This provision does not explicitly mandate that an employer offer employees health insurance; instead, ACA imposes penalties on large employers if at least one of their fulltime employees obtains a premium credit through the newly established exchange. A companion provision to the employer requirements is the ACA requirement for most individuals to maintain health insurance coverage (individual mandate) or pay a penalty, with exceptions. These provisions are effective in 2014 according to the ACA statute.ACA requires the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to coordinate various information reporting requirements. Specifically, this information will be used for determining whether employer coverage exists and, if it does, whether it is adequate and affordable for purposes of the employer shared responsibility payments and individuals have an offer of minimum essential coverage for purposes of the individual mandate, as well as eligibility for premium credits in the newly established exchanges. On July 2, 2013, the Obama Administration announced that it is going to delay, until 2015, enforcement and associated reporting requirements relating to potential employer penalties under ACA. On July 11, 2013, the IRS released Notice 2013-45, which provided more detailed information on this transitional relief. According to the IRS notice, this transition relief will provide additional time for input from employers and other reporting entities in an effort to simplify information reporting consistent with effective implementation of the law. This delay may have implications for an individual's health insurance coverage and eligibility for tax assistance provided through the exchanges. One potential impact of a delay in the enforcement of potential employer penalties may be a lower than projected number of large employers offering health insurance coverage. This may result in a larger than projected increase in the number of workers eligible for premium tax credits in the exchanges in 2014 and an increase in the number of uninsured. However, while measurement of the magnitude of this effect is beyond the scope of this report, one recent study found that a delay may not have a significant effect on the employer-sponsored health insurance coverage. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) have not yet completed an analysis of the impact that the Administration's announcement and other recently issued final rules will have on spending and revenues under current law. On July 11, 2013, the House of Representatives introduced H.R. 2667: Authority for Mandate Delay Act, which would delay for one year certain reporting requirements as well as penalties for certain large employers. CBO and JCT's cost estimate of H.R. 2667 on July 16 reported that enacting H.R. 2667 would not affect direct spending or revenues because the bill essentially codifies the Administration's recent announcement. Therefore, according to CBO, pay-as-you-go procedures do not apply. On July 17, 2013, the House passed H.R. 2667. © 2014 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved."

The new regulations were issued less than a month before the 2.3% excise tax took effect on January 1, 2013. This report provides a brief overview of the recently enacted Treasury regulations, analyzes the legal implications of the regulations, and answers frequently asked questions about the medical device tax. The Treasury regulations on the medical device excise tax explain both who is subject to the excise tax and the scope of the statutory exemptions provided for the tax. Specifically, the regulations incorporate by reference the general definitions for a manufacturer, producer, or importer outlined in the Internal Revenue Code, meaning that the excise tax will be directly paid by manufacturers, as opposed to consumers or others that use a given medical device. Furthermore, the regulations attempt to clarify the limits to the medical device excise tax. Beyond the statutory exemptions created for eyeglasses, contact lenses, and hearing aids, the law created a retail exemption to the excise tax, excluding from the tax medical devices that are generally purchased by the general public at retail for individual use. The Treasury regulations attempt to simultaneously provide certainty to potential taxpayers as to which devices are subject to the retail exemption, while allowing the government the flexibility to properly apply the retail exemption to the variety of devices that could be exposed to the excise tax. The regulations provide a flexible two-prong test to determine whether a device should fall within the retail exemption, applying the exemption when the device is (1) regularly available for purchase by non-professional consumers and (2) not primarily intended for use by medical professionals. The regulations provide several factors to consider when applying the two-prong test. To provide some certainty to the scope of the retail exemption, the regulations also included several safe harbor provisions, explicitly acknowledging that certain devices, such as over-the-counter devices, fall within the retail exemption. The new Treasury regulations on the medical device excise tax, while providing some certainty with respect to what devices will be exempt from the tax, generally favor a more flexible approach to defining the scope of the central exemption to the tax. As a consequence, uncertainty remains as to which medical devices will be subject to the tax. Indeed, Treasury, in releasing the medical device excise tax regulations, notes that further clarification on various issues implicated by the tax is still needed. As such, the regulations constitute only the first step in defining the limits of the medical device excise tax. © 2014 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved."

However, time constraints may limit physicians' ability to provide all recommended preventive services, especially with increasing demand from the Affordable Care Act in the United States. Team-based practice that includes advanced practice registered nurses and physician assistants (APRN/PA) may help meet this demand. This study investigates the relationship between an APRN/PA visit and receipt of guideline-consistent cancer screening and prevention recommendations.Methods: Data from the 2010 National Health Interview Survey were analyzed with multivariate logistic regression to assess provider type seen and receipt of guideline-consistent cancer screening and prevention recommendations (n = 26,716).Results: In adjusted analyses, women who saw a primary care physician (PCP) and an APRN/PA or a PCP without an APRN/PA in the past 12 months were more likely to be compliant with cervical and breast cancer screening guidelines than women who did not see a PCP or APRN/PA (all p < 0.0001 for provider type). Women and men who saw a PCP and an APRN/PA or a PCP without an APRN/PA were also more likely to receive guideline consistent colorectal cancer screening and advice to quit smoking and participate in physical activity than women and men who did not see a PCP or APRN/PA (all p < 0.01 for provider type).Conclusions: Seeing a PCP alone, or in conjunction with an APRN/PA is associated with patient receipt of guideline-consistent cancer prevention and screening recommendations. Integrating APRN/PA into primary care may assist with the delivery of cancer prevention and screening services. More intervention research efforts are needed to explore how APRN/PA will be best able to increase cancer screening, HPV vaccination, and receipt of behavioral counseling, especially during this era of healthcare reform. © 2014 Kepka et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd."

The Affordable Care Act and parity laws are expected to result in increased access to treatment through integration of substance use disorder (SUD) services with primary care. However, relatively little research exists on the integration of SUD services into primary care settings. Our goal was to assess SUD service integration in California primary care settings and to identify the practice and policy facilitators and barriers encountered by providers who have attempted to integrate these services.Methods: Primary survey and qualitative interview data were collected from the population of federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) in five California counties known to be engaged in SUD integration efforts was surveyed. From among the organizations that responded to the survey (78% response rate), four were purposively sampled based on their level of integration. Interviews were conducted with management, staff, and patients (n = 18) from these organizations to collect further qualitative information on the barriers and facilitators of integration.Results: Compared to mental health services, there was a trend for SUD services to be less integrated with primary care, and SUD services were rated significantly less effective. The perceived difference in effectiveness appeared to be due to provider training. Policy suggestions included expanding the SUD workforce that can bill Medicaid, allowing same-day billing of two services, facilitating easier reimbursement for medications, developing the workforce, and increasing community SUD specialty care capacity.Conclusions: Efforts to integrate SUD services with primary care face significant barriers, many of which arise at the policy level and are addressable. © 2014 Urada et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd."

Since 90 % of state Medicaid programs cover bariatric surgery, the outcomes of Medicaid patients will be important to study. We performed a retrospective analysis to compare outcomes between Medicaid and non-Medicaid bariatric surgery patients over a two-year period. Methods All patients who underwent a laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass at The Ohio State University Medical Center from January 2008-April 2011 were identified. Of these 609 patients, 30 Medicaid patients were identified and compared to 90 randomly selected non-Medicaid patients (1:3 case-control). Preoperative data and postoperative outcome data (weight loss, comorbidity resolution, complications, and mortality) were obtained from electronic medical records. Descriptive statistical analyses were performed to compare categorical and continuous variables. Results Medicaid patients had a significantly higher average BMI (58.4 vs. 49.5; p < 0.001) and higher rates of comorbidities. Over a 90-day postoperative period, Medicaid patients experienced a higher wound complication rate (20.0 vs. 5.6 %; p = 0.03) and visited the ER more frequently (33.3 vs. 10.0 %; p = 0.007) but had similar rates of medical complications compared to non-Medicaid patients. The Medicaid cohort lost 52.1 % of its excess body weight vs. 64.6 % for the non-Medicaid cohort (p = 0.02) over a two-year period. There were no significant differences in comorbidity resolution, anastomotic complications, or mortality after 2 years of follow-up.

Methods. California registry data were analyzed for 459 AAs and 3,001 NHWAs diagnosed with stage II to IV colon cancer between 1996 and 2000 and followed until 2011. Socioeconomic data from the 2000 census categorized neighborhoods: extremely poor (≥ 30% of households poor), middle (5-29% poor) and low poverty (< 5% poor). Participants were randomly selected from these poverty strata. Primary health insurers were Medicaid, Medicare, private or none. Chemotherapy rates were age and stage-adjusted and comparisons used standardized rate ratios (RR). Logistic and Cox regressions, respectively, modeled chemotherapy receipt and long term survival. Results: A significant 3-way ethnicity by poverty by health insurance interaction effect on chemotherapy receipt was observed. Among those who did not live in extremely poor neighborhoods and were adequately insured privately or by Medicare, chemotherapy rates did not differ significantly between AAs (37.7%) and NHWAs (39.5%). Among those who lived in extremely poor neighborhoods and were inadequately insured by Medicaid or uninsured, AAs (14.6%) were nearly 60% less likely to receive chemotherapy than were NHWAs (25.5%, RR = 0.41). When the 3-way interaction effect as well as the main effects of poverty, health insurance and chemotherapy was accounted for, survival rates of AAs and NHWAs were the same. Conclusions: The multiplicative barrier to colon cancer care that results from being extremely poor and inadequately insured is worse for AAs than it is for NHWAs. AAs are more prevalently poor, inadequately insured, and have fewer assets so they are probably less able to absorb the indirect and direct, but uncovered, costs of colon cancer care. Policy makers ought to be cognizant of these factors as they implement the Affordable Care Act and consider future health care reforms. © 2014 Gorey et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd."

In comparisons of the pre- and postcoverage periods, mean annual encounters among persons who gained insurance increased 22% to 35%, but declined in the comparison groups.

For many people living with HIV, this has required transition either from the HIV-specific coverage of the Ryan White program to the more comprehensive coverage provided by the county-run Low-Income Health Programs or from Medicaid fee-for-service to Medicaid managed care. Patient advocates have expressed concern that these transitions may present implementation challenges that will need to be addressed if ambitious HIV prevention and treatment goals are to be achieved. Methods: 30 semi-structured, in-depth interviews were conducted between October, 2012, and February, 2013, with policymakers and providers in 10 urban, suburban, and rural California counties. Interview topics included: continuity of patient care, capacity to handle payer source transitions, and preparations for healthcare reform implementation. Study team members reviewed interview transcripts to produce emergent themes, develop a codebook, build inter-rater reliability, and conduct analyses. Results: Respondents supported the goals of the ACA, but reported clinic and policy-level challenges to maintaining patient continuity of care during the payer source transitions. They also identified strategies for addressing these challenges. Areas of focus included: gaps in communication to reach patients and develop partnerships between providers and policymakers, perceived inadequacy in new provider networks for delivering quality HIV care, the potential for clinics to become financially insolvent due to lower reimbursement rates, and increased administrative burdens for clinic staff and patients. Conclusions: California's new healthcare initiatives represent ambitious attempts to expand and improve health coverage for low-income individuals. The state's challenges in maintaining quality care and treatment for people living with HIV experiencing these transitions demonstrate the importance of setting effective policies in anticipation of full ACA implementation in 2014. © 2014 Hazelton et al."

Prior research suggests that the odds of having private coverage and being uninsured increase with increases in public insurance premiums. The aim of this paper is to test effects of Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) premium increases on public insurance, private insurance, and uninsurance rates. Methods: The fact that families just below and above a state-specific income cut-off are likely very similar in terms of observable and unobservable characteristics except the premium contribution provides a natural experiment for estimating the effect of premium increases. Using 2003 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) merged with CHIP premiums, we compare health insurance outcomes for CHIP eligible children as of January 2003 in states with a two-tier premium structure using a cross-sectional regression discontinuity methodology. We use difference-in-differences analysis to compare longitudinal insurance outcomes by December 2003. Results: Higher CHIP premiums are associated with higher likelihood of private insurance. Disenrollment from CHIP in response to premium increases over time does not increase the uninsurance rate. Conclusions: When faced with higher CHIP premiums, private health insurance may be a preferable alternative for CHIP eligible families with higher incomes.

In addition, nurses at the bedside have significantly lower engagement scores than nurses who are not involved in direct patient care. Considering the relationship between nurse engagement and patient experience and the relationship between patient experience and hospital success under VBP, pursuing strategies and tactics that will foster and sustain nurse engagement is critical for nurse executives. © 2014 Wolters Kluwer Health I Lippincott Williams & Wilkins."

In this article we explore the need to break down the current policy silos between health care and criminal justice, to benefit both sectors and reduce unnecessary costs resulting from lack of coordination. To draw attention to the hidden costs of the current system, we review three case studies, from Washington State, Los Angeles County in California, and New York City. Each case study addresses different aspects of care needed by or provided to the jail-involved population, including mental health and substance abuse, emergency care, and coordination of care transitions.

Objective: To increase primary care usage by understanding the beliefs about primary and emergency care most salient to those whose healthcare-seeking practices may be impacted by the ACA. Methods: Community forum and focus group discussions were held with residents of a low-income community who are affected by health disparities, are heavily reliant on emergency care for their medical needs, and whose primary healthcare options should expand under the provisions of the ACA. Results: Explored within a theory of planned behaviour framework, results suggest residents' attitudes toward primary and emergency care are predicated on beliefs about costs, wait times, and the ability to access care locally. Conclusion: In light of findings about the determinants that drive healthcare-seeking intentions and ultimately behaviours, we recommend educational strategies that health promoters can adopt to encourage populations that are newly insured and traditionally reliant on emergency services to pursue routine primary care. © 2013 The Author(s)."

Because a large portion of this population are young men-a demographic previously underrepresented in Medicaid rolls-who have been uninsured, Medicaid payers and the managed care plans they contract with have little experience serving this population. To meet the Affordable Care Act's policy objectives of cost-efficient and effective care through improved and expanded access, health plans need to understand the epidemiology and care-seeking patterns of this population. Plans also need to develop outreach, communications, and engagement strategies and create service models designed to address these individuals' health care needs. Corrections departments and health plans should exchange information about the medical histories of people entering and leaving prisons and jails, promote models of peer support, and advocate for suspension rather than termination of Medicaid benefits during incarceration, so inmates can quickly regain coverage once they are released. © 2014 Project HOPE-The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc."

It was enacted to expand health insurance access, improve funding for health professions education, and reform patient care delivery. The traditional fee-for-service payment system has been criticized for overspending and providing substandard quality of care. The Accountable Care Organization (ACO) was developed as a payment reform mechanism to slow rising health care costs and improve quality. Under this concept, networks of clinicians and hospitals share responsibility for a population of patients and are held accountable for the financial and clinical outcomes. Due to high rates of medication misuse, nonadherence to therapeutic medication regimens, and preventable adverse drug events, pharmacists are in an ideal position to manage drug therapy and reduce health care expenditures; as such, they may be valuable assets to the ACO team. This article discusses the role of the pharmacist in the era of ACOs specifically and health care reform globally. It outlines pharmacy-related quality of care measures, medication therapy management (MTM) programs (which may provide the foundation for pharmacist involvement in ACOs), and pharmacist functions in patient-centered medical homes (through which ACO services may be organized).

Because these people have tended to also be uninsured, jail frequently has been their only regular source of health care. Three thousand three hundred local and county jails processed 11.6 million admissions during the twelve-month period ending midyear 2012. The Urban Institute estimated as much as 30 percent of some local corrections budgets is allocated to inmate health care services. This investment is largely lost when people are released back into the community, where they typically do not get treatment. For people with untreated substance use or mental illness, this issue reaches beyond public health, because without treatment, these people are at heightened risk of cycling into and out of jail for low-level, nonviolent offenses.

As we embark on this transformation, disparities have emerged as the hallmark of low-value healthcare--care that does not meet quality standards, is inefficient, and is usually of high cost. A new set of structures is being developed to facilitate increased access to care that is cost-effective and high in quality--otherwise known as high-value healthcare. Addressing disparities and achieving equity are the perfect target areas for recouping value, and doing so will pave the way for high-value healthcare. As healthcare leaders make difficult choices, they should consider the realities of healthcare equity. First, racial and ethnic disparities in healthcare persist and are a clear sign of poor-quality, low-value healthcare. Second, the root causes of these disparities are complex, but a well-developed set of evidence-based approaches is available to help leaders address healthcare inequity. Third, evidence suggests that being inattentive to the root causes of disparities adversely affects efficiency and an organization's bottom line. Finally, if healthcare organizations are progressive, thoughtful, and prepared for success in such an environment, a new healthcare system that offers accessible, high-value, equitable, culturally competent, and high-quality care to all is well within reach."

The subtext of the dream is the assumption of equal opportunity for education and the subsequent career opportunities that presumably follow. Assuming equality of opportunity (a large assumption indeed), potential success is based on individual talent and effort resulting in part in the development of the individualistic societal norms of the 'self-made man,' 'every man for himself,' and 'rugged individualism' ideologies that are predominant in the US today. The archetype of the American Dream is the self-made man who, through will and determination gains an education, career success, and material wealth exemplified by home ownership. Human rights language would refer to these as the right to education, work, property, and housing. US constitutional law strongly protects civil and political rights. US federal law has even come to protect some economic, social, and cultural rights such as education as part and parcel of the American Dream. Until the 2010 passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), the right to health has for the most part been excluded from both the notion of the American Dream as well as protection under US federal law. This chapter provides an overview of the historical development of the American Dream, an examination of global health models, and the U.S. model more specifically. It also explores the ACA and the 2012 US Supreme Court ruling as it relates to the international conceptualization of the human right to health, specifically focusing on the human rights principles of accessibility and nondiscrimination and how the ACA may contribute to an expanded notion of the American Dream including the right to health. © T.M.C.

Methods The research team contacted 100 randomly chosen orthopedic surgery practices in North Carolina by phone on 2 different occasions separated by 3 weeks. The research team attempted to obtain an appointment for a fictitious 28-year-old man with an acute flexor tendon laceration. Insurance status was presented as Medicaid in 1 call and private insurance in the other call. Ability of an office to schedule an appointment was recorded. Results Of the 100 practices, 13 were excluded because they did not perform hand surgery, which left 87 practices. The patient in the scenario with Medicaid was offered an appointment significantly less often (67%) than the patient in the scenario with private insurance (82%). The odds of the patient with private insurance obtaining an appointment were 2.2 times greater than the odds of the Medicaid patient obtaining an appointment. The Medicaid patient was more likely not to be offered an appointment owing to the lack of a hand surgeon at a practice (28% of appointment denials) than privately insured patients (13% of appointment denials). Conclusions For patients with acute flexor tendon lacerations, insurance status has an important role in the ability to obtain an orthopedic clinic appointment. We found that patients with Medicaid have more barriers to accessing care for a flexor tendon laceration than patients with private insurance.

Certain cancer screening tests reduce cancer mortality. Methods: The 2010 National Health Interview Survey was used to examine associations between adherence to breast, cervical, and colon cancer screening recommendations and alternative shift work among female workers. Results: Workers on alternative shifts, compared to workers on daytime shifts, were more likely to be non-adherent to screening recommendations for breast (34% vs. 23%) and colorectal (55% vs. 48%) cancer (P<0.05). Workers on alternative shifts in two industries (""Manufacturing"" and ""Accommodation/Food Services"") and three occupations (""Food Preparation/Serving,"" ""Personal Care Services,"" and ""Production"") were more likely to be non-adherent to screening recommendations for at least two cancers (P<0.05).

Kennedy's message to the US Congress on the need to reform mental healthcare. Much has changed in that time. In 2006, Frank and Glied summarized these changes and the forces behind them, finding that the well-being of people with mental illness was 'better but not well.' They also conclude that most improvements have been due to 'mainstreaming,' the inclusion of those with mental illness in broad reforms such as Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. With the gradual assimilation of mental health concerns, leadership and resources into mainstream programmes and agencies, future improvements will require that these programmes are accessible and oriented to people with mental illness. The passage of broad health reform legislation in 2010 (the Affordable Care Act) reinforces this change; several of its provisions attempt to make healthcare more relevant to the population with mental illness. In this editorial, I discuss a set of challenges which remain for the population with mental illness in the healthcare system, and the prospects for change. These challenges include: (1) improving basic mental healthcare in primary care, (2) improving mental healthcare for children, (3) earlier detection and treatment of psychotic illness, (4) disability and unemployment and (5) the challenge of sustaining an adequate, speciality public mental healthcare system under conditions of mainstreaming. In general, I conclude that the prospects for successful reform are uncertain.

Incarceration can cause harm to individual and community health, but prisons and jails also hold enormous potential to play an active and beneficial role in the health care system and, ultimately, to improving health. Traditionally, incarcerated populations have been incorrectly viewed as isolated and self-contained communities with only peripheral importance to the public health at large. This misconception has resulted in missed opportunities to positively affect the health of both the individuals and the imprisoned community as a whole and potentially to mitigate risk behaviors that may contribute to incarceration. Both community and correctional health care professionals can capitalize on these opportunities by working together to advocate for the health of the criminal justice-involved population and their communities.

The ACA also required each state to implement an adequate external review process. Iowa's appellate courts have not decided whether the external review process is ""exclusive""-meaning covered persons must use the process to challenge insurers' adverse benefit determinations-or ""cumulative""-meaning covered persons may bypass the process and file an action in a district court. This Note argues that Iowa's external review process is cumulative. The application of two rules of statutory interpretation-the new-right test and the comprehensive-scheme test-suggests that courts should construe Iowa's external review statute as a supplement to, rather than a replacement of, a covered person's commonlaw rights against an insurer. While the external review process provides a covered person with beneficial protections and a faster, less expensive, and often more convenient means to challenge an insurer's denial of coverage, its short statute of limitations, exclusion of oral testimony, and limited jurisdiction may motivate a covered person to pursue traditional litigation in some circumstances."

Payers consider readmission rates after total joint arthroplasty an indicator of quality. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act contains provisions that preclude payment of hospital cost associated with joint arthroplasty readmissions occurring within 30 days of discharge. This study evaluates the readmission rates and the incidence of ""never events"" after inpatient shoulder arthroplasty procedures. Methods: A retrospective view of all shoulder arthroplasty was performed from 2005 to 2011, with specific emphasis on the readmission rate 30, 60, and 90 days after the procedure. The incidence of never events as defined by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services was also analyzed. Results: During the study period, 680 shoulder arthroplasty procedures were performed. Overall readmission rate was 5.9%. For hemiarthroplasty (HA), total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA), and reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (RTSA), 90-day readmission rates were 8.8%, 4.5%, and 6.6%, respectively. Readmission rates within 30 days of admission were significantly more common for HA and RTSA compared with readmission rates after 30 days. There was a 1.0% incidence of never events, and the incidence associated with each of the 3 arthroplastic procedures did not differ significantly. Conclusion: Readmission within the first 90 days after shoulder arthroplasty occurred in 5.9% of patients. There was a 1% incidence of never events. In addition, most readmissions after HA and RTSA occurred within 30 days of discharge. As health care expenditures become more closely scrutinized, readmission rates after shoulder arthroplasty will become increasingly important. © 2014 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees."

Such disparities are evident and similarly persistent in the treatment of patients with chronic pain conditions, exacting high personal and societal costs. While psychosocial factors contribute significantly to this intractable problem, an integrated examination of the literature is lacking. This article provides an overview of psychosocial factors that contribute to disparities in the treatment of chronic pain patients and in their adjustment to pain. It focuses initially on aspects of pain assessment that can occasion disparate care. Because pain is a subjective phenomenon that often defies objective medical assessment, it is particularly susceptible to social psychological influences, such as stereotypes. We pay particular attention to negative racial/ethnic stereotypes as well as to the circumstances that are likely to trigger stereotype-driven judgments. Subsequent sections review psychosocial factors that can influence a patient's experience of pain, those that can influence the patient-provider interaction, and those that operate in the public health environment. After each section, we suggest actions that could address identified issues related to clinical care, research, and policy. Policy recommendations generally are linked to provisions of the Affordable Care Act.

Academic center practice setting, bias toward the PPACA, and Democratic Party affiliation were associated with significantly more correct responses. Conclusion. Overall physician knowledge of the PPACA is assessed as fair, although better than the general public in 2010. There are several areas where knowledge of physicians regarding the PPACA is poor, and this knowledge deficit is more pronounced within certain subgroups. These knowledge issues should be addressed by individual physicians and medical societies. © 2013 American Academy of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery Foundation."

OBJECTIVE: To assess U.S. physicians' impressions about the direction of U.S. health care under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), whether that legislation will make reimbursement more or less fair, and examine how those judgments relate to political affiliation and perceived social responsibility. DESIGN: A cross-sectional, mailed, self-reported survey. PARTICIPANTS: Simple random sample of 3,897 U.S. physicians. MAIN MEASURES: Views on the ACA in general, reimbursement under the ACA in particular, and perceived social responsibility. KEY RESULTS: Among 2,556 physicians who responded (RR2: 65 %), approximately two out of five (41 %) believed that the ACA will turn U.S. health care in the right direction and make physician reimbursement less fair (44 %). Seventy-two percent of physicians endorsed a general professional obligation to address societal health policy issues, 65 % agreed that every physician is professionally obligated to care for the uninsured or underinsured, and half (55 %) were willing to accept limits on coverage for expensive drugs and procedures for the sake of expanding access to basic health care. In multivariable analyses, liberals and independents were both substantially more likely to endorse the ACA (OR 33.0 [95 % CI, 23.6-46.2]; OR 5.0 [95 % CI, 3.7-6.8], respectively), as were physicians reporting a salary (OR 1.7 [95 % CI, 1.2-2.5]) or salary plus bonus (OR 1.4 [95 % CI, 1.1-1.9) compensation type. In the same multivariate models, those who agreed that addressing societal health policy issues are within the scope of their professional obligations (OR 1.5 [95 % CI, 1.0-2.0]), who believe physicians are professionally obligated to care for the uninsured / under-insured (OR 1.7 [95 % CI, 1.3-2.4]), and who agreed with limiting coverage for expensive drugs and procedures to expand insurance coverage (OR 2.3 [95 % CI, 1.8-3.0]), were all significantly more likely to endorse the ACA. Surgeons and procedural specialists were less likely to endorse it (OR 0.5 [95 % CI, 0.4-0.7], OR 0.6 [95 % CI, 0.5-0.9], respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Significant subsets of U.S. physicians express concerns about the direction of U.S. health care under recent health care reform legislation. Those opinions appear intertwined with political affiliation, type of medical specialty, as well as perceived social responsibility. © 2013 Society of General Internal Medicine."

This article offers an economic framework that abstracts away from the details of operations research to understand the fundamental disincentives to improving wait times. Hospitals that reduce wait times are financially penalized if they must provide more uncompensated care as a result. Pending changes under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act are considered. We find that the likely effect of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act's insurance expansion is to reduce this penalty for improving ED wait times. Consequently, mandating adoption of solutions to ED crowding may be unnecessary and counterproductive.

As the 2014 deadline for establishing exchanges approaches, states face choices: they can either allow the federal government to manage an exchange on their behalf; take on a minimalist role by managing a state exchange or partnering with the federal exchange; or assume an activist role-by aiming to influence the price, design, and quality of the health insurance options available through exchanges and taking steps to support consumers' ability to choose among these options. This article discusses states' choices and the governance issues that they raise, first by describing the extent of discretion that states have in shaping the range of health plans on offer as well as the issues they will need to consider in choosing an exchange model. We then discuss the considerable body of evidence that addresses howpeople behave in individual insurance markets, concluding that it strongly supports the need for states to take an active role in shaping health insurance exchanges and ensuring that they support consumer choice. © 2014 by Duke University Press."

Drawing on real-time accounts published in the Capitol Hill newspaper Roll Call, we compare the success of Democratic and Republican Parties' policy proposals in terms of centrality to the policy agenda and inclusion in the enacted legislation. Our findings indicate that Republican-backed proposals were more present on the policy agenda than in the final legislation-although both were dominated by Democratic policy proposals.

States could maximize control over decision making and avoid federal intervention by establishing their own health insurance exchanges. Yet GOP leaders feared that creating exchanges would entrench a law they intensely opposed and undermine legal challenges to the ACA. Republicans' calculations were further complicated by uncertainty over the Supreme Court's ruling on the ACA's constitutionality and the outcome of the November 2012 elections. In the first year of operation, only seventeen states and the District of Columbia chose to design and implement their own exchanges; another six partnered with the federal government, and twenty-seven states ceded control to Washington. Out of thirty states with Republican governors in 2013, only four launched their own exchange. Why did many Republican-led states that initially appeared open to establishing exchanges ultimately reverse course? Drawing on interviews with state policy makers and secondary data, we trace the evolution of Republican responses to the exchange dilemma during 2010-13. We explore how exchanges became controversial and explainwhy so few Republican-led states opted for their own exchange, focusing on the intensifying resistance to Obamacare amid a rightward shift in state politics, partisan polarization, and uncertainty over the ACA's fate. © 2014 by Duke University Press."

Through focused comparison with the Bismarckian systems of France and Germany, on the one hand, and with the 1950s and 1960s in the United States, on the other, this article concludes that while institutional elements do account for some of the observed behavior of big business, a necessary complement to this is a fuller understanding of the historically determined legitimating ideology of US firms. From the era of the ""corporate commonwealth,"" US business inherited the principles of private welfare provision and of resistance to any expansion of government control. Once complementary, these principles are now mutually exclusive: Employer-provided health insurance increasingly is possible only at the cost of ever-increasing government subsidy and regulation. Paralyzed by the uncertainty that followed from this clash of legitimate ideas, major employers found themselves unable to take a coherent and unified stand for or against the law.

Study design Data for this study come from a subset of the 3207 women aged 18-39 years who responded to two waves of a national longitudinal survey. This analysis focused on the 889 women who were using hormonal contraceptive methods in both the fall 2012 and spring 2013 waves and the 343 women who used the intrauterine device at either wave. Women were asked about the amount they paid out of pocket in an average month for their method of choice. Results Between Wave 1 and Wave 2, the proportion of privately insured women paying zero dollars out of pocket for oral contraceptives increased substantially, from 15% to 40%; by contrast, there was no significant change among publicly insured or uninsured women (whose coverage was not affected by the new federal requirement). Similar changes were seen among privately insured women using the vaginal ring. Conclusions The initial implementation of the federal contraceptive coverage requirement appears to have had a notable impact on the out-of-pocket costs paid by privately insured women. Additional progress is likely as the requirement phases in to apply to more private plans, but with evidence that not all methods are being treated equally, policymakers should consider stepped-up oversight and enforcement of the provision. Implications This study measures the out-of-pocket costs for women with private, public and no insurance prior to the federal contraceptive coverage requirement and after it took effect; in doing so, it highlights areas of progress in eliminating these costs and areas that need further progress. © 2014 The Authors."

Understanding whether and how restaurant menus evolve in response to labeling laws and public health pressures could inform future efforts to improve the food environment. Objectives: To track changes in the energy and sodium content of US chain restaurant main entrées between spring 2010 (when the Affordable Care Act was passed, which included a federal menu labeling requirement) and spring 2011. Design: Nutrition information was collected from top US chain restaurants' websites, comprising 213 unique brands. Descriptive statistics and regression analysis evaluated change across main entrées overall and compared entrées that were added, removed, and unchanged. Tests of means and proportions were conducted for individual restaurant brands to see how many made significant changes. Separate analyses were conducted for children's menus. Results: Mean energy and sodium did not change significantly overall, although mean sodium was 70 mg lower across all restaurants in added vs removed menu items at the 75th percentile. Changes were specific to restaurant brands or service model: family-style restaurants reduced sodium among higher-sodium entrées at the 75th percentile, but not on average, and entrées still far exceeded recommended limits. Fast-food restaurants decreased mean energy in children's menu entrées by 40 kcal. A few individual restaurant brands made significant changes in energy or sodium, but the vast majority did not, and not all changes were in the healthier direction. Among those brands that did change, there were slightly more brands that reduced energy and sodium compared with those that increased it. Conclusions: Industry marketing and pledges may create a misleading perception that restaurant menus are becoming substantially healthier, but both healthy and unhealthy menu changes can occur simultaneously. Our study found no meaningful changes overall across a 1-year time period. Longer-term studies are needed to track changes over time, particularly after the federal menu labeling law is implemented. © 2014 Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics."

Hospitals more likely to have telehealth capabilities are teaching hospitals, those equipped with additional advanced medical technology, those that are members of a larger system, and those that are nonprofit institutions. Rates of hospital telehealth adoption by state vary substantially and are associated with differences in state policy.

Many U.S. adults have multiple behavioral risk factors, and effective, scalable interventions are needed to promote population-level health. In the health care setting, interventions are often provided in print, although accessible to nearly everyone, are brief (e.g., pamphlets), are not interactive, and can require some logistics around distribution. Web-based interventions offer more interactivity but may not be accessible to all. Healthy Directions 2 was a primary care-based cluster randomized controlled trial designed to improve five behavioral cancer risk factors among a diverse sample of adults (n = 2,440) in metropolitan Boston. Intervention materials were available via print or the web. Purpose. To (a) describe the Healthy Directions 2 study design and (b) identify baseline factors associated with whether participants opted for print or web-based materials. Methods. Hierarchical regression models corrected for clustering by physician were built to examine factors associated with choice of intervention modality. Results. At baseline, just 4.0% of participants met all behavioral recommendations. Nearly equivalent numbers of intervention participants opted for print and web-based materials (44.6% vs. 55.4%). Participants choosing web-based materials were younger, and reported having a better financial status, better perceived health, greater computer comfort, and more frequent Internet use (p <.05) than those opting for print. In addition, Whites were more likely to pick web-based material than Black participants. Conclusions. Interventions addressing multiple behaviors are needed in the primary care setting, but they should be available in web and print formats as nearly equal number of participants chose each option, and there are significant differences in the population groups using each modality. © 2013 Society for Public Health Education."

(1) Assuming Medicaid expansion in each of the fifty states and the District of Columbia, a larger proportion of the rural (non-metropolitan) uninsured (43.5%) than the urban uninsured (38.5%) would be eligible for Medicaid. (2) In both urban and rural places, across the adult non-elderly population, uninsured rates decline dramatically with age. (3) Within each age group of the uninsured, rural people are less likely to have incomes above 400% of the federal poverty level (FPL), meaning that overall more rural uninsured would be eligible for some form of health insurance assistance under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), either subsidized coverage in new marketplaces, or through Medicaid if all states were to implement expansion. (4) While over half of the uninsured in both rural and urban areas are younger than 40 years, the uninsured in rural areas are disproportionately older across all income categories, which reflects the age distribution in the population."

If policymakers are to further encourage implementation of culture change, they need to better understand the factors associated with implementation. Design and Methods: Using logistic regression (N = 16,835), we examined the extent to which resident, facility, and state characteristics relate to a nursing home being identified by experts as having implemented culture change over the period 2004 through 2011. Results: At baseline, the 291 facilities that were later identified by experts to have implemented culture change were more often nonprofit-owned, larger in size, and had fewer Medicaid and Medicare residents. Implementers also had better baseline quality with fewer health-related survey deficiencies and greater licensed practical nurse and nurse aide staffing. States experienced greater culture change implementation when they paid a higher Medicaid per diem.

Primary Data Source Medicare hospital cost reports (1996-2009). Study Design For each hospital, we quantify the year-to-year price impacts from changes in the Medicare payment formula. We use cumulative simulated price impacts as instruments for Medicare inpatient revenues. We use a series of two-stage least squares panel data regressions to estimate the effects of changes in Medicare revenues among all hospitals, and separately among not-for-profit versus for-profit hospitals, and among hospitals experiencing real price increases (""gainers"") versus decreases (""losers"") . Principal Findings Medicare price cuts are associated with reductions in overall revenues even larger than the direct Medicare price effect, consistent with price spillovers. Among not-for-profit hospitals, revenue reductions are fully offset by reductions in operating expenses, and profits are unchanged. Among for-profit hospitals, revenue reductions decrease profits one-for-one. Responses of gainers and losers are roughly symmetrical. Conclusions On average, hospitals do not appear to make up for Medicare cuts by ""cost shifting,"" but by adjusting their operating expenses over the long run. The Medicare price cuts in the Affordable Care Act will ""bend the curve,"" that is, significantly slow the growth in hospitals' total revenues and operating expenses. © Published 2013.

METHODS: A review of natural history and technical data was conducted. RESULTS: Homozygous ZZ AAT deficiency is a common genetic disease occurring in 1 in 2000 to 3500 births; however, it is underrecognized and most patients are undiagnosed. AAT deficiency can cause chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, and liver failure in children and adults, and lung disease in adults. The clinical course is highly variable. Some neonates present with cholestatic hepatitis and some children require liver transplantation, but many patients remain well into adulthood. Some adults develop emphysema. There is no treatment for AAT liver disease, other than supportive care and liver transplant. There are no data on the effect of early diagnosis on liver disease. Avoidance of smoking is of proven benefit to reduce future lung disease, as is protein replacement therapy. Justifying newborn screening with the aim of reducing smoking and reducing adult lung disease-years in the future would be a significant paradigm shift for the screening field. Recent passage of the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) and the Affordable Care Act may have a major effect on reducing the psychosocial and financial risks of newborn screening because many asymptomatic children would be identified. Data on the risk-benefit ratio of screening in the new legal climate are lacking.

We also describe factors associated with on-site availability and specific challenges and barriers to providing on-site access to LARC as reported by FQHCs. Study design An original survey of 423 FQHC organizations was fielded in 2011. Results Over two thirds of FQHCs offer on-site availability of intrauterine devices yet only 36% of FQHCs report that they offer on-site contraceptive implants. Larger FQHCs and FQHCs receiving Title X Family Planning program funding are more likely to provide on-site access to LARC methods. Other organizational and patient characteristics are associated with the on-site availability of LARC methods, though this relationship varies by the type of method. The most commonly reported barriers to providing on-site access to LARC methods are related to the cost of stocking or supplying the drug and/or device, the perceived lack of staffing and training, and the unique needs of special populations. Conclusion Our findings indicate that patients seeking care in small FQHC organizations, FQHCs with limited dedicated family planning funding and FQHCs located in rural areas may have fewer choices and limited access to LARC methods on-site. Implications Despite the presumed widespread coverage of contraceptives for women as a result of provisions in the Affordable Care Act, there is a limited understanding of how FQHCs may redesign their practices to provide on-site availability of LARC methods.

As such, the traditional patient interaction with an independent medical provider is becoming far less common, replaced by frequent interactions with integrated medical groups and health systems. It is thus increasingly important for these organizations to have an effective social media presence. Moreover, in the age of the informed consumer, patients desire a readily accessible, electronic interface to initiate contact, making a well-designed website and social media strategy critical features of the modern health care organization. Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess the Web presence of hospitals and their health systems on five dimensions: accessibility, content, marketing, technology, and usability. In addition, an overall ranking was calculated to identify the top 100 hospital and health system websites. Methods: A total of 2407 unique Web domains covering 2785 hospital facilities or their parent organizations were identified and matched against the 2009 American Hospital Association (AHA) Annual Survey. This is a four-fold improvement in prior research and represents what the authors believe to be a census assessment of the online presence of US hospitals and their health systems. Each of the five dimensions was investigated with an automated content analysis using a suite of tools. Scores on the dimensions are reported on a range from 0 to 10, with a higher score on any given dimension representing better comparative performance. Rankings on each dimension and an average ranking are provided for the top 100 hospitals. Results: The mean score on the usability dimension, meant to rate overall website quality, was 5.16 (SD 1.43), with the highest score of 8 shared by only 5 hospitals. Mean scores on other dimensions were between 4.43 (SD 2.19) and 6.49 (SD 0.96). Based on these scores, rank order calculations for the top 100 websites are presented. Additionally, a link to raw data, including AHA ID, is provided to enable researchers and practitioners the ability to further explore relationships to other dynamics in health care. Conclusions: This census assessment of US hospitals and their health systems provides a clear indication of the state of the sector. While stakeholder engagement is core to most discussions of the role that hospitals must play in relation to communities, management of an online presence has not been recognized as a core competency fundamental to care delivery. Yet, social media management and network engagement are skills that exist at the confluence of marketing and technical prowess. This paper presents performance guidelines evaluated against best-demonstrated practice or independent standards to facilitate improvement of the sector's use of websites and social media."

Bundled payments, value-based purchasing, and accountable care organizations transfer financial risk from payers to health care systems. The goal of health care systems that adopt risk contracts is to contain costs due to the increase in financial pressures as Medicaid expands and reimbursements for Medicare and fee-for-service care shrink. Accountable care organization contracts have shown promise in slowing the increase in medical expenditures for public and private payers.Some health care systems hold ownership in an associated health plan, with increasing numbers of systems developing new ways of engaging with health plans. Physicians and hospitals must distinguish between different types of arrangements. A full ownership partnership encompasses joint governance between the insurance plan and health care system; all participants in the plan receive care from the associated health system. In partial ownership, the health care system owns a stake in the insurer, but governance and care relationships are not totally overlapping. In a partnership, the formal relationship with the insurance plan preferentially refers patients to the health care system, and the system enters into risk contracts for the patients. Finally, in contractual arrangements, health systems enter into risk-bearing contracts with insurance plans for specific patient populations.For health systems that assume risk, the arrangement drives integration, such that most of a patient's health care needs and associated payments are addressed by a single network, allowing care to be better coordinated. Care provided outside the network is paid for by the insurer. Cost savings are generated by decreasing volume-based incentives in fee-for-service payment systems that can create overuse. Linking health care systems and payers can also overcome a lack of price transparency.One challenge is whether health care system-insurer partnerships will conflict with existing state and federal regulations designed to maintain a competitive marketplace. These include antitrust regulations, bans on the corporate practice of medicine, and prohibitions on fee-splitting. Another concern is that the health care system and insurers do not necessarily have the same goals and human resources. Merging these models will require significant investments of energy and capital that may distract from core activities. In addition, most health systems are ill-equipped to handle the complex operations of the insurance business. Systems must maintain adequate capital reserves to be a financially viable health plan. Therefore, health systems must be more judicious about assuming risk and managing population health and costs.Successful partnerships between health care systems and insurers will require certain components. (1) The integrated arrangement must rest on a foundation of high-functioning primary health care. (2) It must incorporate system-wide processes for quality improvement. (3) It must engage patients with outreach initiatives for disease self-management and preventive care. (4) Systems must be able to manage costs of care. With care delivery transformation as the ultimate goal, the leaders of health systems must nurture and build on momentum in a sustainable way. © 2014 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins."

While the reasons for uninsurance among young adults have been documented, how they operate and are perceived on an individual level have not been explored in great detail. Further, it is poorly understood how the ACA policies and the state health insurance exchanges can serve young adults. Thus, we interviewed uninsured young adults aged 18-35 in northeastern Minnesota and northwestern Wisconsin and used inductive thematic analysis to explore these issues. Findings suggest that young adults don't feel at risk for health problems and therefore have low levels of health insurance literacy and place little value on health insurance. Multiple barriers to health insurance coverage, including the provision about staying on a parent's policy, persist despite the ACA.

""Consumer directed health care"" proposals, which provide patients with financial incentives to equate marginal costs and benefits of care at the point of treatment, demand more decisionmaking ability from consumers than is plausible due to bounded rationality. Proposals that seek to change the incentives of health care providers threaten to create conflicts of interest between doctors and patients. New approaches are desperately needed. This Article proposes a government-facilitated but market-based approach to improving efficiency in the private market for medical care that I call ""relative value health insurance."" This approach focuses on the ""choice architecture"" necessary to enable even boundedly rational patients to contract for an efficient level of health care services through their health insurance purchase decisions. It uses comparative effectiveness research, which the ACA funds at a significant level for the first time, to rate medical treatments on a scale of one to ten based on their relative value, taking into account expected costs and benefits. These relative value ratings would enable consumers to contract with insurers for different levels of medical care at different prices, reflecting different cost-quality trade-offs. The Article describes both the benefits of relative value health insurance and the impediments to its implementation. It concludes with a brief discussion of how relative value ratings could also help to rationalize expenditures on public health insurance programs."

As a result of the Affordable Care Act, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services incorporated PSS into a formula designed to determine the quality of medical care delivered to hospital inpatients; the resultant score and rank will determine subsequent hospital payments. This survey was developed to evaluate POSNA members' knowledge of and experience with PSS. METHODS: The POSNA Practice Management Committee developed a 14-question survey that was sent to all active and candidate members (850). A total of 229 members responded; and results were tabulated by answer and simple percentages were calculated for each question. Comments were reviewed and grouped by similarity to identify frequency. RESULTS: A total of 82% of respondents were aware of PSS with 67% stating they were utilized in their setting. Utilization of PSS rarely alters clinical decision making. However, PSS do affect decisions regarding the patient experience; and 45% of respondents believe that PSS have utility with respect to business decisions. Fifty-nine percent of respondents feel that scores can be predictably improved. Less than half the respondents stated that they had a good or excellent understanding of PSS and only 48% believe that PSS are a valid measure of health care quality. CONCLUSIONS: POSNA members' knowledge of and experience with PSS are not universal or uniform. Although most agree that patient satisfaction does not drive clinical decision making, it does appear to impact business and clinic-flow decisions with the idea that it can be predictably improved. Despite this, members' self-assessed that knowledge is average and it is not clear to the members that patient satisfaction reflects medical quality. On the basis of these findings and as the impacts of PSS become more prominent, efforts to educate the members of POSNA about PSS should be enhanced. Furthermore, research to identify and develop best practices that enhance patient satisfaction and well-being while minimizing costs should be supported. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV."

There is a debate regarding the effect of cost sharing on immunization, particularly as the Affordable Care Act will eliminate cost sharing for recommended vaccines. This study estimates changes in immunization rates and spending associated with extending first-dollar coverage to privately insured children for four childhood vaccines. Methods. We used the 2008 National Immunization Survey and peer-reviewed literature to generate estimates of immunization status for each vaccine by age group and insurance type. We used the Truven Health Analytics 2006 MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters Database of line-item medical claims to estimate changes in immunization rates that would result from eliminating cost sharing, and we used the Kaiser Family Foundation/Health Research and Educational Trust Employer Health Benefits Survey to determine the prevalence of coverage for patients with first-dollar coverage, patients who face office visit cost sharing, and patients who face cost sharing for all vaccine cost components. We assumed that once cost sharing is removed, coverage rates in plans that impose cost sharing will rise to the level of plans that do not. Results. We estimate that immunization rates would increase modestly and result in additional direct spending of $26.0 million to insurers/employers. Further, these payers would have an additional $11.0 million in spending associated with eliminating cost sharing for children already receiving immunizations. Conclusions. The effects of eliminating cost sharing for vaccines vary by vaccine. Overall, immunization rates will rise modestly given high insurance coverage for vaccinations, and these increases would be more substantial for those currently facing cost sharing. However, in addition to the removal of cost sharing for immunizations, these findings suggest other strategies to consider to further increase immunization rates."

Currently, few SAT providers accept Medicaid, and consequently, there is concern that newly-eligible Medicaid enrollees will have difficulty finding SAT providers willing to serve them. However, little is known about why few SAT providers accept Medicaid. In response, this study examines how features of state Medicaid coverage for SAT, including benefits, eligibility, and oversight, are associated with Medicaid acceptance among SAT providers. Medicaid acceptance was positively associated with the number of SAT services covered, and the number of optional categorical expansions implemented by the state. Requirements for physician involvement were associated with lower odds of acceptance. The results suggest that more generous Medicaid coverage may encourage SAT providers to accept Medicaid, but regulatory policies may inhibit their ability to do so. © 2014 National Council for Behavioral Health."

Comparison with countries providing universal coverage may illustrate whether the ACA can improve health outcomes and reduce disparities. We aimed to compare quality and disparities in hypertension management by socio-economic position in the US and England, the latter of which has universal health care. Method: We used data from the Health and Retirement Survey in the US, and the English Longitudinal Study for Aging from England, including non-Hispanic White respondents aged 50-64 years (US market-based v NHS) and >65 years (US-Medicare v NHS) with diagnosed hypertension. We compared blood pressure control to clinical guideline (140/90 mmHg) and audit (150/90 mmHg) targets; mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure and antihypertensive prescribing, and disparities in each by educational attainment, income and wealth, using regression models. Results: There were no significant differences in aggregate achievement of clinical targets aged 50 to 65 years (US market-based vs. NHS- 62.3% vs. 61.3% [p = 0.835]). There was, however, greater control in the US in patients aged 65 years and over (US Medicare vs. NHS- 53.5% vs. 58.2% [p = 0.043]). England had no significant socioeconomic disparity in blood pressure control (60.9% vs. 63.5% [p = 0.588], high and low wealth aged ≥65 years). The US had socioeconomic differences in the 50-64 years group (71.7% vs. 55.2% [p = 0.003], high and low wealth); these were attenuated but not abolished in Medicare beneficiaries. Conclusion: Moves towards universal health coverage in the US may reduce disparities in hypertension management. The current situation, providing universal coverage for residents aged 65 years and over, may not be sufficient for equality in care. © 2014 Dalton et al."

Methods We used 2009 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey to (1) compare young adults' health care utilization and expenditures of a full-spectrum of health services to children and adolescents and (2) identify disparities in young adults' utilization and expenditures, based on access (insurance and usual source of care) and other sociodemographic factors, including race/ethnicity and income. Results Young adults had (1) significantly lower rates of overall utilization (72%) than other age groups (83%-88%, p <.001), (2) the lowest rate of office-based utilization (55% vs. 67%-77%, p <.001) and (3) higher rate of emergency room visits compared with adolescents (15% vs. 12%, p <.01). Uninsured young adults had high out-of-pocket expenses. Compared with the young adults with private insurance, the uninsured spent less than half on health care ($1,040 vs. $2,150/person, p <.001) but essentially the same out-of-pocket expenses ($403 vs. $380/person, p =.57).

The analysis sample is adults ages 22-64 years.Principal Findings Incomes are highly variable within a year, particularly at the lower end of the income distribution. Employment transitions, including transitions not involving a period of nonemployment, and family structure changes strongly predict sufficient income volatility to trigger a change in subsidy category.Conclusions Income volatility arising from employment and family structure changes is likely to trigger changes in subsidy eligibility within the year, but the sources and effects of the volatility differ substantially depending on the individual's position in the income distribution. © Health Research and Educational Trust."

This extension may have affected how young adults use emergency department (ED) care and other health services. To test the impact of the ACA on how young adults used ED services, we used 2009-11 state administrative records from California, Florida, and New York to compare changes in ED use in young adults ages 19-25 before and after the ACA provision was implemented with changes in the same period for people ages 26-31 (the control group). Following implementation of the ACA provision, the younger group had a decrease of 2.7 ED visits per 1,000 people compared to the older group-a relative change of -2.1 percent. The largest relative decreases were found in women (-3.0 percent) and blacks (-3.4 percent). This relative decrease in ED use implies a total reduction of more than 60,000 visits from young adults ages 19-25 across the three states in 2011. When we compared the probability of ever using the ED before and after implementation of the ACA provision, we found a minimal decrease (-0.4 percent) among the younger group compared to the older group. This suggests that the change in the number of visits was driven by fewer visits among ED users, not by changes in the number of people who ever visited the ED. © 2014 Project HOPE- The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc."

This study was designed to estimate the rate of underinsurance in primary care safety net clinics serving low income, multiethnic populations in New Mexico.Methods: Data were collected from 2 primary care clinics in an urban setting during a 2-week period in 2011 and 2012. Voluntary, anonymous, self-administered surveys were distributed to adult patients waiting to be seen by their doctor. Surveys were available in English and Spanish.Results: Of those insured, 44% were underinsured. The underinsured comprised higher proportions of patients who were Hispanic, young, and poor; 39% reported fair or poor health, 23% reported that their health suffered from an inability to seek care because of cost, and 53% had either Medicaid or state coverage insurance. Patients with an income of ≤$25, 000 were 8 times more likely to be underinsured.Conclusion: A high level of underinsurance was found in these safety net clinics. Because millions of Americans gain health care insurance benefits, monitoring whether the current reform provides adequate health care coverage or whether those with new and existing health care insurance are underinsured is critical."

The purpose of risk adjustment is to lessen or eliminate the influence of risk selection on the premiums that plans charge and the incentive for plans to avoid sicker enrollees.This article —the first of three in the Medicare & Medicaid Research Review—describes the key program goal and issues in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) developed risk adjustment methodology, and identifies key choices in how the methodology responds to these issues. The goal of the HHS risk adjustment methodology is to compensate health insurance plans for differences in enrollee health mix so that plan premiums reflect differences in scope of coverage and other plan factors, but not differences in health status. The methodology includes a risk adjustment model and a risk transfer formula that together address this program goal as well as three issues specific to ACA risk adjustment: 1) new population; 2) cost and rating factors; and 3) balanced transfers within state/market. The risk adjustment model, described in the second article, estimates differences in health risks taking into account the new population and scope of coverage (actuarial value level). The transfer formula, described in the third article, calculates balanced transfers that are intended to account for health risk differences while preserving permissible premium differences. © 2014, Health Care Financing Administration.

Since insurance reduces the price of medical care, the quantity of services demanded by these newly covered individuals is expected to rise. In this article I provide a comprehensive picture of the demographics, health status, and medical care utilization of the population targeted for the ACA's expansion of coverage, contrasted with that of other nonelderly, insured populations. In addition, I synthesize the current evidence regarding the causal impact of insurance on medical care demand, drawing heavily on recent evidence from Massachusetts and Oregon. Methods Using the 2008 to 2010 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, I conducted bivariate and multivariate analyses to examine differences between the ACA target population and other insured groups. I used the results from the descriptive analysis and quasi-experimental literature to generate ""back of the envelope"" estimates of the potential impact of the coverage expansion on total medical care utilization by the noninstitutionalized US population. Findings Comparisons of the potential ACA target population with the privately and publicly insured reveal that the former is younger and more likely to be male. The ACA target population, and particularly the uninsured with incomes under 200% of the federal poverty line, reports lower rates of several medical conditions relative to those of the privately and publicly insured. Future changes in rates of inpatient hospitalization and ED use among the newly insured could vary widely, based on descriptive findings and inferences from the quasi-experimental literature. Results also suggest moderate increases in ambulatory care. Total increases in overall demand for medical care by the newly insured comprise a modest proportion of the aggregate utilization. Conclusions With the expected increases in utilization resulting from the coverage expansion, stakeholders will need to monitor local health care delivery system capacity and respond where needed with policy- and/or market-based innovations. © 2014 Milbank Memorial Fund."

OBJECTIVE: To examine the ACA's initial effects on young adults' receipt of preventive care. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Secondary data analysis using a pre-post design that compared health care use by young adults (aged 18 to 25 years) from 2009 and 2011 Medical Expenditure Panel Surveys. Data were collected through computer-assisted personal interviews of a nationally representative sample of the noninstitutionalized US population. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Differences by year in rates of receiving a routine examination in the past year, blood pressure screening, cholesterol screening, influenza vaccination, and annual dental visit. Three logistic regression models were developed to (1) compare pre-ACA (2009) and post-ACA (2011) rates of receiving preventive care and (2) determine if post-ACA increases in insurance coverage accounted for changes in preventive care rates. Model 1 was a bivariate model to determine differences in preventive care rates by year; model 2, a multivariable model adding insurance status (full-year private, full-year public, partial-year uninsured, and full-year uninsured) to determine whether insurance accounted for survey year differences; and model 3, a multivariable model adding covariates (usual source of care and sociodemographic variables) to determine whether they further accounted for differences by survey year or insurance status. RESULTS: After ACA, young adults had significantly higher rates of receiving a routine examination (47.8%vs 44.1%; P < .05), blood pressure screening (68.3%vs 65.2%; P < .05), cholesterol screening (29.1%vs 24.3%; P < .001), and annual dental visit (60.9%vs 55.2%; P < .001) but not an influenza vaccination (22.1% vs 21.5%; P = .70). Full-year private insurance coverage increased (50.1%vs 43.4%; P < .001), and rates of lacking insurance decreased (partial-year uninsured, 18.4%vs 20.7%; P = .03; and full-year uninsured, 22.2%vs 27.1%; P < .001). Full-year public insurance rates remained stable (9.4%vs 8.8%; P = .53). Insurance status fully accounted for the pre- and post-ACA differences in routine examination and blood pressure screening and partially accounted for year differences for cholesterol screening and annual dental visits. Covariate adjustment did not affect year differences. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The ACA provisions appear to increase insurance coverage and receipt of preventive services among young adults. Further studies are needed to replicate these findings as other ACA provisions are implemented. Copyright 2014 American Medical Association. All rights reserved."

With reforms of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) of 2010, case managers face new challenges and opportunities in providing care coordination services. The evolving roles of case managers as members of interprofessional care teams will be influenced by new policies that enable physicians to be reimbursed for care coordination. This qualitative study aimed to evaluate case managersÊ self-assessed readiness for ACA reforms of care coordination and their perceptions of physiciansÊ understanding of case management and ability to lead care coordination efforts in evolving models. PRIMARY PRACTICE SETTINGS: Provisions of care coordination in the ACA affect case managers in all practice settings. The majority of this studys participants represented hospital and managed care settings. METHODOLOGY AND SAMPLE: An invitation to complete an 11-item online survey was sent by e-mail to 8,110 case managers in an opt-in database maintained by a health care continuing education company. Survey questions were designed to assess respondentsÊ (1) self-reported levels of knowledge and preparation for ACA care coordination provisions and (2) beliefs about the readiness and abilities of physicians to administer care coordination services. In addition, demographic data and open-ended comments regarding physiciansÊ roles in conducting care coordination were collected. Over a restricted 9-day period, 834 case managers representing various health care settings responded to the survey. RESULTS: The majority of respondents (63%) indicated that more than 50% of their day is dedicated to performing care coordination activities. However, 80% of all respondents reported being ""not at all knowledgeable"" or only ""somewhat knowledgeable"" about the new care coordination provisions in the ACA. Only 8% admitted to being ""very prepared"" to implement ACA changes. The majority of respondents (68%) perceive their case management departments to be at least ""somewhat prepared"" to implement necessary changes. Whereas 67% of respondents expect physicians to have at least a ""moderate role"" in implementing care coordination services, only 12% believe that physicians have more than ""some"" understanding of the processes of care coordination and case managersÊ roles. IMPLICATIONS FOR CASE MANAGEMENT PRACTICE: These qualitative study findings suggest that case managers from multiple practice settings perceive a lack of preparedness, knowledge, and understanding among themselves and physicians regarding ACA reforms that may significantly affect the delivery of care coordination services. The findings call for new initiatives in interprofessional education to address the knowledge gaps and enhance understanding of the collaborative roles among case managers and physicians."

It represents the most extensive overhaul of the country's health care system since the passage of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965. The Affordable Care Act has two goals. The first goal is to reduce the uninsured population in the United States. Key elements to covering the uninsured include the following: (1) expanding Medicaid coverage for low-income individuals and (2) establishing health insurance marketplaces for moderate-income individuals with subsidies and tax cuts in an effort to make health insurance more affordable. The second goal of the Affordable Care Act is to address concerns about quality and the overall cost of U.S. health care.

Expansion of Medicaid was a key component of the legislation, as it was expected to provide coverage to low-income individuals, a population at greater risk for disparities in access to the health care system and in health outcomes. Several studies suggest that expansion of Medicaid can reduce insurance-related disparities, creating optimism surrounding the potential impact of the Affordable Care Act on the health of the poor. However, several impediments to the implementation of Medicaid's expansion and inadequacies within the Medicaid program itself will lessen its initial impact. In particular, the Supreme Court's decision to void the Affordable Care Act's mandate requiring all states to accept the Medicaid expansion allowed half of the states to forego coverage expansion, leaving millions of low-income individuals without insurance. Moreover, relative to many private plans, Medicaid is an imperfect program suffering from lower reimbursement rates, fewer covered services, and incomplete acceptance by preventive and specialty care providers. These constraints will reduce the potential impact of the expansion for patients with respiratory and sleep conditions or critical illness. Despite its imperfections, the more than 10 million low-income individuals who gain insurance as a result of Medicaid expansion will likely have increased access to health care, reduced out-of-pocket health care spending, and ultimately improvements in their overall health.

Recent findings Significant racial and ethnic disparities in maternal and reproductive health outcomes have persisted in recent years, contributing to poor outcomes and increasing costs. Pregnancy-related mortality ratios are up to three times higher in Black women compared with non-Hispanic White women, with the risk of severe maternal morbidity also significantly higher in Black and Hispanic women. Unintended pregnancy is twice as likely in minority women. Insurance status, socioeconomic status, and broader social determinants of health are implicated in these disparities. Coverage changes associated with the Affordable Care Act may provide some opportunities to reach communities most at risk. Delivery innovation, payment reform, and further public financing of key services are examples of further management approaches that can be used to address reproductive health disparities.

Unlike other developed nations, the United States does not provide universal health care coverage to its citizens. America relies primarily on private health insurance, allowing for protection against the high cost of illness. Because of the economic recession, many Americans cannot afford to pay for private health insurance. Contemporary nursing research is reviewing the question ""Is there is a difference in patient outcomes for the critically ill depending upon whether or not they have private health insurance?"" By using the Johns Hopkins Nursing Evidence-Based Practice Model (Johns Hopkins Nursing Evidenced-Based Practice Model and Guidelines. 2nd ed. Indianapolis, IN: Sigma Theta Tau International; 2012), 6 articles (level III and IV) were reviewed and summarized. After reviewing all the evidence, it is apparent that there are poorer patient outcomes, more specifically death in the critically ill patient population, if the patient does not have private health insurance. Current recommendations from these studies support the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (http://www.ehealthinsurance.com), which will take effect in 2014 and will enable uninsured individuals to have access to medical insurance. This provision can also improve preventative care and overall patient outcomes. This article has implications for the critical care nurse in the following ways: First, it will help the nurse to interpret the implications of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and how it will impact critical care practice; second, it validates the challenges that uninsured patients present to acute health care facilities as they come with more complications and consequently are at greater risk for complications; third, it magnifies that the critical care nurse may see millions of new patients; and fourth, it demonstrates for the critical care nurse how to use the Johns Hopkins Nursing Evidence-Based Practice Model to answer questions.

Here we compare payment for medical homes with that for accountable care organizations, consider opportunities for integration, and discuss implications for policy makers and payers considering ACO models. The PCMH and ACO are complementary approaches to reformed care delivery: the PCMH ultimately requires strong integration with specialists and hospitals as seen under ACOs, and ACOs likely will require a high functioning primary care system as embodied by the PCMH.

Methods: Data were from Medical Expenditure Panel Surveys (2006-2010), and logistic regression was used for the analysis. Results: Among persons with depression and private coverage, racial-ethnic minority groups were significantly less likely than non-Hispanic whites to use antidepressants (N=4,468; adjusted odds ratio [AOR]=.50, 95% confidence interval [CI]=.33-.66 for non-Hispanic blacks; AOR=.70, CI=.55-.89 for Hispanics). No significant racial-ethnic disparity in the use of antidepressants was found in Medicare (N=1,944), Medicaid (N=2,125), and uninsured populations (N=1,679). For all racial-ethnic groups, persons with no insurance coverage had much lower rates of antidepressant use than their insured counterparts. Conclusions: A wide racial-ethnic gap in the use of antidepressants existed in private coverage. As the nation continues to implement the Affordable Care Act, which will increase the number of enrollees from racial-ethnic minority groups in private plans, continuing efforts will be needed to reduce racial-ethnic disparities in the use of antidepressants.

Method: Data were from the Massachusetts Standard Certificate of Live Births on 1,156,472 babies from 1996 to 2010. A parent reported whether the mother smoked during pregnancy (yes/no), her race (5 options) and, separately, her ethnicity (39 categories). Prenatal smoking rates were compared between the ACA and OMB standards. Detailed ethnicity from the birth certificate was then examined within all broad categories of the ACA standards: White, Black/African American, Other Hispanic, Other Asian/Pacific Islander, and Other categories. Results: For Hispanic/Latina and Asian mothers, the ACA standards captured the variability in smoking across and within racial/ethnic groups more than the OMB standards. However, for White and Black/African American mothers, the broad ACA categories masked striking differences in prenatal smoking. While the overall prevalence among Whites was 10.2%, this ranged from 0.8% for Iranians to 21.0% for Cape Verdeans. Among Black/African Americans (7.6%), this ranged from 0.5% for Nigerians to 12.9% for African Americans.

To redress this, innovative forms of health insurance coverage have to be explored. This study analyses factors associated with willingness to pay for cross-border, bi-national health insurance (BHI) among Mexican immigrants in the US. Surveys were administered to 1,335 Mexican migrants in the Mexican Consulate of Los Angeles to assess their health status, healthcare utilization, and willingness to purchase BHI. Logistic regression was used to identify predictors of willingness to pay for BHI. Having a job, not having health insurance in the US, and relatives in Mexico attending public health services were significant predictors of willingness to pay for BHI. In addition, individuals identified quality as the most important factor when considering BHI. In spite of the interest for BHI among 54 % of the sampled population, our study concludes that this type of coverage is unlikely to solve access to care challenges due to ACA eligibility among different Mexican immigrant populations. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC."

We examined gaps in receipt of services for adults with incomes below 400% of the federal poverty level compared with higher incomes. We then used a regression-based decomposition analysis to consider factors that explain the gaps in service use by income.Results. There were large income-related disparities in preventive care receipt for nonelderly adults. Differences in insurance coverage explain 25% to 40% of the disparities in preventive service use by income, but education, age, and health status are also important drivers.Conclusions. Expanding coverage to lower-income adults through the ACA is expected to increase their preventive care use.

The Affordable Care Act provides reimbursement incentives aimed at improving access to primary care services for new Medicaid beneficiaries; however, there are no such incentives for specialty services. Using the natural experiment of Medicaid expansion in New York (NY) State in October 2001, we examined whether Medicaid expansion increased access to common musculoskeletal procedures for Medicaid beneficiaries. METHODS: From the State Inpatient Database for NY State, we identified 19-to 64-year-old patients who underwent lower extremity large joint replacement, spine procedures, and upper/lower extremity fracture/dislocation repair from January 1998 to December 2006. We used interrupted time series analysis to evaluate the association between Medicaid expansion and trends in the relative and absolute number of Medicaid beneficiaries who underwent these musculoskeletal procedures. Results: Before Medicaid expansion, we observed a slight but steady temporal decline in the proportion of musculoskeletal surgical patients who were Medicaid beneficiaries. After expansion, this trend reversed, and by 5 years after Medicaid expansion, the proportion of musculoskeletal surgical patients who were Medicaid beneficiaries was 4.7 percentage points [95% confidence interval, 3.9-5.5] higher than expected, based on the preexpansion time trend.

However, surveys of caregivers suggest that gaps were prevalent in the United States prior to initiation of the ACA. Even fewer papers have addressed solutions (in light of the paucity of data describing the magnitude of the problem), and proposed solutions remain speculative and not grounded in objective data.Conclusions: There is reason to believe that a substantial proportion of U.S. citizens — those who are guaranteed a full complement of health services through Medicaid — have difficult or no access to some subspecialty services, many of which other citizens take for granted. This problem deserves greater attention to verify its existence, quantify its magnitude, and develop solutions. © 2014, Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine Inc. All rights reserved."

US policymakers have been looking at various ways to curb rising health-care costs in USA, including ways to promote the use of generic drugs in lieu of brand drugs. In this broader context, the implementation ofACA in December 2013 will introduce major changes in the pharmaceutical market. Design/methodology/approach – To fully understand the impact of such policy changes, we develop a structural model to study consumers’ buying behavior and firm competition in the post-patent ethical drug markets. We use the estimated model parameters to conduct four policy simulations to illustrate the effect of Obamacare on increasing the relative size of price-insensitive segment, reducing price sensitivity in the price-sensitive segment, providing brand price discount to Medicare patients previously in the “donut hole” and the effect of change in people’s attitude toward generics. Findings – Our model estimation reveals two classes of consumers with different price sensitivities. This heterogeneity explains the increase in the brand price after generic entry. We identify consumers’ switching costs between generic and brand drugs, as well as among different generics. From the policy simulation, we find that except the closure of Medicare donut hole, all other policy changes lead to increased usage of the focal molecule, and the efforts to increase insurance coverage and reduce the out of pocket payment for prescription drugs lead to increase in firm profit. Originality/value – This paper is the first to illustrate the potential policy effect of Obamacare through a structural model on post-patent ethical drug market."

The Affordable Care Act (ACA) provides for a program of risk adjustment in the individual and small group markets in 2014 as Marketplaces are implemented and new market reforms take effect. The purpose of risk adjustment is to lessen or eliminate the influence of risk selection on the premiums that plans charge. The risk adjustment methodology includes the risk adjustment model and the risk transfer formula.This article is the second of three in this issue of the Review that describe the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) risk adjustment methodology and focuses on the risk adjustment model. In our first companion article, we discuss the key issues and choices in developing the methodology. In this article, we present the risk adjustment model, which is named the HHS-Hierarchical Condition Categories (HHS-HCC) risk adjustment model. We first summarize the HHS-HCC diagnostic classification, which is the key element of the risk adjustment model. Then the data and methods, results, and evaluation of the risk adjustment model are presented. Fifteen separate models are developed. For each age group (adult, child, and infant), a model is developed for each cost sharing level (platinum, gold, silver, and bronze metal levels, as well as catastrophic plans). Evaluation of the risk adjustment models shows good predictive accuracy, both for individuals and for groups. Lastly, this article provides examples of how the model output is used to calculate risk scores, which are an input into the risk transfer formula. Our third companion paper describes the risk transfer formula. © 2014, Health Care Financing Administration. All rights reserved."

Method: Data were based on structured interviews with a nationally representative sample of 34,587 adults from the 2004-2005 Wave 2 of the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC). Psychiatric diagnoses were assessed with the Alcohol Use Disorder and Associated Disabilities Interview Schedule-IV. Results: Of the total sample, 6.4% were currently on Medicaid; 3.9% were uninsured and likely eligible for the Medicaid expansion (LEME); 8.6% were uninsured and not LEME but likely to participate in the health insurance exchanges; 4.6% were insured and LEME; and 76.6% were insured and not LEME. Among those uninsured, those LEME had a significantly higher prevalence of mood and anxiety disorders than those not LEME (odds ratios = 1.26-1.41). Among those insured, those LEME had a higher prevalence of mood, anxiety, substance use, and personality disorders than those not LEME (odds ratios = 1.78-2.41). Although there were few clinical differences between those currently on Medicaid and those LEME, those currently on Medicaid were more likely to use all types of services for mood, anxiety, and substance use disorders. Conclusions: The ACA may directly affect the 12.5% of the US adult population who are uninsured by requiring them to obtain insurance coverage. Given the high prevalence for various psychiatric disorders among those uninsured, state plans to expand Medicaid and create health insurance exchanges have potential to offer coverage to many adults with mental health needs, and states should carefully plan for comprehensive services. © Copyright 2014 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc."

By removing the barrier of shared costs for preventive care, it is expected that an increase in utilization of preventive care services will reduce the cost of chronic diseases. Early detection and treatment is anticipated to be less costly than treatment at full onset of chronic conditions. One concern of early detection of disease is the cost to treat. In reality, the confluence of early detection may result in greater overall expenditures. Even with improved access to preventive care benefits, cost-sharing of other health services remains a major component of insurance plans. In order to treat identified conditions or diseases, cost-sharing comes into play. With the greater adoption of cost-sharing insurance plans, expenditures on the part of enrollee are anticipated to rise. Once the healthcare recipients realize the implication of early identification and resultant treatment costs, enrollment in preventive care may decline. Healthcare legislation and regulation should consider the full spectrum of care and the microeconomic costs associated with preventive treatment. Although the system at large may not realize the immediate impact, behavioral shifts on the part of healthcare consumers may alter healthcare. Rather than the current status quo of treating presenting conditions, preventive treatment is largely anticipated to require more resources and may impact the consumer’s financial capacity. This report will explore how these two concepts are co-dependent, and highlight the need for continued reform. © 2014 by Kerman University of Medical Sciences."

To help evaluate the potential impact of the ACA on prostate cancer care, we examined the associations between insurance coverage and prostate cancer outcomes among men <65 years old who are not yet eligible for Medicare.Methods:The Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Program was used to identify 85 203 men aged <65 years diagnosed with prostate cancer from 2007 to 2010. Multivariable logistic regression modeled the association between insurance status and stage at presentation. Among men with high-risk disease, the associations between insurance status and receipt of definitive therapy, prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) and all-cause mortality were determined using multivariable logistic, Fine and Gray competing-risks and Cox regression models, respectively.Results:Uninsured patients were more likely to be non-white and come from regions of rural residence, lower median household income and lower education level (P<0.001 for all cases). Insured men were less likely to present with metastatic disease (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 0.23; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.20-0.27; P<0.001). Among men with high-risk disease, insured men were more likely to receive definitive treatment (AOR 2.29; 95% CI 1.81-2.89; P<0.001), and had decreased PCSM (adjusted hazard ratio 0.56; 95% CI 0.31-0.98; P=0.04) and all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio 0.60; 0.39-0.91; P=0.01).Conclusions:Insured men with prostate cancer are less likely to present with metastatic disease, more likely to be treated if they develop high-risk disease and are more likely to survive their cancer, suggesting that expanding health coverage under the ACA may significantly improve outcomes for men with prostate cancer who are not yet eligible for Medicare. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited."

Section 2713 of the PHS Act requires coverage without cost sharing of certain preventive health services by non-grandfathered group health plans and health insurance coverage. Among these services are women's preventive health services, as specified in guidelines supported by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA). As authorized by the current regulations, and consistent with the HRSA Guidelines, group health plans established or maintained by certain religious employers (and group health insurance coverage provided in connection with such plans) are exempt from the otherwise applicable requirement to cover certain contraceptive services. Additionally, under current regulations, accommodations are available with respect to the contraceptive coverage requirement for group health plans established or maintained by eligible organizations (and group health insurance coverage provided in connection with such plans), and student health insurance coverage arranged by eligible organizations that are institutions of higher education, that effectively exempt them from this requirement. The regulations establish a mechanism for separately furnishing payments for contraceptive services on behalf of participants and beneficiaries of the group health plans of eligible organizations that avail themselves of an accommodation, and enrollees and dependents of student health coverage arranged by eligible organizations that are institutions of higher education that avail themselves of an accommodation. These interim final regulations augment current regulations in light of the Supreme Court's interim order in connection with an application for an injunction in Wheaton College v. Burwell, 134 S. Ct. 2806 (2014) (Wheaton order). These interim final regulations provide an alternative process that an eligible organization may use to provide notice of its religious objections to providing contraceptive coverage, while preserving participants' and beneficiaries' (and enrollees' and dependents') access to coverage for the full range of Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved contraceptives, as prescribed by a health care provider, without cost sharing."

Reports indicate that this has expanded health coverage. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate coverage, access to care, and health care use among 19- to 25-year-olds compared with 26- to 34-year-olds following PPACA implementation. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Data from the Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System and the National Health Interview Survey, which provide nationally representative measures of coverage, access to care, and health care use, were used to conduct the study among participants aged 19 to 25 years (young adults) and 26 to 34 years (adults) in 2009 and 2012. EXPOSURE: Self-reported health insurance coverage. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Health status, presence of a usual source of care, and ability to afford medications, dental care, or physician visits. RESULTS: Health coverage increased between 2009 and 2012 for 19- to 25-year-olds (68.3% to 71.7%). Using a difference-in-differences (DID) approach, after adjustment, the likelihood of having a usual source of care decreased in both groups but more significantly for 26- to 34-year-olds (DID, 2.8%; 95%CI, 0.45 to 5.15). There was no significant change in health status for 19- to 25-year-olds compared with 26- to 34-year-olds (DID, -0.5%; 95%CI, -1.87 to 0.87). There was no significant change for 19- to 25-year-olds compared with 26- to 34-year-olds in the percentage who reported receiving a routine checkup in the past year (DID, 0.3%; 95%CI, -2.25 to 2.85) or in the ability to afford prescription medications (DID, -0.4%; 95%CI, -2.93 to 1.93), dental care (DID, -2.6%; 95%CI, -5.61 to 0.61), or physician visits (DID, -1.7%; 95%CI, -3.66 to 0.26). There was also no change in the percentage who reported receiving a flu shot (DID, 1.9; 95%CI, -1.93 to 4.93). Insured individuals were more likely to report having a usual source of care and a recent routine checkup and were more likely to be able to afford health care than uninsured individuals. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Implementation of the PPACA was associated with increased health insurance coverage for 19- to 25-year-olds without significant changes in perceived health care affordability or health status. Although the likelihood of having a usual source of care declined between 2009 and 2012 for all, this decrease was smaller among 19- to 25-year-olds, and younger adults were more likely than 26- to 34-year-olds to have a usual source of care.

Study Design: Health plan formulary review and analysis. Methods: We analyzed formularies from the 3 largest small group plans in California and Massachusetts, including each state's benchmark plan. With respect to both federal and state regulations, for each health plan, we examined whether the drug was covered, the designated patient cost sharing tier of the drug, and which conditions of reimbursement were applied to the drug. Results: Most drugs included in state and federal mandates are covered by both benchmark and non-benchmark plans. However, health plans are not fully compliant with state and federal regulations. Significant differences among plans relate more to cost sharing and conditions of reimbursement, such as prior authorization, step edits, and quantity limits, than to drug coverage. Conclusions/Policy Implications: Because health plans in California and Massachusetts are not fully compliant with state and federal mandates, they will have to adjust their formularies to meet minimum requirements. State policy makers need to balance competing aims of comprehensiveness of coverage and drug affordability. They must consider: (1) choice of benchmark plan - choice of a more generous benchmark plan implies less leverage for negotiating lower prices; and (2) breadth of state mandates which, if they exceed federal mandates, must be paid for by the states."

A key example of the difficulty of allocating decision making responsibility is the effort to define a minimum benefit package for insurance plans, called essential health benefits. While the ACA should achieve its goal of near-universal access to care, it leaves in place a multiplicity of processes and decision-makers for determining individual treatment. As a result, decisions about what care is provided are likely to remain, much as they are today, divided among government agencies, private insurers, private employers, and the courts. © 2014 Escola Nacional de Saúde Pública."

The purpose of this paper is to provide an update assessment of the financial conditions of US hospitals. This purpose is important given the timing of health reforms in the next fiscal year with greater volumes of lower reimbursement. Methods: Data are obtained from the CMS Hospital Cost Report Information System (""HCRIS"") data set published as of July 1, 2013. This analysis used only those cost reports with a 365 day fiscal year ending during 2011. This is the latest fiscal year for which data was available for all hospitals at this writing. For purposes of this analysis, hospitals were stratified by bed size and ownership type. There were 7 financials ratios selected on the basis of prior studies to measure profitability, capital structure, and liquidity. Results: In terms of profitability, acute-care hospitals showed a median total margin of 3.2% in 2011; investor owned organizations performed better, almost twice as good, with a median of 6.3% for multi-hospital system facilities and 5.6% for non-system facilities. Cash flow margins show similar patterns with a nationwide median of 7.2%. In terms of capital structure, hospitals exhibited a median debt to capitalization of 27.5% and a median cash flow to total debt of 14.3%. In terms of liquidity, days in receivables appear to show more subtle differences among the categories with a national median of 48.9 days. Discussion: System affiliation and size were the big drivers of financial performance in 2011. Investor owned system hospitals appeared to excel on the financial performance indicators here. Conclusions: System hospitals and economies of scale drove much of the relatively stronger profitability results in 2011. Stand-alone general service hospitals may seek out affiliations because of weaker margins during the upcoming period of greater volume with lower reimbursements during health reforms in 2014 and beyond."

Results showed that, estimating conservatively, about 1.2 million (21%) current VA users are LEME if all states implement the expansion. Homeless service users were twice as likely to be eligible than nonhomeless users (64% vs 30%). VA service users who are LEME, regardless of housing status, were physically healthier than those not LEME but were more likely to have substance use disorders and posttraumatic stress disorder.

METHODS:: To estimate changes in insurance rates, we employed a difference-in-difference regression approach comparing 7962 young adults aged 19-25 to 9321 adults aged 27-34. Separate regressions were estimated for non-Hispanic blacks, Hispanics, and non-Hispanic whites to understand whether the mandate had differential effects by race/ethnicity. Separate regressions by income level and race/ethnicity were also estimated. RESULTS:: Insurance rates increased by 9.3 percentage points among non-Hispanic whites, 7.2 percentage points among Hispanics, and 9.4 percentage points among non-Hispanic blacks. These changes were not significantly different from each other. Among individuals with income of <133% of the Federal Poverty Level, non-Hispanic whites experienced significantly larger gains, whereas at higher-income levels, non-Hispanic blacks experienced significantly larger gains than other racial/ethnic groups. CONCLUSIONS:: The dependent coverage mandate of the Affordable Care Act increased insurance rates among all racial and ethnic groups but did not change overall disparities. Disparities may have widened among low-income populations which highlights the importance of Medicaid expansions in reducing disparities.

In this article, we argue that the law's intergovernmental structure has amplified political conflict over its implementation by distributing governing authority to political actors at both levels of the American federal system. We review the ways in which the law's demands for institutional coordination between federal and state governments (and especially the role it preserves for governors and state legislatures) have created difficulties for rolling out health-insurance exchanges and expanding the Medicaid program. By way of contrast, we show how the institutional design of the ACA's regulatory reforms of the insurance market, which diminish the reform's political salience, has allowed for considerably less friction during the implementation process.

Under the Affordable Care Act, the impact of insuring this population on health care utilization is unclear. We examined insurance records from >3.5 million non-pregnancy-related primary care visits in the Military Health System to describe health care utilization patterns among 467 099 non-active duty patients, aged 12 to 22, with access to free health care. METHODS: We described association of age and gender with primary care utilization rates, clinic type, and primary and secondary diagnoses. RESULTS: Adolescents and young adults were seen for 2.63 primary care visits per year. Use of Pediatric Clinics declined with age (51.6% to 1.8%) and increased for Family Medicine (45.5% to 91.1%). The top 3 diagnostic groups in our study were health maintenance (18.3%), health evaluation (17.3%), and respiratory/ear, nose, and throat (15.1%). Age-by-gender interactions had a significant association with health care utilization rates and diagnoses at primary care appointments. For example, the percent of all appointments accounted for by musculoskeletal injuries increased significantly (P < .001) with age for males (10.6%, 12-14 years; 12.8%, 15-18 years; 15.2%, 19-22 years) and decreased for females (10.3%, 9.2%, 7.5%). CONCLUSIONS: Unlike previous studies of adolescents and young adults, we show that this population, especially female young adults, does use health care when it is available and largely free. Extrapolating from our Military Health System data, we expect implementation of the Affordable Care Act will result in an increased demand for health care, particularly in the areas of reproductive health care, respiratory/ear, nose, and throat issues, and routine health maintenance."

Findings reveal physicians are highly responsive to fee generosity under both programs. Also, their willingness to accept patients under either program is affected by the generosity of fees under the other program, i.e., there are significant spillover effects between Medicare and Medicare fee generosity. We also simulate how physicians in 2008 would have likely responded to Medicaid and Medicare payment reforms similar to those embodied in the 2010 Affordable Care Act, had they been permanently in place in 2008. Our findings suggest that “Medicaid Parity” for primary care physicians would have likely dramatically improved physician willingness to accept new Medicaid patients while only slightly reducing their willingness to accept new Medicare patients.

Studies have shown that this provision increased coverage rates among young adults. In this article we analyze whether the provision also protected young adults from large and uncertain out-of-pocket expenses. We found that the policy was associated with a statistically significant reduction in the share of young adults facing annual out-of-pocket expenditures greater than $1,500 (decreasing from 4.2 percent to 2.9 percent), compared to an increase in the proportion of their slightly older peers facing such expenditures (increasing from 4.4 percent to 5.4 percent), a net difference of -2.4 percentage points, or 57 percent. We conclude that the dependent coverage provision in the ACA provides financial protection for young adults at a time when they often face high debt burden but low wages. © 2014 by Project HOPE - The People-to-People Health Foundation."

Improved group coverage allows adults with disabilities to retain Medicaid coverage even once they lose disability status due to medical improvement, as long as they retain the original medical impairment. The goal of this paper is to describe who participated, the patterns of their participation, and employment outcomes.METHODS: The study population consists of all individuals (n = 315) who participated in medically improved group coverage 2002-2009 in the seven states with coverage by 2009 (Arizona, Connecticut, Kansas, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia). Linked data from state Medicaid Buy-In finder files and Social Security Administration Ticket Research and Master Earnings Files were used to describe improved group participants and their patterns of enrollment.RESULTS: Although enrollment has been limited, with 255 participants in 2009, it has doubled annually on average with little churning and drop-out. Participants' earnings grew nearly 200 dollars per month after two years, likely reflecting increased work hours and/or higher pay rates.CONCLUSIONS: Improved group participants represent an unusually successful group of individuals with disabilities, many of whom have recently moved off Social Security cash benefit rolls or who were diverted from them. Specifics of insurance eligibility and coverage for improved group participants are uncertain under the Affordable Care Act. The challenge remains to provide a pathway for adults with disabilities to increase work and assets without loss of adequate health insurance."

We examined the trends in health care affordability over the past decade, measuring the financial burdens associated with health insurance premiums and out-of-pocket costs and highlighting implications of the Affordable Care Act for the future financial burdens of particular populations. Methods We used cross sections of the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey Household Component (MEPS-HC) from 2001 to 2009. We defined financial burden at the health insurance unit (HIU) level and calculated it as the ratio of expenditures on health care - employer-sponsored insurance coverage (ESI) and private nongroup premiums and out-of-pocket payments - to modified adjusted gross income. Findings The median health care financial burden grew on average by 2.7% annually and by 21.9% over the period. Using a range of definitions, the fraction of households facing high financial burdens increased significantly. For example, the share of HIUs with health care expenses exceeding 10% of income increased from 35.9% to 44.8%, a 24.8% relative increase. The share of the population in HIUs with health care financial burdens between 2% and 10% fell, and the share with burdens between 10% and 44% rose. Conclusions We found a clear trend over the past decade toward an increasing share of household income devoted to health care. The ACA will affect health care spending for subgroups of the population differently. Several groups' burdens will likely decrease, including those becoming eligible for Medicaid or subsidized private insurance and those with expensive medical conditions. Those newly obtaining coverage might increase their health spending relative to income, but they will gain access to care and the ability to spread their expenditures over time, both of which have demonstrable economic value. © 2014 Milbank Memorial Fund."

We evaluated whether having health insurance reduces racial disparities in the use of definitive therapy for high-risk CaP. Materials and methods: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program was used to identify 70,006 men with localized high-risk CaP (prostate-specific antigen level >20. ng/ml or Gleason score 8-10 or stage>cT3a) diagnosed from 2007 to 2010. We used multivariable logistic regression to analyze the 64,277 patients with complete data to determine the factors associated with receipt of definitive therapy. Results: Compared with white men, African American (AA) men were significantly less likely to receive definitive treatment (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.60; 95% CI: 0.56-0.64; P<0.001) after adjusting for sociodemographics and known CaP prognostic factors. There was a significant interaction between race and insurance status (P<inf>interaction</inf> = 0.01) such that insurance coverage was associated with a reduction in racial disparity between AA and white patients regarding receipt of definitive therapy. Specifically, the AOR for definitive treatment for AA vs. white was 0.38 (95% CI: 0.27-0.54, P<0.001) among uninsured men, whereas the AOR was 0.62 (95% CI: 0.57-0.66, P<0.001) among insured men. Conclusions: AA men with high-risk CaP were significantly less likely to receive potentially life-saving definitive treatment when compared with white men. Having health insurance was associated with a reduction in this racial treatment disparity, suggesting that expansion of health insurance coverage may help reduce racial disparities in the management of aggressive cancers. © 2014 Elsevier Inc."

The methodology for this study was a literature review. Research was conducted using a scholarly online database search and government Web sites. The number of individuals charged with criminal fraud increased from 797 cases in fiscal year 2008 to 1430 cases in fiscal year 2011 - an increase of more than 75%. According to 2010 data, of the 7848 subjects investigated for criminal fraud, 25% were medical facilities, and 16% were medical equipment suppliers. In 2009 and 2010, the Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control Program recovered approximately $25.2 million of taxpayers' money. Educating providers about the policies and laws designed to prevent fraud would help them to become partners. Many new programs and partnerships with government agencies have also been developed to combat Medicare fraud. Medicare fraud has been a persistent crime, and laws and policies alone have not been enough to control the problem.

First, any major policy innovation is an experiment. There will be hypotheses and expectations, but until implemented and tested, we cannot be certain of the results-so we need to collect data on the impact of innovations so that the nation learns from the challenges of doing such experiments. In addition to being an experiment itself, the ACA has strengthened the role of research in improving the quality, effectiveness, and value of health care. By creating the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) Innovation Center and the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI), the ACA has put research at the center of American healthcare improvement. Now, with the many improvements the ACA makes in American healthcare financing and delivery, and the important research it supports, there is the opportunity that all health policymakers and researchers long for, and on which the public depends, to have real impact on health. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014."

Starting in 2014, states can elect to cover individuals and families with modified adjusted gross incomes below a threshold of 133 percent of federal poverty guidelines, with a 5 percent income disregard. We used simulation methods and data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey to compare nondisabled adults enrolled in Medicaid prior to the ACA with two other groups: adults who were eligible for Medicaid but not enrolled in it, and adults who were in the income range for the ACA's Medicaid expansion and thus newly eligible for coverage. Although differences in health across the groups were not large, both the newly eligible and those eligible before the ACA but not enrolled were healthier on several measures than pre-ACA enrollees. Twenty-five states have opted not to use the ACA to expand Medicaid eligibility. If these states reverse their decisions, their Medicaid programs might not enroll a population that is sicker than their pre-ACA enrollees. By expanding Medicaid eligibility, states could provide coverage to millions of healthier adults as well as to millions who have chronic conditions and who need care. © 2014 Project HOPE-The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc."

These multiple attempts toward national health care reform invoke the inquiry of the federal government's role and function to facilitate access to and management of health care.

We then estimated the effect the Affordable Care Act (ACA) will have on the future profitability of providing ED care. We estimated that hospital revenue from ED care exceeded costs for that care by $6.1 billion in 2009, representing a profit margin of 7.8 percent (net revenue expressed as a percentage of total revenue). However, this is primarily because hospitals make enough profit on the privately insured ($17 billion) to cover underpayment from all other payer groups, such as Medicare, Medicaid, and unreimbursed care. Assuming current payer reimbursement rates, ACA reforms could result in an additional 4.4-percentage-point increase in profit margins for hospital-based EDs compared to what could be the case without the reforms. © 2014 Project HOPE-The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc."

While much has been debated about ACA, relatively few studies have focused on how ACA will impact on physicians' practice behavior. Design/methodology/approach: The research data came from a mailed survey of ninety physicians randomly selected from the Cigna Directory of Physicians practicing in Ohio. Study examined how informed were physicians about ACA, and explored how much the effect of ACA has been discussed in their practice, how they think ACA will impact their practice, and whether or not they are in favor of the provisions under the Act. Findings: Overwhelmingly, while the physicians surveyed were familiar with the specific provisions of ACA, almost half of them opposed it. Primary care physicians reported generally favorable opinions about ACA. All but one of the physicians concluded that ACA, much like managed care provisions, has undermined and will continue to reduce the autonomy and professional independence of physicians. Research limitations/implications: This study is limited by its small sample and reliance on a small set of physicians. Practical implications: This study has practical implications for examining how Ohio physicians are responding to the new health care reform in the United States. It has broader implications for addressing the problem of the uninsured and the role of the federal government in health care provision. Social implications: If physicians are opposed to this reform as the study seems to suggest, it might have broader implications for future career aspirations for physicians. Originality/value: So far as we can tell, there has not been any exploratory study in Ohio examining the perspectives of physicians on ACA. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

I focus on the individual health insurance market, which includes plans purchased through exchanges as well as plans purchased directly from insurers. In this market, at least 13.2 million people were covered in the second quarter of 2014, representing an increase of at least 4.2 million beyond pre-ACA state-level trends. I use data on coverage, premiums, and costs and a model developed by Martin Hackmann, Jonathan Kolstad, and myself (forthcoming) to calculate changes in selection and markups, which allow me to estimate the welfare impact of the ACA on participants in the individual health insurance market in each state. I then focus on comparisons across groups of states. The estimates from my model imply that market participants in the five “direct enforcement” states—those that ceded all enforcement of the ACA to the federal government—are experiencing welfare losses of approximately $245 per participant on an annualized basis, relative to participants in all other states. The estimates also imply that the impact of setting up a state exchange depends meaningfully on how well the exchange functions. Market participants in the six states that had severe exchange glitches are experiencing welfare losses of approximately $750 per participant on an annualized basis, relative to participants in other states with their own exchanges. Although the national impact of the ACA is likely to change over the course of 2014 as coverage, costs, and premiums evolve, I expect that the differential impacts that are observed across states will persist through the rest of 2014. © 2015, Brookings Institution Press.

When trying to determine what services are covered, an individual may have to wade through multiple plan documents and interpret unfamiliar language. Even if a consumer does make such an effort, they may be unable to really understand the terms of their coverage. In an attempt to make insurance a little more understandable, Congress created the Uniform Glossary in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010. This document contains approximately two dozen commonly used insurance terms with easy-to-under-stand definitions. Every enrollee will receive the Uniform Glossary along with official plan documents, but the terms and definitions are not plan-specific and are not legally binding. Therefore, any given definition in the Uniform Glossary could be entirely different from the actual definition used by the insurer. This Note proposes that the Uniform Glossary provision is ineffective in its current state, particularly as it relates to employer-sponsored insurance. Although Congress explicitly intended the Uniform Glossary to be an informational tool and not binding on the terms of coverage, its intent will be meaningless if consumers cannot rely on those definitions to understand their health insurance coverage. In order to create a truly accessible marketplace, Congress must require insurance plans to use the terms as defined in the Uniform Glossary in all plan documents. This will put consumers in a position to adequately assess the terms of their insurance coverage, to make better-informed purchasing decisions when seeking medical treatment, and to participate in a more efficient and transparent marketplace."

Since the state of Vermont has a history of insurance reforms that mimic the ACA (and dually has an ultimate goal of single payer health insurance coverage), there is a unique opportunity for evaluating similar state and ACA goals. As far back as 1991, the state legislature passed guaranteed issue and community rating so that insurance carriers could not deny coverage to customers or charge discriminatory rates based on demographic and heath status factors. And, like Massachusetts, Vermont has used its Medicaid program creatively to cover as much of their population as possible. An all-payer claims dataset has been in place for 5 years in Vermont. Medicaid has recently been integrated into the dataset and Medicare will soon be. This will be a rich source of claims data for analysis and planning going forward, but will require much work to make it useful to multiple parties. Beginning in 2014 small-group and non-group markets will be required to purchase insurance through a state exchange. Vermont is the only state to require that all purchasing for small-group and individual coverage occur through the Exchange. Vermont is also the only states to locate its Exchange within a state Medicaid agency. The reason for this is a desire on the part of state policy makers to ensure enrollment in coverage and transitions between coverage. Between private and public insurance are as seamless as possible. Because there are programs such as these in place to improve data collection, activities much consideration has been made about what questions to ask of the data. Unfortunately, there is not a strong national data collection framework in place that can guide Vermont and the other states. Even though there will be much state variation in implementing the ACA, data collection strategies must be coordinated, and standard measures must be set by the federal government. We can look to early pioneers in Vermont, Massachusetts, and elsewhere for early lessons learned. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014."

Methods We conducted a secondary analysis of data (2005 to 2010) from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. We specified multiple linear regression models to examine differences in the payments, charges, and reimbursement ratios by insurance category. Comparisons were made between 2 groups to reflect likely movements in insurance status after the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act implementation: (1) the uninsured who will be Medicaid eligible afterward versus Medicaid insured, and (2) the uninsured who will be Medicaid ineligible afterward versus the privately insured. Results From 2005 to 2010, as a percentage of total ED charges, outpatient ED encounters for Medicaid beneficiaries reimbursed 17% more than for uninsured individuals who will become Medicaid eligible after Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act implementation: 40.0% versus 34.0%, mean absolute difference=5.9%, 95% confidence interval 5.7% to 6.2%. During the same period, the privately insured reimbursed 39% more than for uninsured individuals who will not be Medicaid eligible after Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act implementation: 54.0% versus 38.8%, mean absolute difference=15.2%, 95% confidence interval 12.8% to 17.6%. Conclusion Assuming historical reimbursement patterns remain after Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act implementation, outpatient ED encounters could reimburse considerably more for both the previously uninsured patients who will obtain Medicaid insurance and for those who move into private insurance products through health insurance exchanges. Although our study does provide insight into the future, multiple factors will ultimately influence reimbursements after implementation of the act.© 2013 by the American College of Emergency Physicians."

The Boston Area Community Health survey collected data before (2002-2005) and after (2006-2010) introduction of the MA health insurance mandate, providing a unique opportunity to assess its effects in a large, epidemiologic cohort. Methods: We report on the apparent effects of the mandate on the same participants over time, focusing specifically on the vulnerable working poor (WP). We evaluated differences in subpopulations of interest at pre- and post-reform periods to explore whether MA health care reform resulted in an overall gain in insurance coverage. Results: MA health care reform was associated with net gains in health insurance coverage overall and among the subgroups studied. Our findings suggest that despite being targeted by health care reform legislation, the WP in MA continue to report lower rates of insurance coverage compared with both the nonworking poor and the not poor. Conclusions: MA health care reform legislation, including the expansion of Medicaid, resulted in substantial overall gains in coverage. Disparities in insurance coverage persist among some subgroups following health care reform implementation in MA.

The literature was reviewed and is critically discussed. The social history of alcohol policies over the last 75 years began with the scientific approach to alcohol in the 1930s and later shifted to a central interest in the disease of alcoholism. Beginning with the National Council on Alcoholism Education, advocates struggled to ""mainstream"" treatment for this disease into the health care system. Major steps included decriminalization of public intoxication, emphasis of the social respectability of persons with alcohol problems, development of a treatment system that was accompanied by health insurance coverage, and work-based programs to identify and attract employed patients with health insurance coverage. These structures were considerably altered by the War on Drugs, managed care, and the merger of drug and alcohol treatment. The Affordable Care Act, however, has the potential for achieving the mainstreaming goals for alcohol problems originally conceived in the early 1940s. Responsible involvement of the alcoholic beverage industry could greatly enhance current activities but is not likely to occur. Stigma persists in part because of associations with prevention and treatment of illegal drug use problems.

Socioeconomic status, acculturation, and health access significantly accounted for an association between ethnicity and SRH. However, the magnitudes of their effects on SRH varied across the groups and by the factors examined.

This suggests that the recent decline is not primarily the result of structural changes in the health sector or of components of the Affordable Care Act, and that-absent other changes in the health care system-an economic recovery will result in increased health spending. © 2014 by Project HOPE - The People-to-People Health Foundation."

The issue divided the United States then, and it divides the nation today. This essay examines 2000-2013 press coverage of contraception in the New York Times and the Los Angeles Times, two newspapers that have covered contraception since 1873. Press coverage reveals that contemporary efforts to regulate women's bodies are cloaked in discussions about the Affordable Care Act, religious freedom, morality, and employer rights. Accepting the ideology that contraception is no longer a reproductive rights issue allowed the press to exclude women from the debate. In doing so, the power of political, social, and religious groups to control the contraception narrative and women's lives is confirmed. The lived experience of women has evolved from 1873 when press coverage at least gave women a platform to speak about contraception. By 2013, this power appears to be lost. © SAGE Publications."

It is unknown whether major changes in population insurance coverage can affect readmission rates, despite the Affordable Care Act's coverage expansions coming into effect this year. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of a large-scale insurance expansion on hospital readmissions, using Massachusetts' 2006 health reform as a natural experiment. DESIGN: Difference-in-difference time-series design. SETTING: All Massachusetts acute-care hospitals. PATIENTS: Inpatient visits from 2004 to 2010. MEASUREMENTS: Primary outcome was the hospital 30-day readmission rate. Readmissions to any Massachusetts hospital were tracked. RESULTS: Decreases in uninsurance rates during and after reform were largely limited to the hospital quartile with the highest prereform uninsurance rates (from 14% uninsured at the start of the reform to 2.9% by the end of the study period). The other hospitals collectively experienced a smaller decline in their uninsured admissions (5.9% at the start of reform to 2.5% by the end of the study period). According to difference-in-difference regression analysis, the highest uninsured hospital quartile experienced a modest increase in their unadjusted readmission rate of 0.6 percentage points (95% confidence interval: 0.1%-1.1%) during the reform period as compared to the other hospital quartiles (P=0.01). This represents a relative increase of 4.5% in the readmission rate. Risk-adjusted readmission rates showed no corresponding change. CONCLUSIONS: The Affordable Care Act's insurance expansion may be associated with an increase in unadjusted readmission rates among hospitals that cared for disproportionate numbers of uninsured patients. Risk-adjustment appears to take this effect into account. © 2014 Society of Hospital Medicine."

The diffusion of new knowledge about pros and cons of ACO is essential to reinforce the health care reform in the United States. Copyright © 2014 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited.Purpose - The implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act has facilitated the development of an innovative and integrated delivery care system, Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs). It is timely, to identify how health care managers in rural health clinics (RHCs) are responding to the ACO model. This research examines RHC managers' perceived benefits and barriers for implementing ACOs from an organizational ecology perspective.Methodology/approach - A survey was conducted in spring of 2012 covering the present RHC network working infrastructures - (1) Organizational social network; (2) organizational care delivery structure; (3) ACO knowledge, perceived benefits, and perceived barriers; (4) quality and disease management programs; and (5) health information technology (HIT) infrastructure. One thousand one hundred sixty clinics were surveyed in the United States. They cover eight southeastern states (Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee) and California. A total of 91 responses were received.Findings - RHC managers' personal perceptions on ACO's benefits and knowledge level explained the most variance in their willingness to join ACOs. Individual perceptions appear to be more influential than organizational and context factors in the predictive analysis.Research limitations/implications - The study is primarily focused in the Southeastern region of the United States. The generalizability is limited to this region. The predictors of RHCs' participation in ACOs are germane to guide the development of organizational strategies for enhancing the general knowledge about the innovativeness of delivering coordinated care and containing health care costs inspired by the Affordable Care Act."

Enacted as Title XXI of the Social Security Act, the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP; or SCHIP as it has been known at some points) provided states with federal assistance to create programs specifically designed for children from families with incomes that exceeded Medicaid thresholds but that were insufficient to enable them to afford private health insurance. Congress provided $40 billion in block grants over 10 years for states to expand their existing Medicaid programs to cover the intended populations, to erect new stand-alone SCHIP programs for these children, or to effect some combination of both options. Congress reauthorized CHIP once in 2009 under the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act and extended its life further within provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010. The purpose of this statement is to review the features of CHIP as it has evolved over the 16 years of its existence; to summarize what is known about the effects that the program has had on coverage, access, health status, and disparities among participants; to identify challenges that remain with respect to insuring this group of vulnerable children, including the impact that provisions of the new Affordable Care Act will have on the issue of health insurance coverage for near-poor children after 2015; and to offer recommendations on how to expand and strengthen the national commitment to provide health insurance to all children regardless of means.

Some of these changes implement certain statutory provisions contained in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively known as the Affordable Care Act), the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, and other legislation. These changes are applicable to discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2014, unless otherwise specified in this final rule. We also are updating the rate-of-increase limits for certain hospitals excluded from the IPPS that are paid on a reasonable cost basis subject to these limits. The updated rate-of-increase limits are effective for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2014. We also are updating the payment policies and the annual payment rates for the Medicare prospective payment system (PPS) for inpatient hospital services provided by long-term care hospitals (LTCHs) and implementing certain statutory changes to the LTCH PPS under the Affordable Care Act and the Pathway for Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) Reform Act of 2013 and the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014. In addition, we discuss our proposals on the interruption of stay policy for LTCHs and on retiring the ""5 percent"" payment adjustment for collocated LTCHs. While many of the statutory mandates of the Pathway for SGR Reform Act apply to discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2014, others will not begin to apply until 2016 and beyond. In addition, we are making a number of changes relating to direct graduate medical education (GME) and indirect medical education (IME) payments. We are establishing new requirements or revising requirements for quality reporting by specific providers (acute care hospitals, PPS-exempt cancer hospitals, and LTCHs) that are participating in Medicare. We are updating policies relating to the Hospital Value-Based Purchasing (VBP) Program, the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program, and the Hospital-Acquired Condition (HAC) Reduction Program. In addition, we are making technical corrections to the regulations governing provider administrative appeals and judicial review; updating the reasonable compensation equivalent (RCE) limits, and revising the methodology for determining such limits, for services furnished by physicians to certain teaching hospitals and hospitals excluded from the IPPS; making regulatory revisions to broaden the specified uses of Medicare Advantage (MA) risk adjustment data and to specify the conditions for release of such risk adjustment data to entities outside of CMS; and making changes to the enforcement procedures for organ transplant centers.

OBJECTIVE To estimate the differential effect of insurance expansion on utilization of discretionary vs nondiscretionary inpatient surgery with Massachusetts health care reform as a natural experimental condition. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We used the state inpatient databases from Massachusetts and 2 control states (New Jersey and New York) to identify nonelderly adult patients (aged 19-64 years) who underwent discretionary vs nondiscretionary surgical procedures from January 1, 2003, through December 31, 2010. We defined discretionary surgery as elective, preference-sensitive procedures (eg, joint replacement and back surgery) and nondiscretionary surgery as imperative and potentially life-saving procedures (eg, cancer surgery and hip fracture repair). EXPOSURE All surgical procedures in the study and control populations. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Using July 1, 2007, as the transition point between the prereform and postreform periods, we performed a difference-in-differences analysis to estimate the effect of insurance expansion on rates of discretionary and nondiscretionary surgical procedures in the entire study population and for subgroups defined by race, income, and insurance status.We then extrapolated our results from Massachusetts to the entire US population. RESULTS We identified a total of 836 311 surgical procedures during the study period. Insurance expansion was associated with a 9.3% increase in the use of discretionary surgery in Massachusetts (P = .02). Conversely, the rate of nondiscretionary surgery decreased by 4.5%(P = .009).We found similar effects for discretionary surgery in all subgroups, with the greatest increase observed for nonwhite participants (19.9%[P < .001]). Based on the findings in Massachusetts, we estimated that full implementation of national insurance expansion would yield an additional 465 934 discretionary surgical procedures by 2017. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Insurance expansion in Massachusetts was associated with increased rates of discretionary surgery and a concurrent decrease in rates of nondiscretionary surgery. If similar changes are seen nationally under the Affordable Care Act, the value of insurance expansion for surgical care may depend on the relative balance between increased expenditures and potential health benefits of greater access to elective inpatient procedures.

Setting: Physician-owned, private family practice office. Practice innovation: Pharmacist-delivered MWV. Main outcome measures: Patient visits and practice income. Results: Because of time constraints in the practice, physicians, nurse practitioners, and a physician assistant had been unable to offer MWVs, a new service available to Medicare beneficiaries under the Affordable Care Act. A pharmacist who was previously providing patient care services 1 day/week at a fixed hourly rate was able to add an additional 1 day/week for provision of MWVs. These visits involve updating medical and medication histories; measuring weight, mass, and blood pressure; assessing cognitive and physical function; and screening the patient and recommending preventive services. From September 2012 to February 2013, 174 patients participated in the pharmacist-delivered MWV. Pharmacist visits were billed using codes G0438 and G0439, and the practice realized a positive net income for the MWVs. Conclusion: Pharmacist-delivered MWVs are financially viable and allow for greater pharmacist participation on the primary care team."

Private entities are merging, aligning, and coordinating in a wide array of configurations. At the same time, there is a great deal of policy change. This includes the federal government's Affordable Care Act, as well as actions by Medicare, state legislatures, and state agencies. The health system is built upon markets, which determine how (and how well) goods and services are delivered to consumers, so it is critical that these markets work as well as possible. As the primary federal antitrust enforcement agencies, the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice are charged with ensuring that health care markets operate well, but they are not alone. The functioning of health care markets is also profoundly affected by other parts of the federal government (notably the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services) and by state legislation and regulation.

Nearly 80 percent of our sample in all three states favored Medicaid expansion, and approximately two-thirds of uninsured respondents said that they planned to apply for either Medicaid or subsidized private coverage in 2014. Yet awareness of their state's actual expansion plans was low. Most viewed having Medicaid as better than being uninsured and at least as good as private insurance in overall quality and affordability.While the debate over Medicaid expansion continues, support for expansion is strong among low-income adults, and the perceived quality of Medicaid coverage is high. © 2014 Project HOPE-The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc."

This is known as the ""welfare magnet"" hypothesis, a claim that geographic variation in social programs induces the migration of welfare recipients to places with more generous benefits or eligibility. To investigate whether such spillover effects are likely, we used data from the Current Population Survey to examine the migration patterns of lowincome people before and after recent expansions of public insurance in Arizona, Maine, Massachusetts, and New York. Using difference-indifferences analysis of migration in expansion and control states, we found no evidence of significant migration effects. Our preferred estimate was precise enough to rule out net migration effects of larger than 1,600 people per year in an expansion state.

The present limitations of evidence, often a consequence of delays and inconsistencies in the law's implementation, have begun to affect policy making in the ACA's wake.

We describe the difficulties state Medicaid programs have experienced in implementing the fee bump, as well as howthe resulting evidence gap and the broader political context have shaped the deliberations.

These recommendations affect the cost of medical care. Yet neither organization explicitly incorporates measures of efficiency or cost-effectiveness in making its recommendations. To redress this shortcoming, we propose a decisionmaking framework for these two organizations based on the principles of economic efficiency. Our analysis suggests that routine use of a preventive service should be recommended for full insurance coverage if the service's cost-effectiveness exceeds a socially determined threshold. For less costeffective services, we suggest that information about effectiveness and cost should be provided to consumers by physicians or government, but the choice of care and insurance coverage for care should be made by individuals. For the least cost-effective services, the two organizations should discourage public and private insurers from covering such services and report their unfavorable cost-effectiveness. © 2014 Project HOPE-The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc."

A growing concern among health policy experts is that new Medicare policies designed to improve the quality and efficiency of hospital care, such as value-based purchasing (VBP), the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP), and electronic health record (EHR) meaningful-use criteria, will disproportionately affect safety-net hospitals, which are already facing reduced disproportionate-share hospital (DSH) payments under both Medicare and Medicaid. We examined hospitals in California to determine whether safety-net institutions were more likely than others to incur penalties under these programs. To assess quality, we also examined whether mortality outcomes were different at these hospitals. Our study found that compared to non-safety-net hospitals, safety-net institutions had lower thirty-day risk-adjusted mortality rates in the period 2009-11 for acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, and pneumonia and marginally lower adjusted Medicare costs. Nonetheless, safety-net hospitals were more likely than others to be penalized under the VBP program and the HRRP and more likely not to meet EHR meaningful-use criteria.

Genetics accounts for some of this relationship, but much of it can be traced to environment and behavior, and the environmental and behavioral risk factors for poor health disproportionately affect families living in poverty. Unhealthy children are likely to become unhealthy adults, and poor health drags down both their educational attainment and their income. Because of the close connection between parents' and children's health, write Sherry Glied and Don Oellerich, we have every reason to believe that programs to improve parents' health will improve their children's health as well. Yet few programs aim to work this way, except for a narrow category of programs that target pregnant women, newborns, and very young children. Glied and Oellerich assess these programs, discuss why there are so few of them, and suggest ways to expand them. Their chief conclusion is that structural barriers in the U.S. healthcare system stand in the way of such programs. Some of these barriers have to do with health insurance, access to care, and benefits, but the biggest one is the fact that physicians typically specialize in treating either children or adults, rather than families as a whole. The Affordable Care Act has begun to break down some of these barriers, the authors write, but much remains to be done."

Currently, this value only considers ""excess"" readmissions for myocardial infarction, heart failure, and pneumonia with a maximum fine being one per cent of total Medicare reimbursements. In 2015, this penalty will increase to three per cent and encompass more surgical diagnoses. We retrospectively reviewed a database of adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery treated at our institution in 2012 to establish whether patients with readmissions within 30 days of the index operation could have been managed more cost-effectively without readmission. A calculation of cost efficiency was performed to compare the net hospital profit for two scenarios: admitting patients versus hypothetical preventative measures. Of the 576 patients during the study period, a total of 68 (11.8%) patients with unplanned 30-day readmissions were identified. Outpatient management was determined to have been feasible for 18 (26.5%) patients. Whereas the calculated net profit for readmission was $144,000, inclusion of Medicare's penalty resulted in a loss of $11,950. A readmission reduction program with an annual cost exceeding $11,950 would lead to financial loss. The financial implications of Medicare's readmission penalty alone necessitate the development of cost-effective strategies to reduce rehospitalization. © 2014, Southeastern Surgical Congress.

Medicare reimbursement for physician services has been declining even as the number of Medicare enrollees has been increasing. The number of Medicare participants will only continue to grow as the American population ages and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act goes into effect. Efforts to increase reimbursement for physician services through Medicare are often met with data showing that most neurosurgeons continue to participate in the program despite these cutbacks. To better understand this dichotomy, practicing neurosurgeons were surveyed to gauge their response to cutbacks in the Medicare program beyond just their participation status. Methods. An Internet-based survey invitation was emailed to 3469 practicing neurosurgeons. Reminder emails were sent at intervals over several weeks to help increase the response rate. Results. Among respondents, an overwhelming percentage (96.8%) participated in Medicare. The neurosurgeons indicated that about one-third of their patient population was covered by Medicare. They also reported limiting the number of Medicare patients they see through a variety of mechanisms: only seeing Medicare patients with a specific diagnosis or from certain referring physicians or limiting the number of appointment slots for Medicare patients. Many respondents stated that further declines in Medicare reimbursement would lead to a reduction in their participation. Conclusions. While most responding neurosurgeons do participate in the Medicare program, a substantial proportion modulates their participation through a variety of mechanisms. These barriers to care access for Medicare patients are only expected to become greater if further declines in reimbursement are implemented through the program. © AANS, 2014."

The DSH payment cuts were predicated on the expectation that the ACA's expansion of health insurance to millions of Americans would bring about a decline in many hospitals' uncompensated care costs. However, the decision of twenty-five states not to expand their Medicaid programs, combined with residual coverage gaps, may leave as many as thirty million people uninsured, and hospitals will bear the burden of their uncompensated care costs.

The Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 linked many HDHPs with tax-advantaged spending accounts. The 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act continues to provide for HDHPs in its lowerlevel plans on the health insurance marketplace and provides for them in employer-offered plans. HDHPs decrease the premium cost of insurance policies for purchasers and shift the risk of further payments to the individual subscriber. HDHPs reduce utilization and total medical costs, at least in the short term. Because HDHPs require out-of-pocket payment in the initial stages of care, primary care and other outpatient services as well as elective procedures are the services most affected, whereas higher-cost services in the health care system, incurred after the deductible is met, are unaffected. HDHPs promote adverse selection because healthier and wealthier patients tend to opt out of conventional plans in favor of HDHPs. Because the ill pay more than the healthy under HDHPs, families with children with special health care needs bear an increased cost burden in this model.

For this integration to occur in the substance abuse treatment field, substantial sharing and dissemination of information by treatment providers is required. This study explored the determinants of organizational activities directed at disseminating evidence-based practices (EBPs) undertaken by 193 community treatment programs who are members of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Clinical Trials Network. Using factor analysis, the research identified two generic categories reflecting different motivations for dissemination activities and explored both treatment center leadership and organizational characteristics as determinants of these different types of dissemination activities. Organizational characteristics predicting treatment center dissemination activities included size, previous involvement in research protocols, linkages with other providers, and having non-profit status. The treatment center leader’s membership in professional organizations was also a significant determinant. Organization variables account for a larger portion of the variance in treatment center dissemination activities. The results suggest that the willingness of treatment providers to help disseminate EBPs within the industry may be heavily influenced through shared network connections with other treatment organizations. © 2014, National Council for Behavioral Health."

The United States Preventive Services Task Force has recommended screening, triggering coverage of low-dose CT by private health insurers under provisions of the Affordable Care Act. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) are currently evaluating coverage of lung cancer screening for Medicare beneficiaries. Since 70%of lung cancer occurs in patients 65 years or older, CMS should cover low-dose CT, thus avoiding the situation of at-risk patients being screened up to age 64 through private insurers and then abruptly ceasing screening at exactly the ages when their risk for developing lung cancer is increasing. Legitimate concerns include false-positive findings that lead to further testing and invasive procedures, overdiagnosis (detection of clinically unimportant cancers), the morbidity and mortality of surgery, and the overall costs of follow-up tests and procedures. These concerns can be mitigated by clear criteria for screening high-risk patients, disciplined management of abnormalities based on algorithms, and high-quality multidisciplinary care. Lung cancer screening with low-dose CT can lead to early diagnosis and cure for thousands of patients each year.

Thus, the socially vulnerable patients with complex conditions represent less profit-lower-to-negative Medicare margins-for home health agencies.

Few studies have drawn on longitudinal data to examine the organizational characteristics associated with programs transitioning from not delivering any pharmacotherapy to adopting at least one SUD medication. Method: Using two waves of panel longitudinal data collected over a 5-year period, we measured the transition to medication adoption in a cohort of 190 publicly funded treatment organizations that offered no SUD medications at baseline. Independent variables included organizational characteristics, medical resources, funding, treatment culture, and detailing activities by pharmaceutical companies. Results: Of 190 programs not offering SUD pharmacotherapy at baseline, 22.6% transitioned to offering at least one SUD medication at follow-up approximately 5 years later. Multivariate logistic regression results indicated that the employment of at least one physician at baseline, having a greater proportion of Medicaid clients, and pharmaceutical detailing were positively associated with medication adoption. Conclusions: Adoption of pharmacotherapy was more likely in programs that had greater medical resources, Medicaid funding, and contact with pharmaceutical companies.

One major concern about the Medicaid expansion is that a high level of need among the newly eligible may lead to runaway costs, which could overwhelm state budgets when federal subsidies no longer cover 100 percent of the expansion population's costs in 2017. Although cost increases as a result of the newly eligible are likely, an even more important question is whether these increases will be temporary or permanent. Evidence from California's Low Income Health Program (LIHP) suggests that cost and utilization increases among newly eligible Medicaid beneficiaries will be mostly temporary. This policy brief presents data showing a significant decline in the use of hospital inpatient care and in emergency room visits after one year of enrollment in LIHP, and a stable, not increasing, rate of outpatient service use. Because LIHP provided health care coverage from 2011 to 2013 in advance of the full Medicaid expansion, our findings suggest that early and significant investments in infrastructure and in improving the process of care delivery can effectively address the pent-up demand for health care services of previously uninsured populations."

The availability of new financial resources through the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is accompanied by raised expectations for such accountability. While state agencies often contract with universities on an ad hoc basis for specific policy projects, fourteen states have established formal stateuniversity partnerships so that their analytic and technical needs can be addressed more readily. After a brief overview of these partnerships, this article provides examples of their projects, which most often affect Medicaid policy, including work on program eligibility, provider payments, and optional benefits. State-university partnerships are working on policy-relevant projects that influence decision making. Like the variation in Medicaid programs across the country, no two partnerships are alike. They thrive in a mix of structures, using different means of contracting, and with varied degrees of data access.

This proportion far exceeds the most optimistic coverage projections for adults under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The child health insurance safety net was crafted from 1982 to 1997 through several incremental, bipartisan federal and state legislative actions. It began by offering and later mandating state Medicaid eligibility expansions and culminated with the enactment of the State Child Health Insurance Program. Two-thirds of the states leveraged these laws to expand coverage beyond federal requirements. As a senior executive with the American Academy of Pediatrics, the author was directly involved or closely monitored these federal and state child health insurance expansions. This case study is a participant-observer analysis of that period, an era that stands in stark contrast to today's highly partisan times. The successive expansions of publicly funded children's health insurance during this conservative period, when many other human services programs were slashed, are attributed to public sympathy for children, political acceptability by the right and the left, manageable costs, and the relative ease of state implementation as these changes came in incremental pieces over several years. © 2014 National Association of Social Workers."

For this study, premium data for all health plans offered on the state and federal health insurance marketplaces were collected; the after-subsidy cost of premiums for the least-expensive bronze plan for every county in the United States was calculated; and variations in premium affordability by age, income, and geographic area were assessed. Results indicated that-although marketplace subsidies ensure affordable health insurance for most persons in the United States-many individuals with incomes just above the subsidy threshold will lack affordable coverage and will be exempt from the mandate. Furthermore, young individuals with low incomes often pay as much as or more than older individuals for bronze plans.

The Affordable Care Act (ACA) anticipates that insurance expansion will increase safety-net hospitals' revenues and will reduce DSH payments accordingly. We examined the impact of the ACA's Medicaid DSH reductions on California public hospitals' financial stability by estimating how total DSH costs (uncompensated care costs and Medicaid shortfalls) will change as a result of insurance expansion and the offsetting DSH reductions. Decreases in uncompensated care costs resulting from the ACA insurance expansion may not match the act's DSH reductions because of the high number of people who will remain uninsured, low Medicaid reimbursement rates, and medical cost inflation. Taking these three factors into account, we estimate that California public hospitals' total DSH costs will increase from $2.044 billion in 2010 to $2.363-$2.503 billion in 2019, with unmet DSH costs of $1.381-$1.537 billion. © 2014 Project HOPE-The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc."

We found substantial geographic variation in the volume and tone of insurance product advertisements, political advertisements, and news coverage of the ACA marketplaces. News coverage of the ACA airing in media markets located in states operating federal or partnership marketplaces was more negative than coverage airing in markets located in states running their own marketplaces.

A 10-percent reduction in the Medicare price is estimated to reduce discharges among the nonelderly by about 5 percent. Changes in the Medicare price are not associated with changes in the share of inpatient hospital care provided to the elderly versus nonelderly.

Given the increasing volume of outpatient urological procedures, to our knowledge this study provides the first multi-institutional multivariate analysis of patient factors that contribute to readmission. Materials and Methods Using the 2011 National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database we identified 7,795 patients. Multiple logistic regression was used to predict 30-day unplanned hospital readmissions controlling for demographics, clinical characteristics and comorbidities. Readmission rates of the 5 most common procedures were calculated along with the rate of postoperative complications associated with readmission. Results Outpatient urological surgery had an overall 3.7% readmission rate. The 5 most common procedures were cystourethroscopy and resection of bladder tumor (readmission rate 4.97%), laser prostatectomy (4.27%), transurethral resection of prostate (4.24%), hydrocele excision (1.92%) and sling surgery for urinary incontinence (0.85%). The most common comorbidities in readmitted patients were hypertension, diabetes and smoking. Risk adjusted multiple regression indicated that cancer history (OR 3.48), bleeding disorder (OR 2.03), male gender (OR 1.38), ASA® level 3 or 4 (OR 1.34) and age (OR 1.01) were significant predictors of readmission. Readmitted patients also had a higher 30-day complication rate. Conclusions Readmission after outpatient urological surgery occurs at a rate of 3.7%. A history of cancer, bleeding disorder, male gender, ASA level 3 or 4 and age were associated with readmission along with greater rates of medical and surgical complications.

Methods: A survey of Indiana CHCs from April to May 2013 measured reported STI services, clinic expectations for STI testing and management, barriers to screening and management, and partner services. Reported practices were compared with current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines for STI testing in clinical settings. Results: Although most CHCs reported screening for syphilis (75.0%), chlamydia, and gonorrhea (85.7%), screening generally did not reflect CDC guidelines. Chlamydia and gonorrhea testing was provided primarily at patient request or when symptomatic by 67.9% of CHCs. Syphilis testing at 67.9% of CHCs reflected CDC guidelines for adults 65 years or younger and at 53.6% for first-trimester pregnant women. Chlamydia and gonorrhea screening reflected CDC guidelines for 17.9% of CHCs for gay/bisexual men and 60.9% for first-trimester pregnant women. One-third (35%) of CHCs reported not knowing the expectation for screening pregnant women and gay/bisexual men. Conclusions: It is likely that CHCs are not aware of patient sexual health risks because standard of care screening was observed only for gonorrhea and chlamydia during the first trimester and for syphilis testing when symptoms were present. As CHCs increase their role in preventive care with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, focus must be upon clinician awareness of patient sexual health and training to identify and manage STIs in their patient populations. © 2014 American Sexually Transmitted Diseases Association All rights reserved."

Data Sources/Study Session We used data from the 2003 and 2008 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS), a national probability sample of the U.S. civilian, noninstitutionalized population, linked to Kaiser state Medicaid benefits data, including the state Medicaid-to-Medicare physician fee ratio in 2003 and 2008. Study Design Probit models were used to estimate the probability that eligible individuals received one of five USPSF-recommended preventive services. A difference-in-difference model was used to separate out the effect of changes in the Medicaid payment rate and other factors. Data Collection/Extraction Methods Data were linked using state identifiers. Principal Findings Although Medicaid enrollees had a lower rate of use of the five preventive services in univariate analysis, neither Medicaid enrollment nor changes in Medicaid payment rates had statistically significant effects on meeting screening recommendations for the five screenings. The results were robust to a number of different sensitivity tests. Individual and state characteristics were significant.

Our objective was to determine what physician and areal-level characteristics were associated with working with NPs, PAs or CNMs. Methods: The sample consisted of a convenience sample of physicians through the American Board of Family Medicine (ABFM) website in the fall of 2011. We linked these data to demographic and practice information collected by the ABFM and with provider information supplied from the National Provider Identifier file aggregated at the Primary Care Service Area level. Hierarchical logistic regression models were used to determine variables associated with working with NPs, PAs, or CNMs. Findings: Of the 3,855 family physicians in our sample, 60% reported routinely working with NPs, PAs, or CNMs. In regression analysis, characteristics positively associated with working with NPs, PAs, or CNMs were providing gynecological care (Odds Ratio = 1.23 [95% confidence interval, 1.06-1.42]), multispecialty group practice (OR = 1.72 [1.36-2.18]), any rural setting, and higher availability of PAs (OR = 1.40 [1.10-1.79]).

Research Design: We use experimental data from a simulated patient study to compare new patient appointment rates across FQHC and non-FQHC practices for 3 insurance types (private, Medicaid, and self-pay). Trained auditors, posing as patients requesting the first available new patient appointment, were randomized to call primary care providers in 10 states in late 2012 and early 2013. Multivariate regression models adjust for caller-level, clinic-level, and area-level variables. STUDY Setting: The sample comprises 10,904 calls, including 544 calls to FQHCs. Results: FQHCs grant new patient appointments at high rates, irrespective of patient insurance status. Adjusting for caller, clinic, and area variables, the Medicaid appointment rate at FQHCs is 22 percentage points higher than other primary care practices. Although the appointment rate difference between FQHCs and non-FQHCs is somewhat smaller for the self-pay group, FQHCs are much more likely to provide a lower-cost visit to these patients.

For youth who wish to have their physical appearance congruent with their gender identity, treatment guidelines are available that advocate the use of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues (puberty blockers) and cross-sex hormone regimens. Although medical transition was once considered highly controversial, there is a mounting body of evidence that providing a supportive and affirming environment, as well as appropriate medical intervention, results in improved health outcomes. Primary care pediatricians may be unaware of current guidelines and consequently the need for treatment and/or timely referrals. Transgender youth often face other hurdles to initiation of therapy, including refusal of care and harassment in medical settings, denial of coverage by insurance plans, and the high cost of puberty blockers. Because transgender youth younger than 18 years depend on their families for medical decision making, they may be unable to access necessary medical treatment when parents do not support their transition plan. Medical transition impacts many aspects of the medical system, such as insurance coverage, billing, electronic health records, and preventive health care maintenance. These issues may become more apparent with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and increased use of electronic records and clinical decision support. The implementation of the ACA may also present new opportunities and protections for transgender individuals.

These involved 34 semistructured interviews with ACO administrative and clinical leaders, observation of nine meetings, and a review of documentary materials from each ACO.Findings: We identified very few examples of physicians being held to account as a collective and therefore only limited evidence of collaborative accountability impacting on behavior change. However, ACO leaders do have many mechanisms available to stimulate change across physicians. The challenge is to determine governance structure(s) and accountability mechanisms that facilitate the most effective combination of approaches, measures, incentives, and sanctions to achieve the goals of more accountable care.Practice Implications: Accountability structures and processeswill need to be tailored to localmembership composition, historical evolution, and current stage of development. There are also some common lessons to be drawn. Shared goals and incentives should be reflected through performance criteria. It is important to align measures and thresholds across payers to ensure ACOs are not unnecessarily burdened or compromised by reporting on different and potentially disjointed measures. Finally, emphasis needs to be placed on the importance of credible, transparent data.

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act requires employers to provide hourly waged nursing mothers a private place other than a bathroom, shielded from view, free from intrusion. Minimum requirement for a lactation room would be providing a private space other than a bathroom. Workplace lactation accommodation laws are in place in 24 states, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia. These requirements benefit the breast-pumping mother in an office, but what about the breast-pumping mother who travels? Of women with a child under a year, 55.8% are in the workforce. A significant barrier for working mothers to maintain breastfeeding is traveling, and they will need support from the workplace and the community. This study aimed to determine which airports offer the minimum requirements for a breast-pumping mother: private space other than a bathroom, with chair, table, and electrical outlet. Study Design: A phone survey was done with the customer service representative at 100 U.S. airports. Confirmatory follow-up was done via e-mail.

CABG rehospitalizations are of such concern that they are specifically targeted for action in 2015 under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010). The phenomenon of increasing readmission rates has prompted the Institute for Healthcare Improvement to devise the Triple Aim initiative and the STate Action on Avoidable Rehospitalizations (STAAR) initiative to reduce 30-day readmission rates nationally. Aims: This study explored the impact of implementing STAAR interventions delivered as part of a quality improvement project in incremental bundles on 30-day readmission rates and the experience of care in CABG patients. Specifically, the use of the teach-back patient education method and the scheduling of follow-up cardiology appointments prior to discharge using existing staff were examined. Methods: A quantitative comparative study was conducted with 189 post-CABG patients at a tertiary care facility in the United States over a 2-year period, comparing outcomes between the group of patients prior to implementation of the STAAR interventions and those who later received them. Outcome variables included 30-day readmission rate and patient perception of experience of care. Results: The overall 30-day readmission rate for CABG patients in the postintervention group was decreased to 12.0%, compared to 25.8% in the preintervention group. Of the demographic and health characteristics explored, only chronic lung disease was significantly related to 30-day readmission rates, and only in the postintervention group. Linking Evidence to Action: Thirty-day readmission rates among CABG patients can be reduced and the experience of care can be enhanced through the use of targeted interventions utilizing existing staff and resources. The deliberate incremental implementation of bundled initiatives is an effective strategy in reducing 30-day readmissions in post-CABG patients. © 2014 Sigma Theta Tau International."

Yet it is unclear to what extent this coverage expansion will meaningfully increase access to health care. OBJECTIVE:: The objective of the study was to identify barriers that may persist even after individuals are moved to insurance and to explore racial/ethnic variation in problems accessing health care services. RESEARCH DESIGN:: Data are from a 2008 cross-sectional mixed-mode survey (mail with telephone follow-up in 4 languages), which is unique in measuring a comprehensive set of barriers and in focusing on several select understudied ethnic groups. We examine racial/ethnic variation in cost and coverage, access, and provider-related barriers. The study adhered to a community-based participatory research process. SUBJECTS:: Surveys were obtained from a stratified random sample of adults enrolled in Minnesota Health Care Programs who self-report ethnicity as white, African American, American Indian, Hispanic, Hmong, or Somali (n=1731). RESULTS:: All enrollees reported barriers to getting needed care; enrollees from minority cultural groups (Hmong and American Indian in particular) were more likely to experience problems than whites. Barriers associated with cost and coverage were the most prevalent, with 72% of enrollees reporting 1 or more of these problems. Approximately 63% of enrollees reported 1 or more access barriers. Provider-related barriers were the least prevalent (about 29%) yet revealed the most pervasive disparities. CONCLUSIONS:: Many challenges to care persist for publicly insured adults, particularly minority racial and ethnic groups. The ACA expansion of Medicaid, although necessary, is not sufficient for achieving improved and equitable access to care. Copyright © 2014 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins."

However, unlike generic drugs, biosimilars may be structurally and functionally different from the reference product they are designed to resemble. The FDA has yet to approve any agent via the abbreviated licensure pathway for biosimilars that was passed as part of the Affordable Care Act. The FDA has issued new guidance describing processes by which manufacturers may demonstrate either biosimilarity or interchangeability with an FDA-approved biologic agent, which is required for abbreviated licensure. Biosimilars approved in Europe consist of relatively small molecules; complex large-molecule biosimilars could be subjected to a rigorous and prolonged FDA approval process, which would defeat attempts to develop lower-cost versions of biologic drugs.CONCLUSIONS:Biosimilar development is a consequence of the financial success of biologic therapies and their eventual patent expiration. The pharmaceutical industry must now develop complex biosimilars that resemble FDA-approved biologic agents and invent analytical tools and end points to demonstrate similarity to regulatory authorities.

Although the past 40 years have witnessed tremendous advances in the identification of evidence-based practices (EBPs) in psychological treatments, gaps persist between treatment in experimental settings and services available in the community. In response, considerable attention and large financial commitments have focused in recent years on broad dissemination and implementation efforts designed to improve the quality of psychological services delivered by a variety of generalist practitioners across practice settings. Increasingly, under the influence of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, it is envisioned that these generalists will practice in integrated primary care settings. These advances hold enormous potential, and yet, given the tremendous diversity of mental health problems and human suffering, broad dissemination and implementation efforts to generalists alone may not be sufficient to adequately address the burden of mental illness. Some EBPs may prove too complex for universal dissemination, and the time and expense required for quality dissemination and implementation preclude large-scale training in the treatment of low base rate disorders. As dissemination and implementation efforts work to ensure a quality generalist mental health care workforce, herein we highlight the vital need for available specialty care in the delivery of psychological treatments. Given traditional barriers that interfere with the accessibility of specialty care, we propose the transformative potential of a specialty behavioral telehealth care workforce, transacting with the generalist practitioner workforce to collectively ensure the highest quality and timely delivery of needed treatments to affected individuals. © 2013 American Psychological Association."

Design: Original data collection on the organization of state health-related departments/agencies from 1990 to 2009. Analyses included descriptive statistics, logistic regression, and time-series regression modeling. Setting and Participants: All 50 states. Main Outcomes Measures: Organizational structure of state government related to health in 4 areas (Medicaid, public health, mental health, human services); coupling of Medicaid and public health in the same agency; state budget changes in health policy areas, including Medicaid, public health, and hospitals. Results: The housing of 2 or more health-related functions in the same unit was common, with 21 states combining public health and Medicaid at 1 or more points in time. Eighteen states (36%) reorganized their health agencies/departments during the study period. Controlling for numerous economic, social, and political factors, when the state agency responsible for public health is consolidated with Medicaid, the share of the state budget allocated to Medicaid declined significantly, while public health allocations were unchanged. However, consolidating Medicaid with other services did not impact state Medicaid spending. Conclusions: Government organizational structure related to health varies greatly across states and is somewhat dynamic. When Medicaid and public health functions are consolidated in the same stage agency, public health does not ""lose"" in terms of its share of the state budget.

The clinical and financial outcomes of an initial Medicare annual wellness visit (AWV) administered by a clinical pharmacist practitioner (CPP) in an academic internal medicine clinic are described. Summary. As a result of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Medicare Part B allows for coverage of an AWV at no cost to eligible beneficiaries. The AWV is directed at health prevention, disease detection, and coordination of screening available to beneficiaries. CPPs are pharmacists who are recognized as advanced practice providers in the state of North Carolina and are authorized to administer AWVs. Eligible Medicare beneficiaries at least 65 years of age in an academic internal medicine clinic were mailed invitations to schedule an AWV. Patients who scheduled an AWV were mailed a packet to complete before the visit. During the visit, the packet was reviewed and interventions were made based on prespecified criteria derived from evidence-based medicine recommendations. After completion of the AWV, patients were provided with a detailed and individualized prevention plan. Between August 2011 and May 2012, 98 patients attended an AWV, all performed by the same CPP. The average time from check in to checkout for all patients was 73 minutes. The CPP made 441 interventions during these 98 visits, averaging 4.5 interventions per AWV completed. All initial AWVs were reimbursable up to a maximum of $159.38 per visit. Conclusion.

Although predictive analytics is increasingly looked to as a means for measuring, comparing, and managing this risk, many modeling tools require data inputs that are not readily available and/or additional resources to yield actionable information. This article demonstrates how hospitals and clinicians can use their own structured discharge data to create decision trees that produce highly transparent, clinically relevant decision rules for better managing readmission risk associated with AMI, HF, and PN. For illustrative purposes, basic decision trees are trained and tested using publically available data from the California State Inpatient Databases and an open-source statistical package. As expected, these simple models perform less well than other more sophisticated tools, with areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (or AUC) of 0.612, 0.583, and 0.650, respectively, but achieve a lift of at least 1.5 or greater for higher-risk patients with any of the three conditions. More importantly, they are shown to offer substantial advantages in terms of transparency and interpretability, comprehensiveness, and adaptability. By enabling hospitals and clinicians to identify important factors associated with readmissions, target subgroups of patients at both high and low risk, and design and implement interventions that are appropriate to the risk levels observed, decision trees serve as an ideal application for addressing the challenge of reducing hospital readmissions. © 2014, Springer International Publishing Switzerland."

Because the potential impact of the ACA on urological care remains unknown, we estimated the impact of insurance expansion on the use of inpatient urological surgeries using Massachusetts health care reform as a natural experiment. Methods: We identified nonelderly patients who underwent inpatient urological surgery from 2003 through 2010 using inpatient databases from Massachusetts and 2 control states. Using July 2007 as the transition point between pre-reform and post-reform periods, we performed a difference-in-differences analysis to estimate the effect of insurance expansion on overall and procedure specific rates of inpatient urological surgery. We also performed subgroup analyses according to race, income and insurance status. Results: We identified 1.4 million surgeries performed during the study interval. We observed no change in theoverall rate of inpatient urological surgery for the Massachusetts population as a whole. However, we saw an increase in the rate of inpatient urological surgery for nonwhite and low income patients. Our difference-in-differences analysis confirmed these results (all patients 1.0%, p=0.668; nonwhite patients 9.9%, p=0.006; low income patients 6.6%, p=0.041). At a procedure level insurance expansion caused increased rates of inpatient benign prostatic hyperplasia procedures but had no effect on rates of prostatectomy, cystectomy, nephrectomy, pyeloplasty or percutaneous nephrolithotomy. Conclusions: Insurance expansion in Massachusetts increased the overall rate of inpatient urological surgery only for nonwhite patients and low income patients.

We used the 2001 Medicaid expansion in New York to evaluate changes in use by Medicaid beneficiaries and the uninsured of breast cancer reconstruction, panniculectomy, and lower-extremity trauma management. Methods Data for all patients 19 to 64 years old having undergone the selected procedures between 1998 and 2006 were obtained from the State Inpatient Database. We used an interrupted time series using variance weighted least squares regression to evaluate the effect of Medicaid expansion on the probability that Medicaid beneficiaries or uninsured patients received the procedures. We also determined the predicted use had there been no expansion. New York Census data were used for population-adjusted case-volume calculations. Results Likelihood of Medicaid as the primary payer increased significantly after expansion, 0.34% per quarter (95% CI, 0.28-0.40), without a decrease in uninsured patients receiving these procedures. This resulted in a 7.2% increase in the proportion of Medicaid beneficiaries receiving these procedures, an additional 1.9 Medicaid cases per quarter per 100,000 New York residents. In subgroup analysis, the proportion of Medicaid beneficiaries increased for breast reconstruction (0.28% per quarter; 95% CI, 0.21-0.35) and panniculectomy (0.19% per quarter; 95% CI, 0.1-0.28) without a decrease for the uninsured. Lower-extremity trauma procedures had a decreasing trend in use by uninsured patients with a slight increase for Medicaid beneficiaries (not significant). Conclusions Subspecialty surgeons responded to expansion by increasing volume of procedures for Medicaid beneficiaries. This occurred without decline in care for the uninsured, suggesting that Medicaid expansion resulted in increased access for underserved patients. Although more patients received needed care once they had coverage, subgroup analysis identified persistence of additional barriers to use of certain surgical services. © 2014 by the American College of Surgeons Published by Elsevier Inc."

Purpose To examine whether more generous Medicaid TDT coverage (in terms of cost-sharing requirements and treatments covered) is associated with greater likelihood of quit attempts and successful quit rates. Methods This study used repeated cross-sections from the Current Population Survey (2001-2011), linked to state-level survey data on Medicaid TDT coverage. The sample included 3,071 adult Medicaid recipients who reported smoking 12 months prior to the survey and resided in 28 states with consistent TDT coverage across Medicaid fee-for-service and managed care. Logistic regression models, conducted in October 2013, examined the relationship between state TDT coverage and Medicaid recipients' successful quits and attempted quit rates, controlling for individual and state characteristics. Results Forty-one percent of Medicaid recipients attempted to quit smoking in the prior year and 7% quit successfully. Medicaid recipients in states with the most generous coverage (counseling without copayment and pharmacotherapy with copayment) had the highest predicted successful quit rates (8.3%). Those living in states with no TDT or pharmacotherapy-only coverage had lower predicted successful quit rates (range=4.0%-5.6%). Conclusions These findings suggest that the ACA will increase smoking quit rates among Medicaid recipients. Recipients who have more generous TDT coverage (such as the new Medicaid expansion population and pregnant women) will likely see greater increases in quit rates compared to existing adult Medicaid enrollees. © 2014 American Journal of Preventive Medicine."

As important as were the doctrinal shifts wrought by National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, the ACA's structural changes to public law likely will prove far more important should they become entrenched. The struggle over the ACA has triggered the kind of ""constitutional moment"" that has largely replaced Article V's formal amendment procedure since the Prohibition fiasco. The Court participates in this process, but the definitive and enduring character of these constitutional moments' outcomes springs from broad popular engagement. Despite the Court's ruling and the outcome of the 2012 elections, the battle over whether to implement or shelve the ACA will continue unabated, both federally and in the states, until We the People render a clear decision. Whether the ACA survives or fails will determine the basic principles that guide the development of federalism, social insurance, tax policy, and privatization for decades to come. In each of these areas, the New Deal bequeathed us a delicate accommodation between traditionalist social values and modernizing norms of economic efficiency and interest group liberalism. This balance has come under increasing stress, with individual laws rejecting tradition far more emphatically than the New Deal did. But absent broad popular engagement, no definitive new principles could be established. The ACA's entrenchment would elevate technocratic norms across public law, the first change of our fundamental law since the civil rights revolution. The ACA's failure would rejuvenate individualistic, moralistic, pre-New Deal norms and allow opponents to attempt a counterrevolution against technocracy."

Forty percent of U.S. EDs report having an insurance linkage program. This is the first national study to examine the characteristics of EDs that offer or do not offer these programs. Methods: This was a secondary analysis of data from the National Survey for Preventive Health Services in U.S. EDs conducted in 2008-09. We compared EDs with and without insurance programs across demographic and operational factors using univariate analysis. We then tested our hypotheses using multivariable logistic regression. We also further examined program capacity and priority among the sub-group of EDs with no insurance linkage program. Results: After adjustment, ED-insurance linkage programs were more likely to be located in the West (RR= 2.06, 95% CI = 1.33 - 2.72). The proportion of uninsured patients in an ED, teaching hospital status, and public ownership status were not associated with insurance linkage availability. EDs with linkage programs also offer more preventive services (RR = 1.87, 95% CI = 1.37-2.35) and have greater social worker availability (RR = 1.71, 95% CI = 1.12-2.33) than those who do not. Four of five EDs with a patient mix of ≥25% uninsured and no insurance linkage program reported that they could not offer a program with existing staff and funding. Conclusion: Availability of insurance linkage programs in the ED is not associated with the proportion of uninsured patients served by an ED. Policy or hospital-based interventions to increase insurance linkage should first target the 27% of EDs with high rates of uninsured patients that lack adequate program capacity. Further research on barriers to implementation and cost effectiveness may help to facilitate increased adoption of insurance linkage programs. Copyright 2014 by the article author(s)."

This study examined the impact of removing public funding and instituting a flat fee within an STI clinic under state-mandated insurance coverage. METHODS: Cross-sectional database analysis examined changes in visit volumes, demographics, and payer mix for 4 locations in Massachusetts' largest safety net hospital (STI clinic, primary care [PC], emergency department [ED], obstetrics/gynecology [OB/GYN] for 3 periods: early health reform implementation, reform fully implemented but public STI clinic funding retained, termination of public funding and institution of a US$75 fee in STI clinic for those not using insurance). RESULTS: Sexually transmitted infection visits decreased 20% in STI clinic (P < 0.001), increased 107% in PC (P < 0.001), slightly decreased in ED, and did not change in OB/GYN. The only large demographic shift observed was in the sex of PC patients - women comprised 51% of PC patients seen for STI care in the first time period, but rose sharply to 70% in the third time period (P < 0.0001). After termination of public funding, 50% of STI clinic patients paid flat fee, 35% used public insurance, and 15% used private insurance. CONCLUSIONS: Mandatory insurance, public funding loss, and institution of a flat STI clinic fee were associated with overall decreases in STI visit volume, with significant STI clinic visit decreases and PC STI visit increases. This may indicate partial shifting of STI services into PC. Half of STI clinic patients chose to pay the flat fee even after reform was fully implemented.

Few studies have explored what ""access"" means to low-income families, nor have they examined how elements of access are prioritized when availability, affordability, and acceptability are not all achievable. Therefore, we explored low-income parents' perspectives on accessing health care. Methods: In-depth interviews with a purposeful sample of 29 Oregon parents who responded to a previously administered statewide survey about health insurance. Transcribed interviews were analyzed by a multidisciplinary team using a standard iterative process. Results: Parents highlighted affordability and limited availability as barriers to care; a continuous relationship with a health care provider helped them overcome these barriers. Parents also described the difficult decisions they made between affordability and acceptability in order to get the best care they could for their children. We present a new conceptual model to explain these experiences accessing care with health insurance: the Optimal Care Model. The model shows a transition from optimal care to a breaking point where affordability becomes the driving factor, but the care is perceived as unacceptable because it is with an unknown provider. Conclusions: Even when covered by health insurance, low-income parents face barriers to accessing health care for their children. As the Affordable Care Act and other policies increase coverage options across the United States, many Americans may experience similar barriers and facilitators to health care access. The Optimal Care Model provides a useful construct for better understanding experiences that may be encountered when the newly insured attempt to access available, acceptable, and affordable health care services. © 2014 Angier et al."

The experience in Massachusetts, which implemented a similar reform beginning in 2006, should provide important lessons about the effect of health care reform on emergency department (ED) utilization. Our objective is to understand the extent to which Massachusetts health care reform was associated with changes in ED utilization. Methods We compared changes in ED utilization at the population level for individuals from areas of the state that were affected minimally by health care reform with those from areas that were affected the most, as well as for those younger than 65 years and aged 65 years or older. We used a difference-in-differences identification strategy to compare rates of ED visits in the prereform period, during the reform, and in the postreform period. Because we did not have population-level data on insurance status, we estimated area-level insurance rates by using the percentage of actual visits made during each period by individuals with insurance. Results We studied 13.3 million ED visits during 2004 to 2009. Increasing insurance coverage in Massachusetts was associated with increasing use of the ED; these results were consistent across all specifications, including the younger than 65 years versus aged 65 years or older comparison. Depending on the model used, the implementation of health care reform was estimated to result in an increase in ED visits per year of between 0.2% and 1.2% within reform and 0.2% and 2.2% postreform compared with the prereform period. Conclusion The implementation of health care reform in Massachusetts was associated with a small but consistent increase in the use of the ED across the state. Whether this was due to the elimination of financial barriers to seeking care in the ED, a persistent shortage in access to primary care for those with insurance, or some other cause is not entirely clear and will need to be addressed in future research. © 2014 by the American College of Emergency Physicians."

Few people understand that besides being places of confinement, jails function as health care providers. The separation of jails from community results in disjointed health care services and treatment for individuals cycling in and out of jail. Healthcare providers in the community have little knowledge of the care their patients have received in jail; the same can be said of jail health providers about care provided in the community. With the passage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH), the federal government took the lead respectively in expanding health insurance coverage and in spurring the adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) and the development of health information exchanges (HIEs). Taken together, these initiatives place a strong emphasis on promoting continuity of care. With the expansion of Medicaid under the ACA, many of the individuals leaving jail will have access to health insurance for the first time. Community-based providers to the newly insured will want to know about the care that was provided in the jail. The developing technological infrastructure would seem to offer the best way to access this information. However linking the community and jail information systems is not just a technological issue, but requires the cooperation of all stakeholders.THIS PAPER PRESENTS TWO CASE STUDIES: one in which a single champion made the decision to link the jail health care system to the local HIE and the other where all stakeholders were included in the process. In the first case study, the jail healthcare system reverted to its ""island"" status when the HIE was abandoned without protest from community stakeholders. In the second case study, the multiple stakeholder approach, while not necessarily a complete guarantee of long-term success, ensured that the jail healthcare system could not so easily go back to being an island cut off from the rest of the community."

Reducing the occurrence of unplanned readmissions has become a more urgently focused topic. As part of the health care system, care management aligns with physicians to significantly improve service, financial, and clinical care outcomes. To address the changing health care climate in 2008, care management services were restructured at an academic university medical center located in 1 of the 3 largest counties in California. Changing from a unit-based to a service-based care management model partnered care managers and social workers with physician services. We sought to assess the effect of this change on surrogates for patient experience and clinical quality of care.Primary Practice Setting: Tertiary academic medical center in southern California.Methodology and Sample: Retrospective data were collected from 2 databases for all hospital patient care services from November 2008 to January 2010 to determine whether clinical quality of care and experiential service improvements were realized. Primary outcomes included all-cause and related readmission rates. Secondary outcomes were Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (H-CAHPS) scores. An interrupted time series analysis compared data from the single institution for the diffusion and postintervention periods.Results: Comparing data from the diffusion and postintervention periods, the rate of disease-related readmissions decreased significantly (mean 5.43-4.58, p <.05), and all-cause readmissions also decreased, although the difference failed to achieve statistical significance (11.42-10.49, p =.056). H-CAHPS scores with the patient response of ""recommend this hospital"" was unchanged over the 2 time points (mean 78.9%-77.8%, p =.26731). Data also showed stable care management staffing rates whereas average daily census (ADC) increased over time (ADC 274-297).Implications for Case Management Practice: With health reform driving value-driven care transformation, partnering care managers and social workers with physician services has the potential to impact the patient's experience as well as financial and clinical care outcomes. Care managers serve a significant role in improving the clinical quality of care by reinforcing a consistent and clear message by the health care team to the patient during the entire hospitalization, not just at the time of discharge. At one institution, partnering physicians with care managers through the acute care continuum (service-based care management) appeared to reduce readmissions without compromising patient satisfaction. Both readmission reduction and effective patient satisfaction scores impact the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services value-based purchasing reimbursement calculations.

Accountable care organizations (ACOs) are 1 component of this evolution, and 1 of their charges is to reduce hospital readmission rates for key diagnoses such as congestive heart failure (CHF) and other cardiovascular comorbidities. Lack of patient follow-up and adherence are 2 major causes of readmission. Providing strong medication management is 1 of the common factors in successful readmission programs. We discuss here how electronic solutions might strengthen these medication management programs. Objective: To explore the key issues and strategies that affect the use of electronic medication reconciliation processes and to identify the role the Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy (AMCP) can play in spearheading the adoption of electronic solutions. Methods: This was a descriptive analysis of the medication reconciliation process and the factors that promote or limit the application of electronic solutions to medication reconciliation and transitions of care processes. AMCP convened a panel of managed care, hospital, community, ACO, and medication therapy management pharmacists; technology vendors; and other health care stakeholders with an expertise or interest in transitions of care. Results: In the last few years, there has been considerable uptake of electronic solutions to the admission medication reconciliation process, largely due to increasing penetration of vendors using sophisticated medication history tools. The current electronic solutions to the admission medication reconciliation record are remarkably similar in content. Some pilots for electronic solutions to discharge medication reconciliation are emerging. Conclusions: The focus group recommended specific programs AMCP can pursue to increase the adoption of electronic solutions for medication reconciliation. One important aspect to address is developing a business case that documents the return on investment (ROI) for electronic solutions. Besides electronic efficiencies, the ROI needs to include hospital readmission penalties, loss of Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) incentives, avoidance of duplicative efforts, and payer costs for readmissions. Managed care pharmacy needs to be engaged in assessing its incentives for promoting electronic solutions. © 2014, Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy."

Objective. To simulate what episodes of care in spinal surgery might look like in a bundled payment system and to evaluate the associated costs and characteristics. Summary of Background Data: Episode-based payment bundling has received considerable attention as a potential method to help curb the rise in health care spending and is being investigated as a new payment model as part of the Affordable Care Act. Although earlier studies investigated bundled payments in a number of surgical settings, very few focused on spine surgery, specifically. Methods: We analyzed data from MarketScan. Patients were included in the study if they underwent cervical or lumbar spinal surgery during 2000-2009, had at least 2-year preoperative and 90-day postoperative follow-up data. Patients were grouped on the basis of their diagnosis-related group (DRG) and then tracked in simulated episodes-of-care/payment bundles that lasted for the duration of 30, 60, and 90 days after the discharge from the indexsurgical hospitalization. The total cost associated with each episodeof-care duration was measured and characterized. Results: A total of 196,918 patients met our inclusion criteria. Significant variation existed between DRGs, ranging from $11,180 (30-day bundle, DRG 491) to $107,642 (30-day bundle, DRG 456). There were significant cost variations within each individual DRG. Postdischarge care accounted for a relatively small portion of overall bundle costs (range, 4%-8% in 90-day bundles). Total bundle costs remained relatively flat as bundle-length increased (total average cost of 30-day bundle: $33,522 vs. $35,165 for 90-day bundle). Payments to hospitals accounted for the largest portion of bundle costs (76%). Conclusion: There exists significant variation in total health care costs for patients who undergo spinal surgery, even within a given DRG. Better characterization of impacts of a bundled payment system in spine surgery is important for understanding the costs of index procedure hospital, physician services, and postoperative care on potential future health care policy decision making.

This has also stimulated a new direction of thinking for the profession of nursing. New payment and priority structures, where value is placed ahead of volume in care, will start to define our health system in new and unknown ways for years. One thing we all know for sure: we cannot afford the same inefficient models and systems of care of yesterday any longer. The Data-Driven Model for Excellence in Staffing was created as the organizing framework to lead the development of best practices for nurse staffing across the continuum through research and innovation. Regardless of the setting, nurses must integrate multiple concepts with the value of professional nursing to create new care and staffing models. Traditional models demonstrate that nurses are a commodity. If the profession is to make any significant changes in nurse staffing, it is through the articulation of the value of our professional practice within the overall health care environment. This position paper is organized around the concepts from the Data-Driven Model for Excellence in Staffing. The main concepts are: Core Concept 1: Users and Patients of Health Care, Core Concept 2: Providers of Health Care, Core Concept 3: Environment of Care, Core Concept 4: Delivery of Care, Core Concept 5: Quality, Safety, and Outcomes of Care. This position paper provides a comprehensive view of those concepts and components, why those concepts and components are important in this new era of nurse staffing, and a 3-year challenge that will push the nursing profession forward in all settings across the care continuum. There are decades of research supporting various changes to nurse staffing. Yet little has been done to move that research into practice and operations. While the primary goal of this position paper is to generate research and innovative thinking about nurse staffing across all health care settings, a second goal is to stimulate additional publications. This includes a goal of at least 20 articles in Nursing Economic$ on best practices in staffing and care models from across the continuum over the next 3 years."

Limited resources dictate that physicians must become more efficient at providing high quality care. In an effort to provide financial incentive for delivering quality care, the federal government instituted value-based purchasing to transform Medicare from a passive payer of claims to an active purchaser of medical care. Healthcare providers must follow the basic tenants of certain quality principles to maximize reimbursement under the value-based purchasing system."

Methods: We called primary care physician (general practitioner, family practice, internal medicine, obstetrics/gynecology, and pediatric) offices in Mississippi three times, citing different types of health insurance coverage in each call, and asked for a new patient appointment with a physician. Results: Of all of the offices contacted, 7% of offices were not currently accepting new patients who had private insurance, 15% of offices were not currently accepting new Medicare patients, 38% were not currently accepting new Medicaid patients, and 9% to 21% of office calls were unresolved in one telephone call to the office.

Study Design and Methods: First difference regressions of county-level MA payment and enrollment data from CMS from 2006 to 2010. Results: A $10 decrease in the per member/per month rebate to MA plans was associated with a 0.20 percentage point (0.9%) decrease in MA penetration (P <.001) and a 7.1% decline in the average MA enrollee's risk score (P <.001). These effects are small overall, but larger in counties with low levels of traditional Medicare spend-ing; a $10 decrease in monthly rebates was associated with a 0.64 percentage point decline in MA penetration and a 10% decrease in risk score. ACA reforms are predicted to reduce the level of rebates in lower-spending counties, leading to enrollment decreases of 1.7 to 1.9 percentage points in the lowest-spending counties. The simulation predicts that the disenrollment would come from MA enrollees with higher risk scores. Conclusions: MA enrollment responds to availability of supplemental benefits supported by rebates. ACA provisions designed to lower MA spending will predominantly affect Medicare beneficiaries living in counties where MA plans may be unable to offer a comparable product at a price similar to that of traditional Medicare."

Design Descriptive statistics and multivariate regression analysis of the energy, total fat, saturated fat, trans fat, sodium, carbohydrate and protein levels of 28 433 regular and 1833 children's menu items. Setting Energy and nutrition information provided on restaurant websites or upon request, and secondary databases on restaurant characteristics. Subjects The top 400 US chain restaurants by sales, based on the 2009 list of the Restaurants & Institutions magazine. Results Complete nutrition information was reported for 245 (61 %) restaurants. Appetizers had more energy, fat and sodium than all other item types. Children's menu specialty beverages had more fat, saturated fat and carbohydrates than comparable regular menu beverages. The majority of main entreés fell below one-third of the US Department of Agriculture's estimated daily energy needs, but as few as 3 % were also within limits for sodium, fat and saturated fat. Main entreés had significantly more energy, fat and saturated fat in family-style restaurants than in fast-food restaurants. Restaurants that made nutrition information easily accessible on websites had significantly lower energy, fat and sodium contents across menu offerings than those providing information only upon request. Conclusions The paper provides a comprehensive view of chain restaurant menu nutrition prior to nationwide labelling laws. It offers baseline data to evaluate how restaurants respond after laws are implemented. © 2012 The Authors."

Children, especially those who are low income and have special needs, are eligible for a range of supports including income supports, health care coverage, vocational and educational supports. These supports are critical to sound health because they ensure access to necessary medical services, while also offsetting the social determinants that negatively affect health. Unfortunately, as children transition into adulthood, eligibility for these benefits can change abruptly or even end entirely. If medical providers have a better understanding of five transition key dates, they can positively impact their patients' health by ensuring continuous coverage through the transition to adulthood. The key dates are as follows: (1) transition services for students with an Individualized Education Program (IEP) must begin by age 16 (in some states such as Illinois, these services must be in place by age 14 1/2); (2) at age 18, eligibility for income supports may change; (3) at age 19, eligibility for Medicaid may change; (4) at graduation, eligibility for educational supports will end unless steps are taken to extend those benefits until age 22; and (5) when individuals prepare to enter the workforce, they will become eligible for vocational rehabilitation services. With an understanding of these key transition dates and how to partner with social services and advocacy organizations on behalf of their patients, medical providers can help to ensure that transition-age patients retain the holistic social services and supports they need to protect their health. © 2014 - IOS Press and the authors."

We anticipate having our yearly discussions over the worthiness of state's motorcycle helmet law. We'll find ourselves advocating for stricter texting-while-operating laws and seat belt enforcement. The insurance companies will probably get an earful over narrow networks and prior authorization. Telemedicine will likely come up; as will the pharmaceutical industry and their numerous endeavors. We'll have to watch some public health groups who will attempt to offer solutions to their own issues for their select set of patients. We're the only state without a Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP), so that will be in play Plus, the chiropractors, optometrists, midwives, etc., never seem to go away And on and on and on...

The ""new"" health care models adopted by the two jurisdictions utilize free market principles for reasons of quality, efficiency, and cost, but also feature characteristics of a state-run model, through the provision of a safety net for citizens and a buffer against the commodification of health. In this sense, the health care systems of the US and UK are more congruent than they were. Here we identify two distinct narratives that emerge from health care reform undertaken in these jurisdictions. The ""revolutionary"" narrative views the reforms as fundamental change whilst the ""evolutionary"" narrative accepts them as natural development. We argue that neither the revolutionary nor the evolutionary narrative adequately characterizes the reforms undertaken in health care because neither takes sufficient account of the broader setting in which reform has occurred. In seeking to examine and explain the jurisdictions' apparent drive to the middle, we propose a distinctive evolutionary narrative, that of ""convergence,"" which, as well as adopting a less parochial perspective on developments in health care policy and provision, also situates the reforms politically, constitutionally, and comparatively. © 2014 American Society of Law, Medicine & Ethics, Inc."

Inclusive shared savings may be particularly attractive in situations in which treatments, such as those for gastric cancer, are similar in clinical effectiveness and have modest differences in convenience but substantially differ in cost. Inclusive shared savings incorporates features of typical insurance coverage, shared savings, and value-based insurance design but differs from value-based insurance design, which merely seeks to decrease or eliminate out-of-pocket costs. Inclusive shared savings offers financial incentives to physicians and patients to promote the use of lower-cost, but equally effective, interventions and should be evaluated in a rigorous trial or demonstration project.

With more changes in healthcare policy forthcoming, it is increasingly important for the orthopaedic traumatologist to understand how changes in policy will affect practice. Historically, the motivators for change have remained largely the same over the past 50 years. The development of diagnosis-related groups, the resource-based relative value scale, and the sustainable growth rate are 3 defining policies that were designed to control costs, but which had an unexpected effect on those caring for the trauma population. Healthcare reform has a unique effect on those systems where care is dictated by a defining event or injury. Evaluating the development of trauma systems, the authors find that legislation directed toward the trauma population has been driven by the study of patient outcomes, providing an opportunity for orthopaedic traumatologists to contribute to future changes in policy. As healthcare policy changes begin to take effect, having a thorough understanding of reform and its drivers will be increasingly important in taking an active role in advocating for the field of orthopaedic trauma and its patients. © 2014 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins."

However, future BPs will need to account for how individual providers will be compensated for their services, and acceptance of BP as a viable health care payment model will depend on the ability of payers and providers to collaborate in a new way to address several operational and implementation challenges.

The goal of the Journal - to provide an outlet for evidence-based approaches to healthcare that underscore the important scientific and clinical contributions of psychology in medical settings - is discussed. The contemporary relevance of this approach is related to the current implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care and its focus on accountability and the development of an interprofessional healthcare workforce; both of which have been foci of the Journal throughout its history and will continue to be so into the future. Several recommendations of future topic areas for the Journal to highlight regarding scientific, practice, policy, and education and training in professional health service psychology are offered. Successfully addressing these topics will support the growth of the field of psychology in the ever evolving healthcare system of the future and continue ensure that the Journal is a key source of professional information in health service psychology. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York."

The purpose of our study was to examine the influence of economic, political, and legal factors on state implementation of ACA 2302. Using data from 2010 to 2012, our analysis revealed that for early implementers economic, political or legal factors did not influence implementation of ACA 2302. In 2011, states that were engaged in Medicaid cost containment efforts were more likely to implement ACA 2302 and in 2012, states experiencing a budgetary crisis were less likely to implement ACA 2302. Our findings suggest that state-level implementation of ACA 2302 may be an important bellwether for future healthcare reform implementations. © The Author(s) 2013."

This marginalized group continues to experience considerable difficulty in obtaining culturally competent health care despite recommendations by professional organizations and introduction of antidiscrimination legislation. This review examines communication and procedural barriers to transgender health care and suggests practical steps to help ameliorate disparities and unequal treatment. Methods: Publications addressing health disparities and communication and procedural barriers to health care of transgender persons were identified by a structured search of electronic databases. The most pertinent articles are reviewed and consolidated with the authors’ collective experiences. Results: To improve their interactions and communication with transgender persons, health care providers can take a variety of practical steps in several key areas: office environment, registration forms, initial interview and assessment, confidentiality, personnel training, awareness of and compliance with applicable antidiscrimination legislation, health insurance-related issues, and outreach and transgender health promotion. Conclusions: Enhancing patient satisfaction through culturally competent health care, quality assurance, and patient feedback is critical to creating open lines of communication between practitioner and patient and fostering a favourable context for transgender patient care. © W.

This process is especially difficult for youth with special health care needs. Many youth do not receive the age-appropriate medical care they need and are at risk during this vulnerable time. Previous research has identified barriers that may prevent effective transition, and protocols have been developed to improve the process. Health outcomes related to successful transition have yet to be fully defined. Health care transition can also be influenced by education of providers, but there are gaps in medical education at the undergraduate, graduate, and postgraduate levels. Current changes in federal health policy allow improved health care coverage, provide some new financial incentives, and test new structures for transitional care, including the evolution of accountable care organizations (ACO). Future work must test how these systems changes will affect quality of care. Finally, transition protocols exist in various medical subspecialties; however, national survey results show no improvement in transition readiness, and there are no consistent measures of what constitutes transition success. In order to advance the field of transition, research must be done to integrate transition curricula at the undergraduate, graduate, and postgraduate levels; to provide advance financial incentives and pilot the ACO model in centers providing care to youth during transition; to define outcome measures of importance to transition; and to study the effectiveness of current transition tools on improving these outcomes. © 2014 by Academic Pediatric Association."

However, managers have other tools to encourage retirement or encourage staying on the job-within legal constraints and consistent with current health insurance changes that may make pre-65 retirement more desirable. In using these tools, managers must consider demographic realities that offer a large cohort available to replace retirees. To assist managers, a qualitative study among human resource experts probed how companies decide between encouraging retirement and encouraging staying on the job and also how each is accomplished to maintain a workforce best matched to job requirements. Suggestions for marketing retirement include starting early to encourage saving so that employees can afford to retire and improving the retirement 'product' by flexible alternatives to full-time work, including self-employment. Suggestions for keeping employees on the job include tailoring schedules and rewards to the preferences and needs of individuals who might otherwise retire. © 2014 Kelley School of Business, Indiana University."

As the rest of the nation undertakes similar reforms, it is unknown how the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), one of many important Federal health care programs, will be affected. Our state-level study approach assessed the effects of health reform on utilization of VHA services in Massachusetts from 2005 to 2011. Models were adjusted for state-level demographic and economic characteristics, including health insurance rates, unemployment rates, median household income, poverty rates, and percent of population 65 years and older. No statistically significant associative change was observed in Massachusetts relative to other states over this time period.

Pisacano Scholars, a group of leaders in family medicine supported by the American Board of Family Medicine, gathered for a 2-day symposium in April 2013 to explore the history of the FFM project and outline a vision for the next phase of this work-FFM version 2.0 (v2.0). After learning about the original FFM project (FFM v1.0), the group held interactive discussions using the World Café approach to conversational leadership. This commentary summarizes the discussions and highlights major themes relevant to FFM v2.0 identified by the group. The group endorsed the FFM v1.0 recommendations as still relevant and marveled at the progress made toward achieving many of those goals. Most elements of FFM v1.0 have moved forward, and some have been incorporated into policy blueprints for reform. Now is the time to refocus attention on facets of FFM v1.0 not yet realized and to identify key aspects missing from FFM v1.0.

We examine how variation in reimbursement incentives and administration among two Medicaid managed care plans impacts utilization and spending. We use a quasi-experimental approach exploiting the timing and county-specific implementation of Medicaid managed care mandates in two contiguous regions of Kentucky. We find large differences in the relative success of each plan in reducing utilization and spending that are likely driven by important differences in plan design. The plan that capitated primary care physicians and contracted out many administrative responsibilities to an experienced managed care organization achieved significant reductions in outpatient and professional utilization. The plan that opted for a fee-for-service reimbursement scheme with a group withhold and handled administration internally saw a much more modest reduction in outpatient utilization and an increase in professional utilization. © 2014 The Authors."

This article describes an evaluation of a 2011-2012 community health needs assessment (CHNA) of Kane County, Illinois. The evaluation customized and used a reliable and valid Web-based survey, the New York State Community Health Assessment Usefulness Survey, to measure Kane County CHNA user perceptions of content, format, and impact utility of the assessment. Survey respondents were community leaders and members from a diverse set of professional backgrounds and were nearly evenly divided between those who had actively participated in the CHNA and those that had not. Respondents were overwhelmingly positive in their evaluation of the Kane CHNA, with an average per item score of greater than 3 on a 4-point Likert scale, although respondents who were not involved in the CHNA process were less positive than those directly involved.

We examined variations in tobacco surcharges for plans offered through the state and federal health insurance exchanges, or Marketplaces. The plan with the median surcharge had only 10 percent higher premiums for tobacco users compared to nonusers, and nine in ten plans charged a lower surcharge than allowed. Even with such lower-than-allowed surcharges, tobacco users lacked affordable coverage-defined as access to at least one plan with premiums of less than 8 percent of income after subsidies-in more states than did nonusers. Higher premiums could encourage tobacco users to opt out of coverage. Our results also suggest that the variation in tobacco surcharges may result in the sorting of tobacco users and nonusers into different plans. © 2014 by Project HOPE - The People-to-People Health Foundation."

Undocumented immigrants are restricted from accessing public health and social service as a result of their immigration status. The Patient Protection and Affordability Care Act restricts undocumented immigrants from participating in state exchange insurance market places, further limiting them from accessing equitable health care services. This commentary calls for comprehensive policy reform that expands access to health care for undocumented immigrants based on an analysis of immigrant health policies and their impact on health care expenditures, public health, and the role of health care providers. The intersectional nature of immigration and health care policy emphasizes the need for nurse policymakers to advocate for comprehensive policy reform aimed at improving the health and well-being of immigrants and the nation as a whole. © The Author(s) 2014 Reprints and permissions:]br]sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav."

BACKGROUND:: The Affordable Health Care Act provides Medicare beneficiaries access to AWVs. Nurse-run AWVs offer individualized education, reinforce health screening recommendations, and may enhance the patients' intent to complete the screenings. METHODS:: A nonexperimental comparative study was conducted using data collected from chart audits comparing patients who only attended the AWV, patients who attended the AWV linked with a physician visit, and patients who have not attended an AWV. RESULTS:: Patients who attended the AWV showed greater adherence to mammogram completion regardless of the link to the physician follow-up visit. Differences in adherence to colonoscopy recommendations were not significant, likely because of the low number of colonoscopies reported. CONCLUSIONS:: Nurse-run AWV clinics are associated with adherence to mammograms and show promise of increasing colonoscopy compliance.

In this study, we identify specific cultural and socioeconomic predictors of Asian Americans who work in small businesses to identify subgroups at a greater disadvantage than others in obtaining health insurance. Logistic regression models were fitted using a sample of 3,819 Asian American small business owners and employers extracted from pooled 2005-2012 California Health Interview Survey data. We found that individuals with low income levels, Korean Americans, U.S.-born South Asian and Southeast Asian (other than Vietnamese) Americans, immigrants without citizenship (particularly those lacking a green card), and individuals with limited English proficiency had higher odds of lacking coverage. The odds of being uninsured did not differ between small business owners and employees. Based upon these key findings, we propose several strategies to expand coverage for Asian Americans working in small businesses and their most vulnerable subgroups. © Meharry Medical College."

The most reasonable assessments of US and international health reforms need to rely on the alternative method, and so when critics of health reform rely on the standard method, their arguments are unsound."

Background and Purpose As health care reform emerges, state practice acts expand and new models of dental hygiene practice are created and implemented, dental hygienists will assume leadership positions that may be quite different from the more traditional leadership roles they assume today. These dental hygienist leaders will envision, creatively design and implement oral health care programs to improve the oral health of the public. Mentoring, a vital component of leadership development, is critical for dental hygienists to acquire knowledge, guidance, and growth. Methods This paper provides a literature-supported overview of leadership and mentoring principles applicable to dental hygienists in their personal and professional lives. Opportunities for dental hygienists to assume leadership roles are also described. Conclusions Dental hygienists are poised to become leaders and vital members of the professional team promoting and integrating oral health care as a part of general health. Consequently, the dental hygienist's leadership roles are likely to expand and can be strengthened through mentoring relationships and mentoring teams. Ultimately, this can increase professional growth and career satisfaction for the dental hygienist as well as improve oral health care for the public. © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

Although these venues can uniquely serve community health needs, little is known about customer characteristics and outreach efforts. Intercept survey of markets and market customers between August 2010 and October 2011 at three medical centers in different geographic regions of the US (Duke University Medical Center, Cleveland Clinic, and Penn State Hershey Medical Center) were conducted. Markets reported serving 180-2,000 customers per week and conducting preventive medicine education sessions and community health programs. Customers (n = 585) across markets were similar in sociodemographic characteristics - most were middle-aged, white, and female, who were employees of their respective medical center. Health behaviors of customers were similar to national data. The surveyed medical center farmers' markets currently serve mostly employees; however, markets have significant potential for community outreach efforts in preventive medicine. If farmers' markets can broaden their reach to more diverse populations, they may play an important role in contributing to community health. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York."

Although reconstruction rates have increased, racial/ethnic disparities in breast reconstruction persist. Insurance coverage facilitates access to care, but few studies have examined whether health insurance ameliorates disparities. Methods: We used the Nationwide Inpatient Sample for 2002 through 2006 to examine the relationships between health insurance coverage, race/ethnicity, and breast reconstruction rates among women who underwent mastectomy for breast cancer. We examined reconstruction rates as a function of the interaction of race and the primary payer (self-pay, private health insurance, government) while controlling for patient comorbidity, and we used generalized estimating equations to account for clustering and hospital characteristics. Findings: Minority women had lower breast reconstruction rates than White women (adjusted odds ratio [AOR],0.57 for African American; AOR, 0.70 for Hispanic; AOR, 0.45 for Asian; p<.001). Uninsured women (AOR,0.33) and those with public coverage were less likely to undergo reconstruction (AOR,0.35; p<.001) than privately insured women. Racial/ethnic disparities were less prominent within insurance types. Minority women, whether privately or publicly insured, had lower odds of undergoing reconstruction than White women. Among those without insurance, reconstruction rates did not differ by race/ethnicity. Conclusions: Insurance facilitates access to care, but does not eliminate racial/ethnic disparities in reconstruction rates. Our findings-which reveal persistent health care disparities not explained by patient health status-should prompt efforts to promote both access to and use of beneficial covered services for women with breast cancer. © 2014 Jacobs Institute of Women's Health."

Data Sources/Study Setting Medicare inpatient claims to calculate condition-specific readmission rates. Medicare cost reports and other sources to determine a hospital's share of duals, profit margin, and characteristics. Study Design Regression analyses and projections were used to estimate risk-adjusted readmission rates and financial penalties under the HRRP. Findings were compared across groups of hospitals, determined based on their share of duals, to assess differential impacts of the HRRP. Principal Findings Both patient dual-eligible status and a hospital's dual-eligible share of Medicare discharges have a positive impact on risk-adjusted hospital readmission rates. Under current Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service methodology, which does not adjust for socioeconomic status, high-dual hospitals are more likely to have excess readmissions than low-dual hospitals. As a result, HRRP penalties will disproportionately fall on high-dual hospitals, which are more likely to have negative all-payer margins, raising concerns of unintended consequences of the program for vulnerable populations. Conclusions Policies to reduce hospital readmissions must balance the need to ensure continued access to quality care for vulnerable populations. © Health Research and Educational Trust."

From October 2012 to May 2013 we fielded the National Survey of Accountable Care Organizations, the first such survey of public and private ACOs. We found that 51 percent of ACOs were physician-led, with another 33 percent jointly led by physicians and hospitals. In 78 percent of ACOs, physicians constituted a majority of the governing board, and physicians owned 40 percent of ACOs.

However, the design brings with it many new challenges. One such challenge is the optimal use of pharmaceuticals. Most ACOs have not yet focused on this integral facet of care, even though medications are a critical component to achieving the lower costs and improved quality that are anticipated with this new model. Objective: To evaluate whether ACOs are prepared to maximize the value of medications for achieving quality benchmarks and cost offsets. Methods: During the fall of 2012, an electronic readiness self-assessment was developed using a portion of the questions and question methodology from the National Survey of Accountable Care Organizations, along with original questions developed by the authors. The assessment was tested and subsequently revised based on feedback from pilot testing with 5 ACO representatives. The revised assessment was distributed via e-mail to a convenience sample (n=175) of ACO members of the American Medical Group Association, Brookings-Dartmouth ACO Learning Network, and Premier Healthcare Alliance. Results: The self-assessment was completed by 46 ACO representatives (26% response rate). ACOs reported high readiness to manage medications in a few areas, such as transmitting prescriptions electronically (70%), being able to integrate medical and pharmacy data into a single database (54%), and having a formulary in place that encourages generic use when appropriate (50%). However, many areas have substantial room for improvement with few ACOs reporting high readiness. Some notable areas include being able to quantify the cost offsets and hence demonstrate the value of appropriate medication use (7%), notifying a physician when a prescription has been filled (9%), having protocols in place to avoid medication duplication and polypharmacy (17%), and having quality metrics in place for a broad diversity of conditions (22%). Conclusions: Developing the capabilities to support, monitor, and ensure appropriate medication use will be critical to achieve optimal patient outcomes and ACO success. The ACOs surveyed have embarked upon an important journey towards this goal, but critical gaps remain before they can become fully accountable. While many of these organizations have begun adopting health information technologies that allow them to maximize the value of medications for achieving quality outcomes and cost offsets, a significant lag was identified in their inability to use these technologies to their full capacities. In order to provide further guidance, the authors have begun documenting case studies for public release that would provide ACOs with examples of how certain medication issues have been addressed by ACOs or relevant organizations. The authors hope that these case studies will help ACOs optimize the value of pharmaceuticals and achieve the ""triple aim"" of improving care, health, and cost. © 2014, Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy."

Regardless of whether health departments provide direct clinical services (and many will), they will manage unprecedented quantities of sensitive information for the public health core functions of assurance and assessment, including populationlevel health surveillance and metrics. Absent improved capabilities, health departments risk vestigial status, with consequences for vulnerable populations. Developments in electronic health records, interoperability and information exchange, public information sharing, decision support, and cloud technologies can support information management if health departments have appropriate capabilities. The need for national engagement in and consensus on these capabilities and their importance to health department sustainability make them appropriate for consideration in the context of accreditation."

This article summarizes the major aspects of the Sunshine Act affecting medical research, how it interacts with existing laws and policies, and identifi es important unresolved issues and implementation challenges that still lie ahead with the rollout of the legislation underway. The Sunshine Act primarily depends on disclosure as a regulatory tool. As such, its long-term impact remains open to question.

Expansions in Medicaid through less restrictive income eligibility requirements and the resulting influx of new enrolleesmay further erode access to care for those already enrolled in Medicaid. OBJECTIVE To assess the effect of previous Medicaid expansions on self-reported access to care and the use of emergency department services by Medicaid enrollees. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Quasi-experimental difference-in-differences design among 1714 adult Medicaid enrollees in 10 states that expanded Medicaid between June 1, 2000, and October 1, 2009, and 5097 Medicaid enrollees in 14 bordering control states that did not expand Medicaid. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Self-reported access to care and annualized emergency department use. RESULTS Among states expanding their Medicaid program for adults, the mean income eligibility level increased from 82.6%to 144.2%of the federal poverty level. Income eligibility in matched control states remained constant at 77.1%of the federal poverty level. The proportion of adults reporting being enrolled in Medicaid increased from 7.2%to 8.8% in expansion states and from 6.1% to 6.4%in matched control states. In Medicaid program expansion states, the proportion of Medicaid enrollees reporting poor access to care declined from 8.5%before the expansion to 7.3%after the expansion. In matched control states, the proportion of Medicaid enrollees reporting poor access to care remained constant at 5.3%. The proportion of enrollees reporting any emergency department use decreased from 41.2% to 40.1%in expansion states and from 37.3%to 36.1% in matched control states. In the period following expansions, newly eligible enrollees reported poorer access to care than previously enrolled beneficiaries, although the overall difference between groups did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE We found no evidence that expanding the number of individuals eligible for Medicaid coverage eroded perceived access to care or increased the use of emergency services among adult Medicaid enrollees.

We recognize the need to assess the value of our contributions rather than concentrating primarily on generating revenue. This recent focus is a result of both increased cost-containment efforts and regulatory demands. Imaging 3.0 is a value-based perspective that intends to describe and facilitate value-based imaging. Imaging 3.0 includes a broad set of initiatives addressing the visibility of radiologists, and emphasizing quality and safety oversight by radiologists, which are new directions of focus for us. Imaging 3.0 also addresses subspecialty imaging and off-hours imaging, which are existing areas of practice that are emblematic of inconsistent service delivery across all hours. Looking to the future, Imaging 3.0 describes how imaging services could be integrated into the framework of accountable care organizations. Although all these efforts may be essential, they necessitate manpower expenditures, and these efforts are not directly covered by revenue. If we recognize the urgency of need in developing these concepts, we can justify the manpower and staffing expenditures each organization is willing to shoulder in reaching Imaging 3.0.

However, little work has been done to describe available financial resources and barriers to connecting those resources to patients. Methods: This was a single-center, qualitative study that used semistructured interviews and focus groups with social workers and financial care counselors. Interview guides were used to elicit feedback from study participants pertaining to the types of financial problems that their patients were experiencing, the process for addressing these issues, patient assistance resources, and access barriers. Results: Four interviews and two focus group sessions (n = 15) were conducted in which four themes emerged among the social work and financial care counselor samples. Participants cited (1) frustration over the lack of financial resources and increasingly stringent eligibility criteria, (2) barriers to providing assistance such as process inefficiencies, (3) limited resources to identify at- risk patients and refer them for services, and (4) inadequate insurance coverage and availability. To bridge the gap between increasing patient need and limited resources, participants suggested development of interventions designed to aid in patient screening and resource identification. Conclusions: Oncology social workers and financial care counselors reported inadequate financial resources and faced barriers to matching appropriate resources with patients in need. Limited social work resources hindered early screening for financial distress. Interventions that focus on screening for early identification of financial distress and identification of resources are needed. Copyright © 2014 by American Society of Clinical Oncology."

In spite of a high level of enthusiasm and effort, the pilot did not succeed in its goal to implement bundled payment for orthopedic procedures across multiple payers and hospital-physician partners. An evaluation of the pilot documented a number of barriers, such as administrative burden, state regulatory uncertainty, and disagreements about bundle definition and assumption of risk. Ultimately, few contracts were signed, which resulted in insufficient volume to test hypotheses about the impact of bundled payment on quality and costs. Although bundled payment failed to gain a foothold in California, the evaluation provides lessons for future bundled payment initiatives. © 2014 by Project HOPE - The People-to-People Health Foundation."

As a consequence, framing also distracts our attention away from other issues. Over time, health care has used various frames to explain its activities. This paper traces the emergence of various health care frames since the 1850s to better understand how we reached current ways of thinking and practicing. Results and Conclusions The succession of the most prominent frames can be summarized as: medicine as a social science; the germ theory of disease; health care as a battleground (or the war metaphor); managing health care resources (or the market metaphor); Health for All (the social justice model); evidence-based medicine; and Obama Care. The focus of these frames is causal, instrumental, political/economic or social in nature. All remain relevant; however, recycling individual past frames in response to current problems will not achieve the outcomes we seek. Placing the individual and his/her needs at the centre (the attractor for the health system) of our thinking, as emphasized by the World Health Organization's International Classification of Function framework and the European Society of Person Centered Health Care, may provide the frame to refocus health and health care as interdependent experiences across individual, community and societal domains. Shifting beyond the entrenched instrumental and economic thinking will be challenging but necessary for the sake of patients, health professionals, society and the economy. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

Specialty pharmaceuticals are high-cost medications that treat complex, chronic, rare, and difficult-to-manage conditions. These drugs require special drug handling, appropriate clinical outcomes monitoring, and effective cost controls. The primary scope of this article is to discuss various strategies being implemented for specialty pharmaceutical utilization and cost management and correlated outcomes in the USA; these outcomes include enhanced health insurance plan benefit designs with formulary modifications and greater patient cost burden. Additional methods to manage specialty pharmaceuticals include the use of specialty pharmacies for drug distribution, increased emphasis on coordination of care and evidence-based medicine, as well as healthcare reform and regulations. Healthcare spending, both in the US and globally, continues to increase, with a rising proportion of drug spend towards specialty pharmaceuticals. Continued specialty pharmaceutical innovation and introduction of biosimilar products will evolve the currently utilized management strategies for these drugs. © 2014, The Author(s)."

This article examines strategies that these purchasers and payers can pursue to combat provider leverage to increase prices. It also examines opportunities for governments to either support or constrain these strategies. In response to higher prices, payers are developing new approaches to benefit and network design, some of which may be effective in moderating prices and, in some cases, volume. These approaches interact with public policy because regulation can either facilitate or constrain them. Federal and state governments also have opportunities to limit consolidation's effect on prices by developing antitrust policies that better address current market environments and by fostering the development of physician organizations that can increase competition and contract with payers under shared-savings approaches. The success of these private- and public-sector initiatives likely will determine whether governments shift from supporting competition to directly regulating payment rates. © 2014 Project HOPE-The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc."

This paper describes the experience of a collaborative alliance of health care providers in a large metropolitan area who develop a conceptual and mathematical decision model to guide decisions on expanding its network of community health clinics.Design/methodology/approach-Community stakeholders participated in a collaborative process that defined constructs they deemed important in guiding decisions on the location of community health clinics. This collaboration also defined key variables within each construct. Scores for variables within each construct were then totaled and weighted into a community-specific optimal space planning equation. This analysis relied entirely on secondary data available from published sources.Findings-The model built from this collaboration revolved around the constructs of demand, sustainability, and competition. It used publicly available data defining variables within each construct to arrive at an optimal location that maximized demand and sustainability and minimized competition.Practical implications-This is a model that safety net clinic planners and community stakeholders can use to analyze demographic and utilization data to optimize capacity expansion to serve uninsured and Medicaid populations.Originality/value-Communities can use this innovative model to develop a locally relevant clinic location-planning framework.

However, no studies to date have empirically and longitudinally studied how changes in a community's level of insurance coverage, a key determinant of access, affect ED utilization. OBJECTIVE:: To determine the effects of changes in a community's rate of insurance coverage on its population's ED use. METHODS:: We conducted a longitudinal analysis of all California counties between 2005 and 2010 using comprehensive ED visit data from the California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development. Using Poisson regression with county and year fixed effects, we determined how changes in the rate of insurance coverage within a given county affect ED visits per 1000 residents. RESULTS:: We found that changes in the rate of insurance coverage within a county had a slight but significant inverse relationship with ED visits per 1000 residents for both adults and children. For example, if a county's rate of insurance coverage among adults jumped from the 10th (73.22%) to the 90th percentile (84.93%), an estimated 2 fewer ED visits would occur per 1000 adult residents. CONCLUSIONS:: As the rate of insurance coverage increased within California counties, overall ED utilization declined only slightly. Thus, expanding insurance coverage may not lead to significant decreases in overall ED use. © 2014 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins."

Despite the rise of the Tea Party, and the racialization of health care politics, opinion dynamics are remarkably similar in both periods. Party IDis the single most powerful predictor of support for reform and the president's handling of it. Contrary to prominent claims, after controlling for partisanship, demographic characteristics are at best weak predictors of support for reform. We also show that Clinton and Obama did not ""lose""blacks, seniors, or wealthy voters over the course of the debate. The small and often nonexistent relationship between these characteristics and support for the plan are constant over time. Instead, the modest fluctuations in support for reform appear to follow the ebb and flow of elite rhetoric. Both mean levels of support and its volatility over time covary with elite partisan discourse. These findings suggest that presidents courting public opinion should seek consensus among their own party's elites before appealing to other narrower interests. © 2014 by Duke University Press."

The current consensus is that the solution to all three lies in changing financial incentives for providers and delivering care through integrated systems. The currently favored vehicle for this, both in the public and private sectors, is through Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs). Medicare has several models and has fostered rapid growth in the number of operative ACOs. At least an equal number of private ACOs are in operation. Whether or not these organizations will fulfill their promise is unknown but there is reason for cautious optimism. Allergists can and should be part of the process of this transformation in our health care system. They can be integral to helping these organizations save money by reducing hospitalizations and improving the quality of allergy and asthma care in the populations served.

Methods: We conducted a concurrent mixed method study of Medicaid and CHIP enrollees in a southern state. We conducted focus groups to identify enrollee concerns regarding the current application process and their IT proficiency. Additionally, we surveyed beneficiaries via telephone about their access to and use of the Internet, and willingness to adopt IT-enabled processes. 2013 households completed the survey. We used χ2 analysis for comparisons across different groups of respondents. Results: A majority of enrollees will embrace IT-enabled enrollment, but a small yet significant group continues to lack access to facilitating technologies. Moreover, a segment of beneficiaries in the two programs continues to place a high value on personal interactions with program caseworkers. Discussion: IT holds the promise of improving efficiency and reducing barriers for enrollees, but state and federal agencies managing public insurance programs need to ensure access to traditional processes and make caseworkers available to those who require and value such assistance, even after implementing IT-enabled processes. Conclusions: The use of IT-enabled processes is essential for effectively managing eligibility and enrollment determinations for public programs and private plans offered through state or federally operated exchanges. However, state and federal officials should be cognizant of the technological readiness of recipients and provide offline help to ensure broad participation in the insurance market."

One of the driving forces will be conversion of the current payment structure from a fee-for-service model to value-based payments.

The objective of this study is to investigate a possible link to worse outcomes in patients without insurance who undergo an emergent operation. Methods A retrospective cross-sectional analysis was performed using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) 2005-2011 dataset. Patients who underwent biliary, hernia, and colorectal operations were evaluated. Multivariate analyses were performed to assess the associations between insurance status, urgency of operation, and outcome. Covariates of age, sex, race, and comorbidities were controlled. Results The uninsured group had greatest odds ratios of undergoing emergent operative management in biliary (OR 2.43), colorectal (3.54), and hernia (3.95) operations, P <.001. Emergent operation was most likely in the 25- to 34-year age bracket, black and Hispanic patients, men, and patients with at least one comorbidity. Postoperative complications in emergencies, however, were appreciated most frequently in the populations with government coverage. Conclusion Although the uninsured more frequently underwent emergent operations, patients with coverage through the government had more complications in most categories investigated. Young patients also carried significant risk of emergent operations with increased complication rates. Patients with government insurance tended toward worse outcomes, suggesting disparity for programs such as Medicaid. Disparity related to payor status implies need for policy revisions for equivalent health care access. © 2014 Mosby, Inc. All rights reserved."

We find that governors’ partisanship and the composition of the legislature have substantively meaningful effects on governors’ decisions, but the level of need in the state exerts little effect on governors’ decisions.

This paper quantifies the effects of these eligibility expansions within the context of the 2010 Affordable Care Act. I construct a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model with indivisible labor supply expanded to include an endogenous household choice of health insurance coverage and calibrate it to U.S. data. I establish that changes in the distribution of labor and welfare associated with removal of asset testing are driven by exit of high productivity and high wealth households from the labor market. I then expand my analysis to the 2010 Affordable Care Act to demonstrate that removal of asset testing is critical to the obtained results even when combined with other provisions of the Act. Finally, I find that a simple asset test for eligibility of health insurance transfers undoes the distortion to the household labor supply decision among high productivity types. These results are robust to the introduction of employer premium contributions, an independent health insurance market, and idiosyncratic shocks to eligibility for employment-based health insurance. © 2014."

Total healthcare spending is on the rise without having a corresponding better health outcome. As such, with the growing role of government in healthcare, measuring and demonstrating value is beginning to expand beyond the private sector to metrics applied in the public sector. A modern approach to comparative effective research began its rapid rise in the USA when the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 allocated $1.1 billion for CER. This paper analyzes the implication and impact on the pharmaceutical industry. Design/methodology/approach – The paper reviews the basic definitions of CER and its areas of strength and weakness. It used real examples of drugs to show the impact of the Reinvestment Act of 2009 on the rise of orphan drugs. Findings – The study shows that the act encouraged the development of orphan drugs, mainly because of the low budget impact due to a smaller patient base. Provisions of the Affordable Care Act provide incentives for such rare disease indications, as no one can be denied coverage with pre-existing conditions. Research limitations/implications – The study is limited by the number of available rare drugs and the ongoing process of implementation of the Affordable Care Act. Practical implications – The study shows the cost-effective method of treating medical conditions. Social implications – Development of orphan drugs opens up access to care for many patients at a cost-effective price. Originality/value – This paper shows the link between the CER and the interest in developing drugs for rare disease by the pharmaceutical industry. It also brings out the possible implication of the Affordable Care Act on the pharmaceutical industry with respect to its strategies for drug development and drug portfolio. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

Methods: In urology the acronyms BPH (benign prostatic hyperplasia), ED (erectile dysfunction), IC (interstitial cystitis) and AUR (acute urinary retention) are examples with which we are all familiar. Today we use acronyms to describe the organizational and structural aspects of medicine. Results: The 2 most recent medical acronyms are PPACA (Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act) and ACO (accountable care organization). Now a new acronym, PCMH (patient centered medical home), is looming on the horizon. This article defines patient centered medical home, discusses its purpose and finally attempts to predict its impact on clinical urological practices.

The number of outpatient procedures has risen dramatically since 1981, and the majority of surgeries performed in the United States now take place in outpatient settings. Using data on procedure length, we show that ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs) provide a lower-cost alternative to hospitals as venues for outpatient surgeries. On average, procedures performed in ASCs take 31.8 fewer minutes than those performed in hospitals-a 25 percent difference relative to the mean procedure time. Given the rapid growth in the number of surgeries performed in ASCs in recent years, our findings suggest that ASCs provide an efficient way to meet future growth in demand for outpatient surgeries and can help fulfill the Affordable Care Act's goals of reducing costs while improving the quality of health care delivery. © 2014 Project HOPE."

Insurance data were prospectively collected and used in multivariate analysis to determine risk of perioperative complications.Objective: Given the negative financial impact of surgical site infections (SSIs) and the higher overall complication rates of patients with a Medicaid payer status, we hypothesized that a Medicaid payer status would have a significantly higher SSI rate.Summary of Background Data: The medical literature demonstrates lesser outcomes and increased complication rates in patients who have public insurance than those who have private insurance. No one has shown that patients with a Medicaid payer status compared with Medicare and privately insured patients have a significantly increased SSI rate for spine surgery.Methods: The prospectively collected Spine End Results Registry provided data for analysis. SSI was defined as treatment requiring operative debridement. Demographic, social, medical, and the surgical severity index risk factors were assessed against the exposure of payer status for the surgical procedure.Results: The population included Medicare (N = 354), Medicaid (N = 334), the Veterans' Administration (N = 39), private insurers (N = 603), and self-pay (N = 42). Those patients whose insurer was Medicaid had a 2.06 odds (95% confidence interval: 1.19-3.58, P = 0.01) of having a SSI compared with the privately insured.Conclusion: The study highlights the increased cost of spine surgical procedures for patients with a Medicaid payer status with the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010.

FINDINGS/CONCLUSIONS:: In the United States, over 50% of hospitalized patients older than 65 years with congestive heart failure are readmitted within 6 months of their hospital discharge. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, commonly called Obamacare, was signed into law in 2010 and effective 2012 the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) began the Readmissions Reduction Program, which requires the CMS to reduce payments to inpatient prospective payment system hospitals with excess readmissions. An estimated total of 2,217 hospitals across the nation will be penalized a percentage of their base Medicare reimbursements. Provisions of the Affordable Care Act that increase hospital's financial accountability for preventable readmissions have made it imperative to identify interventions that reduce hospital readmissions for patients with heart failure. Current evidence suggests that improving transition of care through intense repetitive education reduces hospital readmissions for heart failure by: IMPLICATIONS FOR CASE MANAGEMENT PRACTICE:: Case managers are faced with an ever-changing health care climate, including the demands of hospital readmission prevention. Because of this, case managers are in a unique position to ensure that the patient has a good understanding of their disease, medications, and follow-up instructions. One of the most effective ways to accomplish this is to be sure that every patient is assessed for discharge planning purposes and receives specific and consistent education throughout the care continuum, including follow-up care.

Two bills were used to create the health reform law when Democrats lost the majority needed in the Senate to pass a negotiated version of health reform that could avoid the use of the Senate filibuster by Republicans who opposed the bill. The ACA includes ten major titles and hundreds of provisions. Provisions include an expansion of health insurance coverage for individuals and small groups who lack access to affordable as well as substantial reforms of insurance practices in those markets, including prohibitions on denials of coverage based on preexisting conditions, charging women higher premiums than men, and charging elderly consumers more than three times premiums offered to younger consumers. In addition to coverage, the law devotes the most attention to reforming the healthcare delivery system. Almost 70 % of the pages and provisions in the law are related to the healthcare delivery. While quantity does not measure impact, in this case it reflects an intentional effort by Congress to focus on improving the delivery of care. ACA uses a distinct approach to delivery system reform with three notable features: (1) makes improving the quality and safety of care, rather than cost savings, the primary goal of delivery reform, (2) redirects Medicare and Medicaid payments away from pure fee for service and toward value-based care, and (3) seeks to make delivery system reform self-sustaining. What might have the health reform law included compared to what Congress passed? Probably a much scaled-down version that only extended coverage to children. Such a bill may have garnered some Republican support and have been easier to pass. But it would likely have neglected all or most of the delivery system reforms that seek to improve care for all patients in the USA. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014."

We sought to determine whether severe psychological distress (SPD) and serious mental illnesses (SMIs) are associated with a specific set of chronic medical conditions (CMCs) and the association between SPD-SMIs and increasing levels of medical multimorbidity and complexity (i.e., from 1 to 3 or more CMCs).Methods. We used data from 3 administrations (2008-2010) of the National Survey on Drug Use and Health collected from 110 455 adult participants. We used binary and ordinal logistic regressions adjusting for sociodemographics and substance abuse to examine the associations between SPD-SMIs and increasing levels of multimorbidity.Results. SPD-SMI was associated with higher probabilities for many CMCs generally, but we found no specific pattern for any class of conditions for SPD- SMIs and multimorbidity. The association between SPD-SMIs and multimorbidity strengthened as the number of CMCs increased.Conclusions.

The increase will depend, at least in part, on the complexity of the application process. To facilitate access, the ACA streamlined the application process for subsidized coverage; however, this did not include disability-based coverage. This article analyzes and describes the application process, identifies complexities, and defines steps to reduce complexities. The following application complexities were identified: (a) the need for applicants to apply separately for cash assistance and subsidized coverage, (b) the need for applicants to determine whether to pursue a disability-based Medicaid determination, and (c) the absence of a way for persons to self-identify their disability on the streamlined paper application form. The analysis indicates that the application process for subsidized coverage is complex and may hinder access among persons with disabilities. We identified operational steps that states and the federal government can take to reduce the complexities and improve access. © 2015, Hammill Institute on Disabilities 2015."

This article provides evidence on the stability of nongroup coverage using US census data for the period 2008-11, before ACA provisions took effect. The principal findings are threefold. First, this market was characterized by high turnover: Only 42 percent of people with nongroup coverage at the outset of the study period retained that coverage after twelve months. Second, 80 percent of people experiencing coverage changes acquired other insurance within a year, most commonly from an employer. Third, turnover varied across groups, with stable coverage more common for whites and self-employed people than for other groups. Turnover was particularly high among adults ages 19-35, with only 21 percent of young adults retaining continuous nongroup coverage for two years. Given estimates from 2012 that 10.8 million people were covered in this market, these results suggest that 6.2 million people leave nongroup coverage annually. This suggests that the nongroup market was characterized by frequent disruptions in coverage before the ACA and that the effects of the recent cancellations are not necessarily out of the norm. These results can serve as a useful pre-ACA baseline with which to evaluate the law's long-term impact on the stability of nongroup coverage. © 2014 Project HOPE."

This study investigates whether readmission penalties under HRRP impose significant reputational effects on hospitals. Data extracted from 2012 to 2013 news stories suggest that the higher the actual penalty, the higher the perceived cost of the penalty, the more likely it is that hospitals will state they have no control over the low-income patients they serve or that they will describe themselves as safety net providers. The downside of being singled out as a low-quality hospital deserving a relatively high penalty seems to be larger than the upside of being singled out as a high-quality hospital facing a relatively low penalty. Although the financial burden of the penalties seems to be low, hospitals may be reacting to the fact that information about excess readmissions and readmission penalties is being released widely and is scrutinized by the news media and the general public. © The Author(s) 2014."

To identify how specialty care can be improved, we mapped current U.S. health care utilization in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) using a national insurance claims database. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional study analyzing U.S. health care utilization in 964,633 patients with IBD between 2010 and 2012 using insurance claims data, including pharmacy and medical claims. Frequency of IBD-related care utilization (medication, tests, and treatments) and their charges were evaluated. Subsequently, outcomes were put into the framework of current U.S. guidelines to identify areas of improvement. Results: A disproportionate usage of aminosalicylates in Crohn's disease (42%), frequent corticosteroid use (46%, with 9% long-term users), and low rates of corticosteroid-sparing drugs (thiopurines 15%; methotrexate 2.7%) were observed. Markers for inflammatory activity, such as C-reactive protein or fecal calprotectin were not commonly used (8.8% and 0.13%, respectively). Although infrequently used (11%), anti-TNF antibody therapy represents a major part of observed IBD charges. Conclusions: This analysis shows 2010-2012 utilization and medication patterns of IBD health care in the United States and suggests that improvement can be obtained through enhanced guidelines adherence.

In such cases, reform may be implemented if lower-status workers fill in the gaps in the division of labor between the professions targeted by the reform, playing a brokerage role by protecting each profession’s information, meanings, and tasks in everyday work. When the new tasks represent professionally ill-defined problems, brokers can be more effective if they use buffering practices rather than connecting practices—managing information rather than transferring it, matching meanings rather than translating them, and maintaining interests rather than transforming them—to accomplish reform. By playing a buffering role in the interstices between existing professional jurisdictions, lower-status workers can carve out their own jurisdiction, becoming a brokerage profession between existing professions that need to collaborate with one another for reform to occur. © American Sociological Association 2014."

CHA's strategies include care redesign, financial realignment, workforce transformation, and development of external partnerships. Early results show some improvement in access, patient experience, quality, and utilization; however, the potential efficiencies will not eliminate CHA's current operating deficit.

In the years to come, ACOs will likely focus more on surgical care. Some ACOs have the ability to affect surgical practice patterns through referral pressures, but local market conditions may limit ACOs' abilities to alter surgeons' behavior.

Methods: We estimated the probability of being enrolled in VA, private insurance, and Medicaid before and after healthcare reform, using multivariate probit models while adjusting for individual characteristics. Using a difference-in-difference approach, we compared pre-post changes in enrollment probability among Massachusetts and non-Massachusetts veterans, respectively. Results: Compared with other New England veterans, Massachusetts veterans decreased their enrollment in VA and private insurance by 0.2 (P = .857) and 0.9 (P = .666) percentage points, respectively, following health reform. In contrast, Medicaid enrollment increased by 2.5 percentage points (P = .038).

Annual specialty drug spending per beneficiary who used specialty drugs increased considerably during the study period, from $2,641 to $8,976. However, specialty drugs accounted for only 6.7 percent of total drug spending per beneficiary in 2007 and 9.1 percent in 2011. Moreover, in 2011 cost-sharing reductions under the Affordable Care Act significantly reduced specialty drug users' out-of-pocket burden, which decreased 26 percent from 2010. Oral cancer agents accounted for a significant proportion of the increase in specialty drug spending among the study population. This suggests that the migration of specialty drug coverage from Medicare's Part B medical benefit to the Part D pharmacy benefit because of new treatment options may play an important role in specialty pharmacy trends. This shift is likely to continue as pharmaceutical innovations enable more specialty therapeutics to be selfadministered and to be covered under the pharmacy instead of the medical benefit. ©2014 Project HOPE-The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc."

Health-care costs now approach a fifth of the economy, and careful reviews suggest that a significant portion of those costs does not lead to better health or better care.

The business side of medicine is enough to make most emergency physicians’ eyes glaze over and tune out. The practice of emergency medicine is what drew most physicians to this field. However, in an environment where health care is consuming an ever-increasing share of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and the US is spending close to double the amount of money per capita than the next industrialized nation without substantial improvement in health care outcomes [1], the emergency physician must understand the impact health care reform efforts will have on emergency medicine practice. This chapter will focus on the financial issues particular to geriatric emergency medicine: how geriatric care is financed, the many parts of Medicare, US and geriatric population demographics, EMTALA and the Affordable Care Act. The majority of industrialized nations pay for health care through a government-financed system based on tax collections. The US finances health care through a market-based system of charging employers and employees for private health care coverage.

CHCs also have an increasingly important educational role to train clinicians who will remain to practice in community clinics. CHCs and Area Health Education Centers (AHECs) are logical partners to prepare the health workforce for the future. Both are sponsored by the Health Resources and Services Administration, and they share a mission to improve quality of care in medically underserved communities. AHECs emphasize the educational side of the mission, and CHCs the service side. Building stronger partnerships between them can facilitate a balance between education and service needs. From 2004 to 2011, the California Statewide AHEC program and its 12 community AHECs (centers) reorganized to align training with CHC workforce priorities. Eight centers merged into CHC consortia; others established close partnerships with CHCs in their respective regions. The authors discuss issues considered and approaches taken to make these changes. Collaborative innovative processes with program leadership, staff, and center directors revised the program mission, developed common training objectives with an evaluation plan, and defined organizational, functional, and impact characteristics for successful AHECs in California. During this planning, centers gained confidence as educational arms for the safety net and began collaborations with statewide programs as well as among themselves. The AHEC reorganization and the processes used to develop, strengthen, and identify standards for centers forged the development of new partnerships and established academic-community trust in planning and implementing programs with CHCs."

The initiative, which is based on the implementation of seven best practices, has succeeded in part by improving care coordination and by linking EDs across the state so information can be shared electronically. Leaders of the effort concede that while state pressure was essential in pushing providers to address excess use of the ED for nonemergency needs, they stress that the approach worked because all sides were willing to sit down and hammer out a solution. Further, they note that the infrastructure is now in place to address other problems in a similar fashion. An analysis of claims data shows that in the first year of the initiative, ED visits by Medicaid recipients declined by 9.9%, and the rate of visits by frequent ED utilizers declined by 10.7%. The analysis also shows that ED visits resulting in a scheduled drug prescription fell by 24%, and the rate of visits for a low-acuity diagnosis declined by 14.2%. While many EDs had to adjust their staffing and other resources to accommodate reduced volumes, others experienced few changes or even saw an uptick in volume, possibly from implementation of the Affordable Care Act.

It was guided by principles that nearly match those that guided the creation of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Like the ACA, TennCare used corporations, rather than a single government payer, to implement the plan, and it relied on a mix of managed care, market competition, and government regulation.While many states cut back on their Medicaid enrollments from 1993 to 2001, TennCare grew from 750,000 to 1.47 million enrollees. The state was less successful in controlling costs, however.

We examined older jail inmates' predetainment acute care use (emergency department or hospitalization in the 3 months before arrest) and their plans for using acute care after release. Methods. We performed a cross-sectional study of 247 jail inmates aged 55 years or older assessing sociodemographic characteristics, health, and geriatric conditions associated with predetainment and anticipated postrelease acute care use. Results. We found that 52% of older inmates reported predetainment acute care use and 47% planned to use the emergency department after release. In modified Poisson regression, homelessness was independently associated with predetainment use (relative risk = 1.42; 95% confidence interval = 1.10, 1.83) and having a primary care provider was inversely associated with planned use (relative risk = 0.69; 95% confidence interval = 0.53, 0.89). Conclusions. The Affordable Care Act has expanded Medicaid eligibility to all persons leaving jail in an effort to decrease postrelease acute care use in this high-risk population. Jail-to-community transitional care models that address the health, geriatric, and social factors prevalent in older adults leaving jail, and that focus on linkages to housing and primary care, are needed to enhance the impact of the act on acute care use for this population."

The Court's reasoning seems to be that once a court has found that one provision or application of a statute is unconstitutional and invalid, it then must decide how much of the statute should be made inoperative through the application of the remedy of invalidation. Aspects of a statute that are constitutionally unobjectionable but inseverable should be made ineffective, while those that are severable should not be eliminated. On the basis of this reasoning, four Justices were prepared to hold that the entire Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was inoperative because inseverable from unconstitutional components. Those Justices would have reached that conclusion even though no party before the Court had shown that it was burdened by any of the allegedly inseverable provisions. Understanding invalidation for inseverability as a remedy for unconstitutionality facilitated that departure from the Court's ordinary principles of standing, as it has facilitated departure from ordinary principles of constitutional avoidance. Invalidation, however, is a remedy only figuratively, not literally. The Constitution, not any judicial decree, produces invalidity.

Methods SLIV clinics were conducted in 19 elementary schools in the Denver Public School district (September 2010 to February 2011). School personnel obtained parental consent, and a community vaccinator conducted clinics and performed billing. Vaccines For Children vaccine was available for eligible students. Parents were not billed for any fees. Data were collected regarding implementation costs and vaccine cost was calculated using published private sector prices. Reimbursement amounts were compared to costs. Results Overall, 30% of students (2784 of 9295) received ¥1 influenza vaccine; 39% (1079 of 2784) needed 2 doses and 80% received both.

Under the Affordable Care Act, the USPSTF recommendation requires commercial insurers to fully cover low-dose CT. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is now considering whether to also offer coverage for Medicare beneficiaries. Although the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) demonstrated the efficacy of low-dose CT, implementation of national screening may be premature. The magnitude of benefit from routine screening is uncertain; estimates are based on data from a single study and simulation models commissioned by the USPSTF. The potential harms-which could affect a large population-include false-positive results, anxiety, radiation exposure, diagnostic workups, and the resulting complications. It is unclear if routine screening would result in net benefit or net harm. The NLSTmay not be generalizable to a national screening program for the Medicare age group because 73%of NLST participants were younger than 65 years. Moreover, screening outside of trial conditions is less likely to be restricted to high-risk smokers and qualified imaging centers with responsible referral protocols. Until better data are available for older adults who are screened in ordinary (nontrial) community settings, CMS should postpone coverage of low-dose CT screening for Medicare beneficiaries.

The 30-day readmission rate is a quality metric under the Affordable Care Act. Readmission rates after thyroidectomy and parathyroidectomy and associated factors remain ill-defined. We evaluated patient and perioperative factors for association with readmission after thyroidectomy and parathyroidectomy. Methods. The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Participant Use File (2011) data for thyroid (n = 3,711) and parathyroid (n = 3,358) resections were analyzed. Patient- and operation-related factors were assessed by univariate and multivariate analyses. Results. Among 7,069 patients, 30-day readmission rate was 4.0%: 4.1% after thyroidectomy and 3.8% after parathyroidectomy. Significant associations for 30-day readmission included declining functional status (odds ratio [OR], 6.4-10.1), preoperative hemodialysis (OR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.5-4.7), malnutrition (OR, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.2-10.1), increasing American Society of Anesthesiologists class (OR 1.3-4.7), unplanned reoperation (OR, 61.6), and length of stay (LOS) <24 hours (OR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.45-0.85; all P <.05).

Health care systems currently offset lower Medicaid reimbursement through higher payers. The ability to ""cost shift"" will be diminished as the Medicaid population increases. Study Design A financial cost and revenue analysis of outpatient laparoscopic cholecystectomy at our institution was performed. Cost was defined as actual expense to the health care institution. Fixed and variable costs were identified to calculate a break-even point. Time spent from check in to dismissal was based on historic averages. When actual costs could not be pinpointed, estimates from industry experts were used. Reimbursement included surgeon and anesthesia professional fees and facility fees. Results A total of 501 laparoscopic cholecystectomies were performed at the main operating room facility in 2012. Annual fixed costs were $252,637. Variable costs were $1,860/case. Personnel and single-use equipment made the largest contribution to variable costs. Reimbursement for professional and facility fees totaled $2,444/case. The break-even point occurred at 454 cases. Based on historic volume, the break-even point for the calendar year would occur on November 27. Conclusions Our analysis demonstrates that laparoscopic cholecystectomy can be performed with a positive margin at Medicaid reimbursement rates with sufficient volume. The minimal margin, however, could substantially limit the ability of lower-volume hospitals to provide these services and negatively impact access to care in this patient population. © 2014 by the American College of Surgeons."

While many observers have questioned the expansive interpretation of statutory and regulatory authority that undergirds RTTT-and the NCLB waiver process-there is little doubt that the efforts have had a significant impact on the national political discourse around education and pushed many states to propose or enact important policy changes, particularly around charter schools, common core standards, and teacher evaluation processes. Along with health care, education reform is likely to be remembered as the most significant policy legacy of the Obama administration. However, while the Affordable Care Act was drafted by Congress and secured through the ""normal"" legislative process, the Obama education agenda has largely been designed and enacted through unilateral executive branch authority.

On June 28th, the Supreme Court handed down a ruling on the legal basis of certain key provisions of the new law. Speculation and prognostication on how the court would rule was widespread but often inaccurate. The court upheld the constitutionality of Congress’ power to enact the individual mandate, although the Justices were divided in their rationale. In a surprising decision, the court ruled that the Federal government may not set terms for the ACA Medicaid expansion that would tie a state’s decision to expand to a total loss of Medicaid funds. Within a few months of the Supreme Court ruling, the 2012 Presidential election tested the fate of the ACA yet again. When Congress undertakes major policy innovation, as in the ACA, the fate of its decisions remains somewhat uncertain as the courts or future Congress can overturn them. Despite uncertainty, Congress passes laws anyway, knowing that no law is perfect or immune from change. Continued controversy over the ACA reflects not only recent disagreements over the law but a long-standing dispute over the goal of providing universal or near-universal coverage in the USA that has been over 100 years in the making. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014."

People in underserved racial and ethnic groups who also have a disability may experience a complex mix of health care advantages and disparities. However, little is known about this intersection.Objective: To determine how disability status, combined with membership in an underserved racial or ethnic group, is associated with having a USC and unmet health care needs.Methods: We conducted multivariate regression analyses of 2002-2010 data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, focused on working age adults (18-64 y).Results: Although most racial and ethnic groups were less likely to have a USC than non-Hispanic whites, people with disabilities were more likely to have a USC; Hispanics with basic activity limitations were the only disability group with elevated odds of lacking a USC. Conversely, disability was strongly associated with unmet health care needs, but we did not find inflated impacts of both having a disability and belonging to an underserved racial or ethnic group.Conclusions: We found limited evidence of interaction or additive effects of disability and race/ethnicity but did confirm separate disparities for each. Ongoing research is needed to track both disability- related and racial/ethnic disparities, to determine whether increased insurance coverage, provider training, care coordination, and other efforts under the Affordable Care Act lead to reductions in disparities.

CHCs have struggled to recruit and retain qualified physicians. Objective: To understand physicians' work experiences in CHCs and identify major sources of satisfaction and dissatisfaction. Methods: Using purposeful sampling, we conducted semistructured interviews with 12 family physicians practicing in CHCs. Interview questions assessed physicians' experiences in CHCs and sources of satisfaction and dissatisfaction. Interview notes were coded and analyzed by 2 investigators using a grounded theory approach to identify key themes. Results: Though family physicians feel tremendous satisfaction from care of underserved patients, they are frustrated with the overwhelming workload they experience. Family physicians also report poor administrative management while working in CHCs. Conclusions: Implementation of the Affordable Care Act, which relies on expansion of CHC services, may be adversely affected by family physicians' frustrations with CHC practice. Further research to explore and potentially improve the CHC work environment may be needed. © The Author(s) 2013."

These families offer an opportunity to examine the functioning of the contemporary state and its penetration at the household level. For many Latino youth, experiences are framed not only by their own but other family members’ legal status. This article reports on health care seeking experiences of mixed-status families in the Lower Rio Grande Valley of South Texas and the impact of the recent health care reform (Affordable Care Act). We utilized qualitative ethnographic methods including 55 semistructured interviews with mixed-status families and 43 interviews with health care providers, caseworkers, and public health officials. Results indicate that changes accompanying the reform directly and indirectly affect mixed-status households’ ability to access care. We describe strategies in times of illness, including those unique to border communities. We conclude that, for successful implementation of policies associated with health care reform, broader issues related to immigration status must be addressed, especially anxieties regarding future chances of regularization. These uniquely affect mixed-status families, create a ripple effect on all household members, and result in unintended consequences for U.S. citizen children. Implications point to the need for a pathway to citizenship for parents as a basic step in improving well-being of children. © 2014 SAGE Publications."

People with disabilities of all ages are increasing in prevalence, and the prevalence increases with age. People with disabilities are high users of health care, have less social participation, and have a higher risk for poverty. Although the United States has a robust history of policy and legislation related to disability and rehabilitation, the ratification of the United Nations Conventions on the Rights of People with Disabilities recently failed in the United States Congress. However, in general, the United States is positioned fairly well regarding most aspects of rehabilitation including a strong rehabilitation science providing a sound base for evidence-based practice. Three key areas of further development emerge: education about disability and benefits of rehabilitation to decision makers and administrators who are concerned with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, advocacy for a more robust organized presence and acknowledgement of rehabilitation science and research, and advocacy for education about disability and rehabilitation for physicians-in-training.

Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of all house staff at Yale-New Haven Hospital (YNHH) and the University of Connecticut Health Center (UCHC). We calculated means of Likert-scale attitude response scores and rankings of health policy priorities. We then performed linear regression of postgraduate year (PGY) and surgical specialty on health policy priorities. Results: We received back 308 surveys (response rate of 19%). One hundred thirty-five responses (44%) were from UCHC and 173 responses were from YNHH (56%). Eighty-nine percent agreed that health policy was important to them, but only 21% felt confident in their knowledge of health policy. Thirty-two percent felt they had a good understanding of the Affordable Care Act. In terms of health policy priorities, malpractice reform and future salary were ranked the highest. There was a statistically significant positive association between PGY and malpractice reform as well as a negative association with Medicaid expansion and PGY after adjusting for surgical specialty. Conclusion: House staff physicians feel that health policy is important to them, but they are not confident in their knowledge ofhealth policy. Malpractice reform and future salary are policy priorities for house staff, and malpractice reform is increasingly important to house staff as they advance through their postgraduate training."

Using a prospective cohort (n=104,375), we aimed to (1) determine characteristics of affected children, (2) describe effects on health insurance coverage and access to needed health care, and (3) model the causal relationship between this new policy, known determinants of health care access, and receipt of needed health care. METHODS: We identified a stratified random sample of children shortly after the DRA was implemented and used state records and surveys to compare three groups: children denied Medicaid for inability to document citizenship, children denied for other reasons, and children accepted for coverage. To combat survey nonresponse, we used Medicaid records to identify differences between responders and nonrespondents and created survey weights to account for these differences. Weighted simple and multivariable logistic regression described the complete, originally identified population. RESULTS: Children denied Medicaid for inability to document citizenship were likely to be US citizens, were medically and socially more vulnerable than their peers, and went on to have gaps in health insurance coverage and unmet health care needs. The DRA led to persistent loss of insurance coverage, which decreased access to needed health care. Having a usual source of care was an effect modifier in this relationship. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate the negative consequences of the DRA and support the use of automated methods of citizenship verification allowed under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act."

That's an exaggeration, of course, but it is the fundamental message our society sends when we tell him that, because he and his family are undocumented immigrants, we are unwilling to extend them access to affordable and reliable health insurance. One major shortcoming of the Affordable Care Act is its specific exclusion of the almost twelve million undocumented immigrants-including millions of children-in this country from access to the state and federal insurance exchanges where coverage can be purchased. It is true that providing undocumented immigrants access to the exchanges and subsidies mandated by the ACA would require additional funding. However, a recent analysis in California has found that the costs of expanding state-supported care to include undocumented immigrants would largely be offset by the increased state sales tax revenue paid by managed care organizations and by reduced spending at the county level on emergency-room and hospital care of the uninsured. © 2014 by The Hastings Center."

It builds on Harnack and French’s 2008 review and assesses the evidence on the effectiveness of calorie labeling at the point of purchase. We find that, while there are some positive results reported from studies examining the effects of calorie labeling, overall the best designed studies (real world studies, with a comparison group) show that calorie labels do not have the desired effect in reducing total calories ordered at the population level.

I focus on the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2011 which grants certain rights and protections to women seeking to combine lactation with wage-work. I argue that this policy represents a form of work–life integration that is particularly burdensome for working mothers, and that expectations relating to working motherhood in the contemporary US are being reshaped around the demands of neoliberalism, producing what I term ‘neoliberal motherhood’. I assert that this policy represents a way of combining wage-work and care-work that is not captured within existing conceptualisations, and suggest that a re-working of theory in this area is needed to address cases in which embodied care-work is enfolded within the time and space of wage-work. © The Author(s) 2014 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav."

The dependent variable was a principal diagnosis of dental caries. The primary independent variable was patient's area of residence, rural versus urban. The control variables were payer, age, gender, median income, region, and admission timing. Logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the association with residence, payer, and other covariates. Multivariate logistic regression models were estimated.Results In 2008, there were an estimated 74 million ED visits among working adults ages 19-64 in the United States. Dental caries accounted for between 0.2 percent and 1.0 percent of all visits, depending on patient characteristics. Rural patients were significantly more likely than urban patients to have dental visits. Dental visits were more prevalent among patient with government insurance or self-pay relative to the privately insured.Conclusions The Affordable Care Act may reduce the proportion of self-pay visits for dental care.

Despite these recommendations, physicians are not offering HIV testing routinely. We apply a model that has previously identified 3 central, inter-related factors (knowledge-, attitude-, and behavior-related barriers) for why physicians do not follow practice guidelines in order to better understand why physicians are not offering HIV testing routinely. This model frames our review of the existing literature on physician barriers to routine HIV testing. Within the model, knowledge barriers include lack of familiarity or awareness of clinical recommendations, attitude barriers include lack of agreement with guidelines, while behavioral barriers include external barriers related to the guidelines themselves, to patients, or to environmental factors. Our review reveals that many physicians face these barriers with regards to implementing routine HIV testing. Several factors underscore the importance of determining how to best address physician barriers to HIV testing, including: provisions of the Affordable Care Act that are likely to require or incentivize major payers to cover HIV testing, evidence which suggests that a physician's recommendation to test for HIV is a strong predictor of patient testing behavior, and data which reveals that nearly 20% of HIV-positive individuals may be unaware of their status.

Physicians in a wide variety of settings may benefit from understanding the RBRVS, including physicians who are employees, because many organizations use relative value units as productivity measures. Despite the complexity of the RBRVS, its logic and ideal are simple: In theory, the resource usage (comprising physician work, practice expense, and liability insurance premium costs) for one service is relative to the resource usage of all others. Ensuring relativity when new services are introduced or existing services are changed is, therefore, critical. Since the inception of the RBRVS, the American Medical Association's Relative Value Scale Update Committee (RUC) has made recommendations to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services on changes to relative value units. The RUC's core focus is to develop estimates of physician work, but work estimates also partly determine practice expense payments. Critics have attributed various health-care system problems, including declining and growing gaps between primary care and specialist incomes, to the RUC's role in the RBRVS update process. There are persistent concerns regarding the quality of data used in the process and the potential for services to be overvalued. The Affordable Care Act addresses some of these concerns by increasing payments to primary care physicians, requiring reevaluation of the data underlying work relative value units, and reviewing misvalued codes. © 2014 American College of Chest Physicians."

Six focus groups were conducted with educators, students, and their parents. The inclusion of parents was unusual in studies of this kind. The outcome yielded important and surprising differences between student and parent knowledge, attitudes and beliefs.

Yet should these employer practices constitute legally actionable discrimination? That question is the central inquiry of this Article. It begins by identifying those recently adopted policies as discrimination on the basis of employee health. It then analyzes this novel brand of employment discrimination by comparing employer bans on nicotine and obesity with the employment actions forbidden by the current federal statutes that cover health-related information, mainly the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Rehabilitation Act, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, and the Affordable Care Act. The Article distinguishes between discrimination on the basis of health-related traits and discrimination on the basis of health-related conduct. Because the current federal employment discrimination laws are uniformly trait-based, prohibiting employment policies related to nicotine use and weight requires a different kind of antidiscrimination statute. The Article then surveys existing state legislation that limits an employer's ability to discriminate on the basis of unhealthy behavior. It ends by proposing that well-structured legislation could reconcile the concerns surrounding this contentious issue, simultaneously shielding the interests of employers while offering workers protection."

This article provides a multi-institutional, multivariate analysis of the pre- and postoperative patient factors associated with readmission after carotid endarterectomy (CEA).Methods Using the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program from 2011, we considered 8456 patients. The primary outcome variable was 30-day unplanned readmission. Multiple logistic regression was used, and we controlled for preoperative demographic variables, comorbidities and clinical characteristics, and postoperative medical and surgical complications.Results Patients with CEA had a 6.0% unplanned readmission rate. The most common comorbidities in the readmitted patients included hypertension, diabetes, and bleeding disorder. Risk-adjusted multiple regression indicated that preoperative bleeding disorder (odds ratio [OR] 1.62), diabetes (OR 1.46), history of a cerebrovascular accident/stroke (OR 1.46), and increasing age (OR 1.01) were statistically significant predictors for readmission. Postoperatively, surgical-site infection (OR 21.90), myocardial infarction (OR 10.35), sepsis/septic shock (OR 7.79), cerebrovascular accident/stroke (OR 6.58), pneumonia (OR 4.37), and urinary tract infection (OR 3.21) were associated with a greater rate of readmission.Conclusions Readmission after CEA occurs at a comparatively high rate. Preoperative bleeding disorders, diabetes, cerebrovascular accidents, and age and postoperative surgical-site infection, myocardial infarction, sepsis/septic shock, pneumonia, and cerebrovascular accident were associated with readmission. These findings may help guide the surgical management of patients and prevent costly readmissions. © 2014 Elsevier Inc."

Furthermore, in many arenas, it was taboo for medical students, residents, and physicians to discuss the business and finances of their work for fear that it would interfere with their sacred duties as health care providers. There has been a substantial shift in this philosophy over the last few decades with the growth and evolution of the health care industry in the United States. In 2012, health care expenditures accounted for 17.2% of the United States Gross Domestic Product, averaging $8915 per person. The passage of the Affordable Care Act in March of 2010 sent a clear message to all that change is coming, and it is more important now than ever to have physician leaders whose skills and knowledge in business, management, and health care law rival their acumen within their medical practice. Students, residents, and fellows all express a desire to gain more business knowledge throughout their education and training, but many do not know where to begin or have access to programs that can further their knowledge. Whether you are an employed or private practice physician, academic or community based, improving your business intelligence will help you get a seat at the table where decisions are made and give you the skills to influence those decisions.

Studies have found that disparities in quality persist for certain racial/ethnic and socioeconomically disadvantaged groups; however, results are mixed with regard to insurance-based differences. The purpose of this study is to investigate the independent associations between type of health insurance coverage, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status (SES), and quality of care, as measured by benchmark indicators of diabetes-related primary care. This study used the Diabetes Care Survey of the 2010 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regressions were used to examine the association between quality of diabetes care and type of insurance coverage, race/ethnicity, and SES. Multivariate analyses also controlled for additional demographic and health status characteristics. Respondents with insurance coverage (particularly those with private insurance or with Medicare and Medicaid coverage) were more likely to receive quality diabetes care than uninsured individuals. Few significant disparities based on race/ethnicity or SES persisted in subsequent multivariate analyses. Findings suggest that insurance coverage may make the greatest impact in ensuring equitable distribution of quality diabetes care, regardless of race/ethnicity or socioeconomic status. With the implementation of Affordable Care Act under which more people could potentially gain access to insurance, policymakers should next track insurance-based diabetes care disparities. © 2013 The Author(s)."

We use new panel survey data from New York State to estimate residents' willingness to pay (WTP) to expand public insurance coverage. Using a nonparametric double-bounded contingent valuation (CV) approach, we specifically ask residents about their WTP to reduce the rate of uninsurance in the state. Our results imply an aggregate lower-bound WTP of over $2,800 per year to cover one person. We also analyze heterogeneity in WTP by sub-group and changes in individual WTP over time between 2008 and 2010. We find that a large majority of residents are willing to pay additional taxes to reduce the number of uninsured in the state, and that average WTP remained remarkably stable despite the economic downturn and the politically polarized discussions surrounding the Affordable Care Act. Decomposing the changes in individual WTP, we find that economic factors related to the recession, including changes in income and employment status, cannot explain changes in individual WTP, whereas individual changes in political opinions about health insurance reform between 2008 and 2010 are strongly correlated with changes in WTP. © 2014 Western Economic Association International."

Barriers to access or quality could hamper the program's success. One of these barriers might be the stigma associated with Medicaid or poverty. Methods Our mixed-methods study involved 574 low-income adults and included data from an in-person survey and follow-up interviews. Our analysis of the interviews showed that many participants who were on Medicaid or uninsured described a perception or fear of being treated poorly in the health care setting. We defined this experience as stigma and merged our qualitative interviews coded for stigma with our quantitative survey data to see whether stigma was related to other sociodemographic characteristics. We also examined whether stigma was associated with access to care, quality of care, and self-reported health. Findings We were unable to identify other sociodemographic characteristics associated with stigma in this low-income sample. The qualitative interviews suggested that stigma was most often the result of a provider-patient interaction that felt demeaning, rather than an internalized sense of shame related to receiving public insurance or charity care. An experience of stigma was associated with unmet health needs, poorer perceptions of quality of care, and worse health across several self-reported measures. Conclusions Because a stigmatizing experience in the health system might interfere with the delivery of high-quality care to new Medicaid enrollees, further research and policy interventions that target stigma are warranted. © 2014 Milbank Memorial Fund."

One of these areas is health information provision; in fact, public libraries were widely identified as institutions providing support for patrons with questions on the Affordable Care Act. Yet, not all public libraries are equipped to provide this type of support. Moreover, there seems to be an inherent tension between collecting popular literature that may provide dangerous misinformation with regard to health and access to high quality, authoritative resources. Collection development tools and policies aren't standardized across libraries, and often staff are not trained to provide health information. Researchers visited randomly selected public libraries in three eastern U.S. states and posing as a patron asked: do vaccines cause autism. Public library staff referred to print materials to answer the question in half of all visits; 69% of the time, the print resource did not provide a credible answer.

Study Design: Retrospective cross-sectional and retrospective cohort difference-in-difference. Methods: The survey responses of nondisabled, elderly Part D enrollees from the Health and Retirement Study were evaluated across 2 time periods: 2006 to 2008 and 2008 to 2010. This study estimated the proportion of Part D enrollees who reported switching plans and the probability of reported switching based on a set of baseline characteristics. Lastly, changes in annual OOP prescription costs from 2008 to 2010 were compared between self-reported switchers and nonswitchers. Results: In a nondisabled, elderly Medicare Part D population, 20.6% (±2.0%, 95% CI) reported switching between 2006 and 2008, and 23.4% (±1.7%) between 2008 and 2010.

To date, however, unplanned postoperative care remains poorly characterized, particularly for patients with kidney stones. Our objective was to describe the frequency, variation, and financial impact of unplanned, high-acuity, follow-up visits in the treatment of patients with urinary stone disease. Methods We identified privately insured patients undergoing percutaneous nephrostolithotomy, ureteroscopy, or shock-wave lithotripsy for stone disease. The primary outcome was occurrence of an emergency department visit or hospital admission within 30 days of the procedure. Multivariable models estimated the odds of an unplanned visit and the incremental cost of those visits, controlling for important covariates. Results We identified 93,523 initial procedures to fragment or remove stones. Overall, 1 in 7 patients had an unplanned postprocedural visit. Unplanned visits were least common after shock-wave lithotripsy (12%) and occurred with similar frequency after ureteroscopy and percutaneous nephrostolithotomy (15%). Procedures at high-volume facilities were substantially less likely to result in an unplanned visit (odds ratio 0.80, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 0.74-0.87, P <.001). When an unplanned visit occurred, adjusted incremental expenditures per episode were greater after shock-wave lithotripsy ($32,156 [95% CI $30,453-33,859]) than after ureteroscopy ($23,436 [95% CI $22,281-24,590]).

PPPM total healthcare expenditures were numerically lower for patients initiating preferred ART regimens (-$341; 95% CI, -$888 to $255) but the difference was not deemed significant. Conclusions: This study reinforces the value of HHS recommendations for first-line ART. The potential impact of these findings will grow as more HIV patients become Medicaid-eligible under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act."

This study aims to update and better assess the market for chemotherapy and radiation therapy and the impact of health reform on capacity of and demand for oncologists and radiation oncologists. Methods: The supply of oncologists and radiation oncologists, by age, sex, and specialty, was projected through 2025 with an input-output model. The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, commercial claims, and Medicare claims were analyzed to determine patterns of use by patient characteristics such as age, sex, health insurance coverage, cancer site, physician specialty, and service type. Patterns of use were then applied to the projected prevalence of cancer, using data from the SEER Program of the National Cancer Institute. Results: Beginning in 2012, 16,347 oncologists and radiation oncologists were active and supplying 15,190 full-time equivalents (FTEs) of patient care. Without consideration of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), overall demand for oncologist services is projected to grow 40% (21,255 FTEs), whereas supply may grow only 25% (18,997 FTEs), generating a shortage of 2,258 FTEs in 2025. When fully implemented, the ACA could increase the demand for oncologists and radiation oncologists by 500,000 visits per year, increasing the shortage to 2,393 FTEs in 2025. Conclusion: Anticipated shortages are largely consistent with the projections of the ASCO 2007 workforce study but somewhat more delayed. The ACA may modestly exacerbate the shortage. Unless oncologist productivity can be enhanced, the anticipated shortage will strain the ability to provide quality cancer care. Copyright © 2014 by American Society of Clinical Oncology."

With the population trend shifting to a higher volume of elderly adults, the efficient management of HF will become increasingly essential. The development and implementation of The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and subsequent changes in reimbursement practices have made 30-day readmission rates a topic of much interest and relevance. The aim of the study was to compare rates of readmission among teaching and nonteaching hospitals. Methods: The authors gathered retrospective data on HF quality measures and readmission rates between August 2011 and July 2012, extracted from the institution's managerial accounting database. These datawere compared among teaching and nonteaching hospitals. Patient demographics, readmission rates, readmission diagnoses, severity of illness, patient disposition, medications prescribed, cost of services, and mortality were reviewed. Analysis of variance was used for continuous variables; χ2 analysis was used for evaluating categorical variables. Results: A higher proportion of patients on the cardiology teaching service were men than on either the medicine teaching service or the medicine nonteaching service. Length of stay, case costs, and care costs were lowest for the cardiology teaching service; however, patient illness severity was lower on this service than on the other two services. Overall, readmissions and mortality were similar among all groups, but readmission for the same diagnosis was more likely on the cardiology service than on the medicine teaching and nonteaching services. Conclusions: Studies comparing teaching and nonteaching providers for an HF diagnosis are needed. Hospital readmission and mortality rates were similar across services and compared favorably with national data. Opportunities that target cost reduction and length of stay may be leveraged.

Integrated care supports continuity of care over time, with care that is coordinated within and between settings and is responsive to patients' needs. Currently, little is known about care integration for rural patients Copyright r 2014 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.Objective: To examine challenges to care integration in rural safety net clinics and strategies to address these challenges.Research Design: Qualitative case study.Participants: Thirty-six providers and staff from 3 rural clinics in the Safety Net Medical Home Initiative.Methods: Interviews were analyzed using the framework method with themes organized within 3 constructs: Team Coordination and Empanelment, External Coordination and Partnerships, and Patientcentered and Community-centered Care.Results: Participants described challenges common to safety net clinics, including limited access to specialists for Medicaid and uninsured patients, difficulty communicating with external providers, and payment models with limited support for care integration activities. Rurality compounded these challenges. Respondents reported benefits of empanelment and team-based care, and leveraged local resources to support care for patients. Rural clinics diversified roles within teams, shared responsibility for patient care, and colocated providers, as strategies to support care integration.Conclusions: Care integration was supported by 2 fundamental changes to organize and deliver care to patients-(1) empanelment with a designated group of patients being cared for by a provider; and (2) a multidisciplinary team able to address rural issues. New funding and organizational initiatives of the Affordable Care Act may help to further improve care integration, although additional solutions may be necessary to address particular needs of rural communities."

HPV prevalence decreased with age, from 10.3% among 30- to 39-year-olds to 4.5% among 50- to 60-year-olds. About 5% of the women had a combination of a positive HPV test and normal Pap test results; HPV 16/18 was identified in 14% of discordant women.Objective The primary cervical cancer screening strategy for women over age 30 is high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) testing combined with Papanicolaou (Pap) testing (cotesting) every 5 years. This combination strategy is a preventive service that is required by the Affordable Care Act to be covered with no cost-sharing by most health insurance plans. The cotesting recommendation was made based entirely on prospective data from an insured population that may have a lower proportion of women with HPV positive and Pap negative results (ie, discordant results). The discordant group represents a very difficult group to manage. If the frequency of discordant results among underserved women is higher, health care providers may perceive the cotesting strategy to be a less favorable screening strategy than traditional Pap testing every 3 years. Study Design The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Cervical Cancer Study was conducted at 15 clinics in 6 federally qualified health centers across Illinois. Providers at these clinics were given the option of cotesting for routine cervical cancer screening. Type-specific HPV detection was performed on residual extracts using linear array.Conclusion The rate of discordant results among underserved women was similar to those reported throughout the US in a variety of populations. Typing for HPV 16/18 appears to assist in the management in a small proportion of women with discordant results. © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

Tax exempt hospitals must perform a community health needs assessment (CHNA), similar to the community health assessment (CHA) required for LHDs. These efforts have led to a renewed interest in hospitals and LHDs working together to achieve common goals.Purpose: The purpose of this study is to gain a better understanding of levels of joint action leading toward collaboration between LHDs and hospitals and describe collaboration around CHAs.Methods: Local health departments were selected on the basis of reporting collaboration (n = 26) or unsure about collaboration (n = 29) with local hospitals. Local health departments were surveyed regarding their relationship with local hospitals. For LHDs currently collaborating with a hospital, a collaboration continuum scale was calculated. Appropriate nonparametric tests, chi-squares, and Spearman's rank correlations were conducted to determine differences between groups.Results: A total of 44 LHDs responded to the survey (80.0%). Currently collaborating LHDs were more likely to be interested in accreditation and to refer to their CHA 5 or more times a year compared to the unsure LHDs. In the analysis, a collaboration continuum was created and is positively correlated with aspects of the CHA and CHA process.Conclusions: This study is the first attempt to quantify the level of collaboration between LHDs and hospitals around CHAs. Better understanding of the levels of joint action required may assist LHDs in making informed decisions regarding deployment of resources on the path to accreditation.

The criteria include diseases or conditions that are unique, more prevalent, or more serious among women or have risk factors or interventions that are different for women. The 1990s ushered in a proliferation of policies and resources directed toward the understanding of sex and gender issues across the spectrum of health, health policy, and research. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Office of Research on Women's Health (ORWH), established in 1990, was the first public health service office dedicated to women's health. In addition to supporting research on women's health issues, the ORWH had a congressional mandate to develop opportunities and support for the advancement of women in biomedical careers and ensure the representation of women in biomedical and behavioral research studies. ORWH, through its Women's Health Agenda for the 21st Century, catapulted collaborative multidisciplinary research efforts across the NIH. A number of innovative career development and mentoring programs have been implemented to increase participation of women in interdisciplinary and clinical investigations. Other federal agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration, Health Resources and Services Administration Office of Women's Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Department of Health and Human Services Office on Women's Health, and Department of Defense, include gender and/or women-specific directives that are now codified into statute in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010. The NIH is altering its research focus to reduce reliance on male-only models that have been typical in many research areas for decades.

Multivariate logistic regression modeling was used to calculate predicted marginals to examine associations between never being screened and demographic characteristics and health belief model (HBM) constructs by metropolitan statistical area (MSA). After adjusting for all demographics and HBM constructs, prevalence of never being screened was higher for the following women: non-Hispanic Asians/Native Hawaiians/Pacific Islanders (16.5 %, 95 % CI = 13.7 %, 19.8 %) who live in MSAs; those with only a high school diploma who live in MSAs (5.5 %, 95 % CI = 4.7 %, 6.5 %); those living in non-MSAs who reported ""fair or poor"" general health (4.1 %, 95 % CI = 3.1 %, 5.4 %); and those living in either MSAs and non-MSAs unable to see a doctor within the past 12 months because of cost (MSA: 4.4 %, 95 % CI = 4.0 %, 4.8 %; non-MSA: 3.4 %, 95 % CI = 2.9 %, 3.9 %). The Affordable Care Act will expand access to insurance coverage for cervical cancer screening, without cost sharing for millions of women, essentially eliminating insurance costs as a barrier.

This study analyzes the decisions of new insurers and incumbent insurers already operating in a major market within a state to participate in state and federally facilitated exchanges. Study Design: Utilizing secondary data from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners∗ and government websites, we describe each state's insurance market in 2012, summarizing the number of incumbent insurers by size and operations in the individual market segment. Next, we investigate the organizational, market, and policy-related factors associated with incumbent insurers' participation decisions. Finally, we discuss the entry patterns of new insurers and briefly assess their potential impact on the market. Methods: We use multivariate regression analysis to identify the organizational, market, and policy-related factors related to insurer participation in exchanges. Results: Only 10% of incumbent insurers are participating in exchanges in 2014, although considerable variation exists across states. Participation is more prevalent among larger insurers, local and regional insurers, and those with prior experience in other market segments in the same state. The entry of newly formed organizations, such as cooperatives (co-ops), and of existing insurers into new states is modest. Conclusions: Robust participation of insurers is an important prerequisite to ensure competition in health insurance markets. Exchange administrators will need to better understand the strategic or operational reasons why insurers chose not to participate in the individual market exchanges in 2014."

Medicaid coverage of inpatient rehabilitation facility (IRF) admissions varies by state. We explored the role of state Medicaid IRF coverage on IRF utilization among patients with stroke. METHODS - : Working age ischemic stroke patients with Medicaid were identified from the 2010 Nationwide Inpatient Sample. Medicaid coverage of IRFs (yes versus no) was ascertained. Primary outcome was discharge to IRF (versus other discharge destinations). We fit a logistic regression model that included patient demographics, Medicaid coverage, comorbidities, length of stay, tissue-type plasminogen activator use, state Medicaid IRF coverage, and the interaction between patient Medicaid status and state Medicaid IRF coverage while accounting for hospital clustering. RESULTS - : Medicaid did not cover IRFs in 4 (TN, TX, SC, WV) of 42 states. The impact of State Medicaid IRF coverage was limited to Medicaid stroke patients (P for interaction <0.01). Compared with Medicaid stroke patients in states with Medicaid IRF coverage, Medicaid stroke patients hospitalized in states without Medicaid IRF coverage were less likely to be discharged to an IRF of 11.6% (95% confidence interval, 8.5%-14.7%) versus 19.5% (95% confidence interval, 18.3%-20.8%), P<0.01 after full adjustment. CONCLUSIONS - : State Medicaid coverage of IRFs is associated with IRF utilization among stroke patients with Medicaid.

Hierarchical models adjusting for relevant preoperative patient characteristics and comorbidities were used to estimate center-specific risk-adjusted costs and risk-adjusted postoperative length of stay. Variation in value across centers was assessed by the correlation between risk-adjusted measures of quality (mortality, morbidity/mortality) and resource use (costs and length of stay).Results There were no significant correlations between risk-adjusted costs and risk-adjusted mortality (r = 0.20, P =.45) or morbidity/mortality (r = 0.15, P =.57) across centers. Risk-adjusted costs and length of stay were not significantly associated (r = 0.23, P =.37) because of cost accounting differences across centers. This may explain the lack of correlation between risk-adjusted quality and risk-adjusted cost measures. When risk-adjusted length of stay and morbidity/mortality were used for the framework, there was a strong positive correlation (r = 0.67, P =.003), indicating that higher risk-adjusted quality is associated with shorter risk-adjusted length of stay.Conclusions Risk-adjusted length of stay and risk-adjusted combined morbidity/mortality are important outcome measures for assessing value in cardiac surgery. The proposed framework can be used to define value in CABG and identify high-value centers, thereby providing information for quality improvement and pay-for-performance initiatives.Objective Pay-for-performance measures, part of the Affordable Care Act, aim to reduce health care costs by linking value with Medicare payments, but until now the concept of value has not been applied to specific procedures.

The law attained near-universal insurance coverage and increased access to care. Its effect on population health is less clear. Objective: To determine whether the Massachusetts reform was associated with changes in all-cause mortality and mortality from causes amenable to health care. Design: Comparison of mortality rates before and after reform in Massachusetts versus a control group with similar demographics and economic conditions. Setting: Changes in mortality rates for adults in Massachusetts counties from 2001 to 2005 (prereform) and 2007 to 2010 (postreform) were compared with changes in a propensity score-defined control group of counties in other states. Participants: Adults aged 20 to 64 years in Massachusetts and control group counties. Measurements: Annual county-level all-cause mortality in age-, sex-, and race-specific cells (n = 146 825) from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Compressed Mortality File. Secondary outcomes were deaths from causes amenable to health care, insurance coverage, access to care, and self-reported health. Results: Reform in Massachusetts was associated with a significant decrease in all-cause mortality compared with the control group (-2.9%; P = 0.003, or an absolute decrease of 8.2 deaths per 100 000 adults). Deaths from causes amenable to health care also significantly decreased (-4.5%; P < 0.001). Changes were larger in counties with lower household incomes and higher prereform uninsured rates. Secondary analyses showed significant gains in coverage, access to care, and self-reported health. The number needed to treat was approximately 830 adults gaining health insurance to prevent 1 death per year. Limitations: Nonrandomized design subject to unmeasured confounders. Massachusetts results may not generalize to other states.

We evaluated risk factors for readmission and postdischarge adverse events after LEA in the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP). Methods: All patients undergoing transmetatarsal (TMA), below-knee (BKA), or above-knee amputation (AKA) in the 2011-2012 NSQIP were identified. Independent predischarge predictors of 30-day readmission were determined by multivariable logistic regression. Readmission indication and reinterventions, available in the 2012 NSQIP only, were also evaluated. Results: We identified 5732 patients undergoing amputation (TMA, 12%; BKA, 51%; AKA, 37%). Readmission rate was 18%. Postdischarge mortality rate was 5% (TMA, 2%; BKA, 3%; AKA, 8%; P < .001). Overall complication rate was 43% (in-hospital, 32%; postdischarge, 11%). Reoperation was for wound-related complication or additional amputation in 79% of cases. Independent predictors of readmission included chronic nursing home residence (odds ratio [OR], 1.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.0-1.7), nonelective surgery (OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.1-1.7), prior revascularization/amputation (OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.1-1.7), preoperative congestive heart failure (OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.2-2.4), and preoperative dialysis (OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.2-1.9). Guillotine amputation (OR, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.4-0.9) and non-home discharge (OR, 0.7; 95% CI, 0.6-1.0) were protective of readmission. Wound-related complications accounted for 49% of readmissions. Conclusions: Postdischarge morbidity, mortality, and readmission are common after LEA.

Methods: We conducted a mixed-methods analysis of WHMP breast cancer enrollees by race and urban/rural location. Quantitative analysis used a hazard rate model approach to identify differences in the timing of diagnosis, enrollment into Medicaid, and various modalities of treatment for 810 enrollees. Qualitative analysis used a systematic retrieval and review of coded data from 34 in-depth disease life history interview transcripts to a complete, focused analysis of enrollees' cancer treatment experiences. Findings: African-American women began treatment, on average, 6 days later after diagnosis than White women, driven by delays of one month among African-American women with late-stage cancers. This time delay for African-American women was not significant on multivariate analysis of time from enrollment to treatment. Once enrolled in WHMP, women reported gaining access to equitable breast cancer treatment regardless of race or location, with the exception of breast reconstruction, for which some women in our sample reported barriers to care. Conclusions: The equitable access to cancer treatment and other health services provided by WHMP to low-income, uninsured women in Georgia with breast cancer makes it a critical health care safety net program in Georgia, the need for which will continue through the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. © 2014 Jacobs Institute of Women's Health."

There are many patient-, dialysis facility-, ESRD Network- and health system-level barriers that contribute to this regional disparity. Compared to the rest of the nation, the Southeast has a larger population of African-Americans and higher poverty, as well as more prevalent ESRD risk factors including hypertension, obesity and diabetes. Dialysis facilities - where ESRD patients receive the majority of their healthcare - play an important role in transplant access. Identifying characteristics of individual dialysis units with low rates of kidney transplantation, such as understaffing or for-profit status, can help identify targets for quality improvement initiatives. Geographic differences across the country can identify opportunities to increase funding for healthcare resources in proportion to patient and disease burden. Focusing interventions among dialysis facilities with the lowest transplant rates within the Southeast, such as provider and patient education, has the potential to increase referrals for kidney transplantation, leading to higher rates of kidney transplants in this region. Referral for transplantation should be measured on a national level to monitor disparities in early access to transplantation. Transplant centers have an obligation to assist underserved populations in ensuring equity in access to services. Policies that improve access to care for patients, such as the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid expansion, are particularly important for Southern states and may alleviate geographic disparities.

Digoxin reduces 30-day all-cause hospital admission in chronic systolic heart failure. Whether digoxin is effective in reducing readmission after hospitalization for acute decompensation remains unknown. Methods: Of the 5153 Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized for acute heart failure and not receiving digoxin, 1054 (20%) received new discharge prescriptions for digoxin. Propensity scores for digoxin use, estimated for each of the 5153 patients, were used to assemble a matched cohort of 1842 (921 pairs) patients (mean age, 76 years; 56% women; 25% African American) receiving and not receiving digoxin, who were balanced on 55 baseline characteristics. Results: Thirty-day all-cause readmission occurred in 17% and 22% of matched patients receiving and not receiving digoxin, respectively (hazard ratio [HR] for digoxin, 0.77; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.63-0.95). This beneficial association was observed only in those with ejection fraction <45% (HR 0.63; 95% CI, 0.47-0.83), but not in those with ejection fraction ≥45% (HR 0.91; 95% CI, 0.60-1.37; P for interaction,.145), a difference that persisted throughout the first 12 months postdischarge (P for interaction,.019). HRs (95% CIs) for 12-month heart failure readmission and all-cause mortality were 0.72 (0.61-0.86) and 0.83 (0.70-0.98), respectively. Conclusions: In Medicare beneficiaries with systolic heart failure, a discharge prescription of digoxin was associated with lower 30-day all-cause hospital readmission, which was maintained at 12 months, and was not at the expense of higher mortality.

We sought to determine the impact of an insurance mandate on hospital use and outcomes among trauma intensive care unit (ICU) patients. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of trauma patients admitted to the ICU conducted at an academic, trauma center. Patients before (2004-2006) and after (2008-2012) the implementation of mandatory health insurance were compared using propensity matching to control for confounders. Outcomes were hospital length of stay (LOS), ICU LOS, in-hospital mortality, and discharge disposition. RESULTS: Overall, 1,668 trauma patients were included, with 530 matched on the propensity score in each group. Hospital LOS decreased by a median of 2.0 days, from 9.0 days (interquartile range, 4-15 days; p < 0.01) before to 7.0 days (interquartile range, 4-14) after implementation of the legislation. There were no differences in ICU LOS (3.0 days to 3.0 days, p = 0.44) and mortality (odds ratio [OR], 1.16; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.83-1.63). Compared with discharges to home, the patients were more likely to be discharged home with home health services after the legislation (OR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.08-2.68), but there was no significant change in the likelihoods of the patients being discharged to skilled nursing and rehabilitation facilities (OR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.72-1.31). CONCLUSION: Implementation of health care reform was associated with a decrease in hospital LOS, with an increase in use of home health services and no change in ICU LOS and mortality among trauma ICU patients at our institution.

In this environment, teaching hospitals will be closely scrutinized, as their care is often more expensive. Furthermore, although they serve vital roles in education, research, management of complex diseases, and care of vulnerable populations, debate continues as to whether teaching hospitals deliver better outcomes for common conditions. OBJECTIVE:: To determine the association between risk-standardized mortality and teaching intensity for 3 common conditions. RESEARCH DESIGN:: Using CMS models, 30-day risk-standardized mortality rates were compared among US hospitals classified as Council of Teaching Hospital (COTH) members, non-COTH teaching hospitals, or nonteaching hospitals. These analyses were repeated using ratios of interns and residents to beds to classify teaching intensity. SUBJECTS:: The study cohort included Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries aged 66 years or older hospitalized in acute care hospitals during 2009-2010 for acute myocardial infarction (N=342,145), heart failure (N=647,081), or pneumonia (N=598,366). OUTCOME MEASURE:: The 30-day risk-standardized mortality rates for each condition, stratified by teaching intensity. RESULTS:: For each diagnosis, compared with nonteaching hospitals there was a 10% relative reduction in the adjusted odds of mortality for patients admitted to COTH hospitals and a 6%-7% relative reduction for patients admitted to non-COTH teaching hospitals. These findings were insensitive to the method of classifying teaching intensity and only partially explained by higher teaching hospital volumes. CONCLUSIONS:: Health care reimbursement strategies designed to increase value should consider not only the costs but also the superior clinical outcomes at teaching hospitals for certain common conditions.

This legal and cultural consensus took root after a wave of individuals' complaints of government interference with their ability to practice their religion's dictates. But the current claims of religious interference have been increasingly asserted on behalf of an array of religiously affiliated institutions. Unlike previous claims, there is no normative consensus as to what, if any protections, these myriad institutions should receive. This uncertainty can be seen in the federal government's chaotic responses-from recent Supreme Court case law to the Affordable Care Act's contraception mandate. Scholars have staked out two opposing positions. One group has argued that churches and affiliated religious institutions should be entitled to legal autonomy. A second camp has argued that the state is the singular source of legal authority in modern politics and that all authority and status of a church is entirely derivative of its members' rights of voluntary association and conscience. This article proposes a third framework to determine the appropriate relationship between religious institutions and the state, what it dubs the Religious Institution Principle. Drawing on John Rawls, this framework rejects both the view that religious institutions are jurisdictionally independent of the modern state, and that religious institutions' status is derivative of its members' rights of association and conscience. Instead, the Article argues that religious institutions cannot be reduced to the individuals who compose them, but instead that the protections they deserve may be ""greater than the sum of the parts"" of their constituent members. The Religious Institution Principle provides a principled approach for determining what counts as a religious institution and what protections such institutions are entitled to."

One such barrier is not having sick leave to utilize preventive medical care. This study uses nationally representative U.S. data to examine whether having sick leave is associated with increased breast cancer screening among female employees. Methods: 17,198 observations of female employees aged 40 and over were examined using the 2006-10 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. We examined likelihood of having a clinical breast examination or mammography within 12 months with sick leave vs. no sick leave. Multivariate analyses adjust for age, education, race/ethnicity, poverty status, insurance, marital status, self-reported health and survey year. Afterward, we calculated predicted probabilities from the multivariate logistic regression to measure the impact of sick leave on breast cancer screening. Results: 71.8% of female employees with sick leave have clinical breast exam versus 60.1% of females with no sick leave. For mammograms, these percentages are 63.2% and 52.0%, respectively. After adjusting for socioeconomic status, access to care and health status, sick leave increases the odds of clinical breast exam (OR. = 1.22; p<. .001) and mammogram (OR. = 1.25; p<. .001). Conclusions: The United States has the fewest days of sick leave on average of any industrialized nation. However, more local governments are mandating employers to provide sick leave. Our results suggest that these policies are likely to significantly increase the odds of clinical breast examination and mammography among female workers. © 2014 The Authors."

To that end, we sought to determine those factors that contribute significantly to barrier days (BDs), when a patient is medically cleared for discharge but unable to leave the hospital. We hypothesized that there would be significant demographic and payor factors associated with BDs. METHODS: All trauma admissions to a Level II trauma center discharged alive from 2010 to 2012 were queried from the trauma registry. BDs were identified and recorded at daily sign-out. Patients with a hospital length of stay of 24 hours or less or transferred to another hospitalwere excluded. Univariate logistic regression was used to analyze which factors were significant (p e 0.05) for BDs. Significant variables were then included in a multivariate logistic regression model. RESULTS: A total of 3,056 patients were included in the study, 105 (3.44%) of whom had at least one BD. Multivariate analysis revealed that patients awaiting nursing home placement and rehabilitation placement were at 6.39 and 2.79 times higher odds of having significant barriers to discharge, respectively, compared with patients whowere discharged home. The multivariate model also showed that Medicaid coverage, one or more comorbidities, Injury Severity Score of 9 or greater, and one or more ventilation days had a significant correlation with the incidence of BDs. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that discharge destination is a significant factor associated with BDs. Understanding what type of patient is prone to develop barriers to discharge will allow case managers and social workers to intervene with discharge planning early in that patient's hospital course to secure placement and possibly reduce health care costs and improve functional outcome.Copyright © 2013 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins."

Methods: Outreach locations and clinic frequencies are tracked annually in the Visiting Medical Consultant Database (Carver College of Medicine) along with the physicians' primary practice locations. Growth in the number of cities served and number of clinic days from 1989 to 2011 was analyzed using joinpoint analysis. Data from 2011 were used to estimate the trip length for participating oncologists. Results: The number of rural cities served by medical oncology outreach increased significantly between 1989 and 1996. Clinic days grew significantly in two periods: 1989 to 1998 and 2003 to 2005. In 2011, more than 2,100 clinic days were provided in 66 sites (95% of clinic days in rural areas). Almost half of all Iowa-based oncologists regularly participate in outreach. Oncologists staffing visiting consultant clinics in Iowa drive an estimated 21,000 miles per month. Conclusions: For more than 20 years, visiting medical oncologists have brought cancer care to rural patients in Iowa. Access to cancer care in rural Iowa (ie, clinic days) increased significantly in the post-Medicare Modernization Act period (after 2005). High participation rates and travel burdens may influence oncologist training and retention strategies. Because the Affordable Care Act seeks to expand access for vulnerable populations (eg, rural elderly), it is critical to better understand the existing system of rural cancer care delivery.

The Obama Administration, for example, has announced policies of abstaining from investigation and prosecution of certain federal marijuana crimes, postponing enforcement of key provisions of the Affordable Care Act, and suspending enforcement of removal statutes against certain undocumented immigrants. While these examples highlight how exercises of executive enforcement discretion-the authority to turn a blind eye to legal violations-may effectively reshape federal policy, prior scholarship has offered no satisfactory account of the proper scope of, and constitutional basis for, this putative executive authority. This Article fills that gap. Through close examination of the Constitution's text, structure, and normative underpinnings, as well as relevant historical practice, this Article demonstrates that constitutional authority for enforcement discretion exists-but it is both limited and defeasible. Presidents may properly decline to enforce civil and criminal prohibitions in particular cases, notwithstanding their obligation under the Take Care Clause to ensure that ""the Laws be faithfully executed."" Congress also may expand the scope of executive enforcement discretion by authorizing broader nonenforcement. But absent such congressional authorization, the President's nonenforcement authority extends neither to prospective licensing of prohibited conduct nor to policy-based nonenforcement of federal laws for entire categories of offenders. Presuming such forms of executive discretion would collide with another deeply rooted constitutional tradition: the principle that American Presidents, unlike English kings, lack authority to suspend statutes or grant dispensations that prospectively excuse legal violations. This framework not only clarifies the proper executive duty with respect to enforcement of federal statutes but also points the way to proper resolution of other recurrent separation of powers issues."

This multi-institutional administrative database analysis compares outcomes of thoracotomy and sternotomy approaches for mitral repair.© 2014 The American Association for Thoracic Surgery Methods The Premier database was queried from 2007 to 2011 for mitral repair hospitalizations. Premier contains billing, cost, and coding data from more than 600 US hospitals, totaling 25 million discharges. Thoracotomy and sternotomy approaches were identified through expert rules; robotics were excluded. Propensity matching on baseline characteristics was performed. Regression analysis of surgical approach on outcomes and costs was modeled.Results Expert rule analysis positively identified thoracotomy in 847 and sternotomy in 566. Propensity matching created 2 groups of 367. Mortalities were similar (thoracotomy 1.1% vs sternotomy 1.9%). Sepsis and other infections were significantly lower with thoracotomy (1.1% vs 4.4%). After adjustment for hospital differences, thoracotomy carried a 17.2% lower hospitalization cost (-$8289) with a 2-day stay reduction. Readmission rates were significantly lower with thoracotomy (26.2% vs 35.7% at 30 days and 31.6% vs 44.1% at 90 days). Thoracotomy was more common in southern and northeastern hospitals (63% vs 37% and 64% vs 36%, respectively), teaching hospitals (64% vs 36%) and larger hospitals (>600 beds, 78% vs 22%).Conclusions Relative to sternotomy, thoracotomy for mitral repairs provides similar mortality, less morbidity, fewer infections, shorter stay, and significant cost savings during primary admission. The markedly lower readmission rates for thoracotomy will translate into additional institutional cost savings when a penalty on hospitals begins under the Affordable Care Act's Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program."

This study sought to elucidate the relationship between EDU frequency and access to a comprehensive medical home for children with DD. Methods: This study conducted multivariate logistic regression analysis on data from the 2005-2006 National Survey of Children with Special Health Care Needs to explore the association between EDU frequency among children with DD and medical home. Results: Compared with children with DD reporting zero EDU, children with 3 or more EDU were less likely to report access to usual health care source (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 0.63; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.45-0.88). Moreover, children with DD who had 3 or more EDU were less likely to have clinicians who listen to parental concerns (AOR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.45-0.76), demonstrate sensitivity toward family values and customs (AOR = 0.60, 95% CI = 0.46, 0.78), and build meaningful family partnerships (AOR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.53-0.89). Conclusions: The study suggests that children with DD reporting 3 or more EDU per year would likely reduce their EDU by having access to usual source of primary care services and to clinicians with skills in building meaningful partnership with the parents. The inclusion of these medical home attributes in the adoption of patient-centered medical homes with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act presents a mechanism to improve care at lower cost as well as facilitate chronic disease management and coordination between emergency medicine and primary care physicians that may lead to reductions in EDU and unnecessary hospitalization.

Because there are an overwhelming number of hospital readmissions for individuals with heart failure, efforts are underway to discover how they can be supported and educated during their hospitalization and subsequently followed by a nurse after discharge for continued education and support. PURPOSE:: The purpose of this integrative review was to critically examine the interventions, quality of life, and readmission rates of individuals with heart failure who are enrolled in a transitional care program. The second aim was to examine the cost-effectiveness of nurse-led transitional care programs. CONCLUSIONS:: The results of this integrative review (n = 20) showed that transitional care programs for individuals with heart failure can increase a patient's quality of life and decrease the number of readmissions and the overall cost of care. The types of interventions that were most successful in decreasing readmissions used home visits alone or in combination with telephone calls. There is a need for nurse researchers to address gaps in transitional care for heart failure patients by performing studies with larger randomized clinical trials and measuring outcomes such as readmissions at regular intervals over the study period. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:: The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act will change reimbursement for heart failure readmissions and presents opportunities for healthcare teams to build transitional care programs for patients with conditions such as heart failure. This integrative review can be used to determine effective intervention strategies for transitional care programs and highlights the gaps in research. Healthcare teams that use these programs within their practice may increase continuity of care and quality of life and decrease readmissions and healthcare costs for individuals with heart failure. © 2014 Wolters Kluwer Health Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

Purpose To explore racial and ethnic differences in breast and cervical cancer screening rates before and during the Great Recession. Methods The Medical Expenditure Panel was the source for identifying 10,894 women, ages 50-74 for breast screening and 19,957 women, ages 21-65 for cervical screening. Survey years included 2004-2005 and 2009-2010. Dependent variables were as follows: 1) receipt of mammogram within the past 2 years; and 2) receipt of a Pap smear within the past 3 years. The interaction of the recession and the likelihood of screening between whites and minorities was analyzed. Multivariate regressions were applied to estimate the likelihood of screening for the two time periods while controlling for a recession variable. Results Nationally, breast and cervical cancer screening rates dropped during the recession period; white women contributed most to the decline. However, there were significant improvements in timely screening for both cancers among Hispanics during the recession period. After controlling for the recession, African American women were more likely to have timely screenings compared to white women. Screening rates during the recession were lowest in the South, Midwest and West.

BACKGROUND: The increased health care costs and morbidity linked to appendiceal rupture are considered preventable in most cases with timely access to surgery. Among the factors thought to affect an individual's access to surgery for appendicitis is the relative supply of GSs. The maldistribution of GSs is targeted by a Medicare bonus payment although the impact of GS supply on surgical access has yet to be fully described. METHODS: Patients discharged from acute care and ambulatory surgery facilities in North Carolina from 2007 to 2009 were pooled for observational analysis. Using ICD-9-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification) codes, cases were identified as ruptured or unruptured. GS shortage levels based on supply were calculated at the surgical service area level and tested for an association with an individual's risk of rupture using logistic regression. RESULTS: Living in a service area with less than 3 GSs per 100,000 people significantly increases the probability of rupture in individuals with appendicitis, compared with living in a service area with at least 5 GSs per 100,000. CONCLUSIONS: The supply of GSs does affect access to surgical services for appendicitis. Expanding on this finding, the recently instituted HPSA (health professional shortage area) surgical incentive payment from the Affordable Care Act should be evaluated closely for its effectiveness. Enhancing supply in critical shortage areas could reduce appendiceal rupture and improve surgical access more generally. Copyright © 2014 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins."

Combined with population growth and aging adults, expanded insurance coverage will dramatically increase the demand for primary care services. To encourage medical students to pursue primary care, medical schools are integrating courses that will expose students to primary care medicine early in their education.METHODS: We used a descriptive, cross-sectional study design to evaluate the impact of a week-long intensive course in primary care on first-year medical students’ attitudes toward primary care. We developed a 25-item survey to assess medical students’ knowledge, perception, and attitudes about primary care; the survey was administered before and after the course.RESULTS: A total of 125 first-year medical students (mean age=23.7 ± 2.9 years, 52.4% female, 75.8% Non-Hispanic white, 11.2% rural) completed the pre-course survey, and 117 completed the post-course survey. We observed positive improvements in attitudes toward primary care in 20 of the 25 survey questions (with effect sizes ranging from 0.16–0.33). Further, students stated that the course improved their understanding of the scope of primary care and emphasized the importance and complexity of primary care medicine.CONCLUSIONS: A week-long intensive course in primary care can influence medical students' attitudes toward primary care; however, the long-term impact on students' decision to pursue primary care is not known and needs to be evaluated.

Little is known about this population's health or access to care. Methods Sixty-one DACA-eligible Latinos aged 18-31 years were recruited from community and Internet settings to participate in nine focus groups in California. An advisory board of immigration and health advocates assisted in the project's design and validation of results. Results Participants reported avoiding the health care system whenever possible, first turning to family members and unlicensed community healers, then seeking safety net providers if necessary. Barriers to care included cost, limited intergenerational knowledge about the health care system, lack of a driver's license, and mistrust of providers due to fear of discrimination and deportation. Mental health care was the greatest unmet health need. They wanted more information about their health care options and access to primary care, dental, and vision benefits. Participants reported refraining from high-risk behaviors to avoid associated financial and legal burdens that might threaten their immigration status. Conclusions As the first study to describe DACA-eligible young adults' health needs, these data demonstrate their profound mental health challenges and numerous barriers to health care access.

An analysis of trends in U.S. pharmaceutical spending is presented, including projections for drug expenditures in nonfederal hospital and clinic settings in 2014. Methods. Trends in pharmaceutical expenditures and developments likely to influence future spending, including new drug approvals and patent expirations, were analyzed using data from the IMS Health National Sales Perspectives database. Projections were based on a combination of quantitative and qualitative analyses and expert opinion. Results. Total prescription sales for the 12 months ending September 2013 were approximately $326 billion, 0.7% lower than sales during the previous 12 months; pharmaceutical spending by clinics and nonfederal hospitals grew by 4.5% and 1.8%, respectively. Vaccines were among the products driving large sales increases in clinic settings, with alteplase and pegfilgrastim topping the list of fast-growing drugs by hospital expenditures. Few new drug approvals anticipated in 2014 are expected to result in major expenditures by hospitals and clinics. Expansion of access to health care and other changes related to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as well as continued improvement in the U.S. economy, may drive growth in pharmaceutical spending over the next 12-24 months. Conclusion. Growth in U.S. prescription drug expenditures is expected to rebound in 2014, with a projected 3-5% increase in total drug expenditures across all settings this year, including a 5-7% increase in clinic spending and a 1-3% increase in hospital spending.

Both laws expand eligibility for low-income individuals to qualify for Medicaid, require individuals to have insurance if they have access to affordable coverage, include an employer penalty, and provide government subsidies to low-income people who are not eligible for Medicaid. In addition both envision an insurance exchange to create a market in which individuals and small businesses purchase affordable insurance. Contrary to the myths about the Massachusetts reform, it has not led to the rationing of care, to individuals and employers dropping private insurance, and has not bankrupted the state. The Massachusetts law has expanded healthcare coverage so that about only 2 % of Massachusetts residents are uninsured. The overwhelming percent of employers subject to the employer mandate have complied with the law; fewer than 5 % have been subjected to penalties. More people have a regular provider and fewer people delay getting health care due to costs compared to prior to the law. The law appears to have had a positive impact on the health of people in Massachusetts as, for example, more women are receiving early prenatal care, more people are getting preventive care like cancer screenings, and more people with diabetes are getting appropriate care related to diabetes. The high cost of health care in Massachusetts has been a long-standing problem and was not exacerbated by the law.

Specifically, the diffusion of innovation theory implies that 'early adopters' are more inclined to use CDS tools and younger physicians tend to be ranked in this category.OBJECTIVE: This study examined the differences in adoption of CDS tools across providers' training level.PARTICIPANTS: From November 2010 to 2011, 168 residents and attendings from an academic medical institution were enrolled into a randomized controlled trial.INTERVENTION: The intervention arm had access to the CDS tool through the electronic health record (EHR) system during strep and pneumonia patient visits.MAIN MEASURES: The EHR system recorded details on how intervention arm interacted with the CDS tool including acceptance of the initial CDS alert, completion of risk-score calculators and the signing of medication order sets. Using the EHR data, the study performed bivariate tests and general estimating equation (GEE) modeling to examine the differences in adoption of the CDS tool across residents and attendings.KEY RESULTS: The completion rates of the CDS calculator and medication order sets were higher amongst first year residents compared to all other training levels. Attendings were the less likely to accept the initial step of the CDS tool (29.3%) or complete the medication order sets (22.4%) that guided their prescription decisions, resulting in attendings ordering more antibiotics (37.1%) during an CDS encounter compared to residents.CONCLUSION: There is variation in adoption of CDS tools across training levels. Attendings tended to accept the tool less but ordered more medications. CDS tools should be tailored to clinicians' training levels."

With the passage into law of the Affordable Care Act, additional guidelines were generated in 2010 to ensure nonprofit hospitals are compliant. Nonetheless, the debate continues on whether nonprofit hospitals provide adequate charity care to their patient population. In this study, charity care provided by 29 Washington State nonprofit urban hospitals was examined for 2011 using financial data from the Washington State Department of Health. Charity care levels were compared to both income tax savings and gross revenues to generate two financial ratios that were analyzed according to hospital bed size and nonprofit ownership type. For the first ratio, 97% of the hospitals (28 of 29) were providing charity care in greater amounts than the tax savings they accrued. The average ratio value using total charity care and total income tax savings of all the hospitals in the study was 6.10, and the median value was 3.46. The nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test results by bed size and nonprofit ownership type indicate that ownership type has a significant effect on charity care to gross revenue ratios (p = .020). Our analysis indicates that church-owned hospitals had higher ratios of charity care to gross revenues than did the other two ownership types--government and voluntary--in this sample. Policy implications are offered and further studies are recommended to analyze appropriate levels of charity care in nonprofit hospitals given new requirements for maintaining a hospital's tax-exempt status."

Maturity as a psychotherapist is essential because a psychiatrist is the only mental health provider who, as a physician, can assume full responsibility for biopsychosocial patient care and roles as supervisor, consultant, and team leader. Graduating residents face an environment in which surveys show a steady and alarming decline in practice of psychotherapy by psychiatrists, along with a decline in job satisfaction. High educational debts, practice structures, intrusive management, and reimbursement policies that devalue psychotherapy discourage early career psychiatrists from a practice style that enables providing it. For the early-career psychiatrist there is thus the serious risk of being unable to develop a critical mass of experience or a secure identity as a psychiatric psychotherapist. Implementation of parity laws and the Affordable Care Act (ACA) will affect the situation in unpredictable ways that call for vigilance and active response. Additional service and administrative demands may result from the ACA, creating ethical dilemmas about meeting urgent patient needs versus biopsychosocial standards of care. The authors recommend 1) vigorous advocacy for better payment levels for psychotherapy and freedom from disruptive management; 2) aggressive action against violations of the parity act, 3) active preparation of psychiatric residents for dealing with career choices and the environment for providing psychotherapy in their practice, and 4) post-graduate training in psychotherapy through supervision/consultation, continuing education courses, computer instruction, and distance learning. © 2014 The American Academy of Psychoanalysis and Dynamic Psychiatry."

This observational study examined receipt of A1C tests, annual eye and foot exams, flu vaccination, diabetes self-management education (DSME), exercise, self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG), and self feet examinations among US adults with diabetes using national survey data from 2001 to 2010. Analyses included estimating proportions for each indicator by year, testing differences in magnitude of change from 2001 to 2010 by race/ethnicity, and regression models to assess changes in care over time and factors associated with care. There were significant increases from 2001 to 2010 in A1C tests, annual foot exams, flu shots, DSME, and SMBG but declines in eye and self feet exams. DSME was positively associated with receipt of several care indicators. However, only half of respondents received DSME. White and black non-Hispanics, respectively, experienced improvements in at least 3 indicators. Hispanics experienced a significant increase in exercise but were consistently less likely than whites to receive or engage in most care. While improvements in several indicators were observed, patterns varied by race/ethnicity, with Hispanics falling short on most measures. DSME was strongly associated with most care and demonstrates the potential to improve receipt of recommended care by increasing DSME participation. With the Affordable Care Act (ACA), health professionals have a prime opportunity to leverage ACA provisions to increase access to recommended services, including DSME. © 2014, SAGE Publications.

The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation funded 7 grantees across the country to design and implement value-based, multistakeholder payment reform projects in 6 states and 3 regions of the United States. Methods: As the external evaluator of these projects, we reviewed documents, conducted Internet searches, interviewed key stakeholders, cross-validated factual and narrative interpretation, and performed qualitative analyses to derive cross-site themes and implications for policy and practice. Findings: The nature of payment reform and its momentum closely reflects the environmental context of each project. Federal legislation such as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and federal and state support for the development of the patient-centered medical home and accountable care organizations encourage value-based payment innovation, as do local market conditions for payers and providers that combine a history of collaboration with independent innovation and experimentation by individual organizations. Multistakeholder coalitions offer a useful facilitating structure for galvanizing payment reform. But to achieve the objectives of reduced cost and improved quality, multistakeholder payment innovation must overcome such barriers as incompatible information systems, the technical difficulties and transaction costs of altering existing billing and payment systems, competing stakeholder priorities, insufficient scale to bear population health risk, providers' limited experience with risk-bearing payment models, and the failure to align care delivery models with the form of payment. Conclusions: From the evidence adduced in this article, multistakeholder, value-based payment reform requires a trusted, widely respected ""honest broker"" that can convene and maintain the ongoing commitment of health plans, providers, and purchasers. Change management is complex and challenging, and coalition governance requires flexibility and stable leadership, as market conditions and stakeholder engagement and priorities shift over time. Another significant facilitator of value-based payment reform is outside investment that enables increased investment in human resources, information infrastructure, and care management by provider organizations and their collaborators. Supportive community and social service networks that enhance population health management also are important enablers of value-based payment reform. External pressure from public and private payers is fueling a ""burning bridge"" between the past of fee-for-service payment models and the future of payments based on value. Robust competition in local health plan and provider markets, coupled with an appropriate mix ofmultistakeholder governance, pressure from organized purchasers, and regulatory oversight, has the potential to spur valuebased payment innovation that combines elements of ""reformed"" fee-for-service with bundled payments and global payments. © 2014 Milbank Memorial Fund.

In a 2002 study of 50 000 home care patients, catheter dysfunction with loss of patency was the most common complication and occurred in 29% of the peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) tracked. With the advent of the Affordable Care Act and the promise of expanded home care services, this study offers evidence as to a preferred flushing protocol to prevent catheter patency complications for home infusion patients with PICCs. Methods: This prospective, randomized, 1-way, single-blinded posttest with control group study was performed to compare 3 commonly used flushing protocols in home infusion patients with PICCs. The independent variable was the flushing protocol, and dependent variables included the development of patency-related complications and other significant issues such as sluggishness, occlusion, missed medication doses, catheter replacement, additional nursing visits, and the use of alteplase (Cathflo Activase). DATA Analysis/Results: Each of the study groups had patients who experienced 1 or more patency-related complications. Additional factors that may affect catheter function, including patient age, gender, diagnosis, therapy type, frequency of catheter use, catheter brand/size/number of lumens, concomitant use of anticoagulant medications, and whether PICCs were used for routine lab testing, were analyzed, and no statistical significance was determined. Catheter dwell time (catheter days) was statistically significant (p = .003, confidence interval = 95%; assuming equal variance) and confirmed the assumption that the longer a home care patient's catheter was in place, the more complications occurred. There were no cases of heparin allergy, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, or line infection. Discussion/Conclusion/Recommendations For Practice:: The data provide some evidence to support the elimination of heparin flushing in home care patients with PICCs, although data in the saline-only group that related to additional registered nurse visits to assess PICC patency and the use of alteplase (Cathflo Activase) were trending toward significance because this group experienced a higher incidence of these complications than both the heparin groups. These findings should not be translated to home care patients with cancer or pregnancy diagnoses because these populations were excluded from this study.

Excess readmissions for certain medical conditions and procedures now result in penalizations on all Medicare reimbursements. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this work was to define the risk factors, outcomes, and costs of 30-day readmissions after colorectal surgery. DESIGN: Adults undergoing colorectal surgery were studied using data from the University HealthSystem Consortium. Univariate and multivariable analyses were used to identify patient-related risk factors for, and 30- day outcomes of, readmission after colorectal surgery. SETTINGS: This study was conducted at an academic hospital and its affiliates. PATIENTS: Adults ≥18 years of age who underwent colorectal surgery for cancer, diverticular disease, IBD, or benign tumors between 2008 and 2011 were included in this study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Readmission within 30 days of index discharge was the main outcome measured. RESULTS: A total of 70,484 patients survived the index hospitalization after colorectal surgery; 9632 (13.7%) were readmitted within 30 days of discharge. The strongest independent predictors of readmission were length of stay ≥4 days (OR 1.44; 95% CI 1.32-1.57), stoma (OR 1.54; 95% CI 1.46-1.51), and discharge to skilled nursing (OR 1.62; 95% CI 1.49-1.76) or rehabilitation facility (OR 2.93; 95% CI 2.53-3.40). Of those readmitted, half of the readmissions occurred within 7 days, 13% required the intensive care unit, 6% had a reoperation, and 2% died during the readmission stay. The median combined total direct hospital cost was more than 2 times higher ($26,917 vs $13,817; p < 0.001) for readmitted than for nonreadmitted patients. LIMITATIONS: Follow-up was limited to 30 days after initial discharge. CONCLUSIONS: Readmissions after colorectal resection occur frequently and incur a significant financial burden on the health-care system. Future studies aimed at targeted interventions for high-risk patients may reduce readmissions and curb escalating health-care costs. © The ASCRS 2014."

Primary Practice Setting(s): T he setting for this study was primary care medical home practices with a minimum of 1,000 lives, contracted with a health plan delivering Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance coverage. Methodology and Sample: F ive medical home practice sites were selected for the intervention. The study began with case manager training and project permission in 5 medical homes, followed by implementation of care coordination with health plan clients. The nurse case manager performed care coordination functions for clients and initiated a Lean Six Sigma quality improvement project at the medical home site. The analysis strategy was to compare each medical home with itself before and after the intervention, as well as to obtain satisfaction information from medical home staff and care coordinators. Results: R eductions in expense, as demonstrated by decreased per member per month claim cost, admissions per thousand, and reduced variation in days per thousand, were documented. Quality projects attained signifi cant improvements in 4 out of 5 sites, and practice staff as well as case managers described satisfaction with the embedded nurse case manager role. These fi ndings support medical homes as being an effective delivery model of the Affordable Care Act. Implications for Case Management Practice: C ase managers who practice in primary care sites can make a signifi cant difference in patient outcomes and practice effi ciencies. Embedded case managers have the ability to impact the population being served through modeling and supporting interprofessional relationships and case management expertise. Use of motivational interviewing, assessment skills, advocacy, and joint care planning engage patients in their own care, whereas quality initiatives bring effi ciencies and effectiveness to overall operations. There is need for research to be conducted across a larger number of practice sites and diverse populations to substantiate the effect of embedded case management in medical home.

Unlike physical and mental health problems, treatment for SUDs is predominantly provided in a separate specialty sector and more heavily financed by public sources. Medicaid expansion under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act has the potential to increase access to treatment for SUDs but only if an infrastructure exists to serve new enrollees. OBJECTIVE To examine the availability of outpatient SUD treatment facilities that accept Medicaid across US counties and whether counties with a higher percentage of racial/ethnic minorities are more likely to have gaps in this infrastructure. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We used data from the 2009 National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services public use file and the 2011-2012 Area Resource file to examine sociodemographic factors associated with county-level access to SUD treatment facilities that serve Medicaid enrollees. Counties in all 50 states were included.We estimated a probit model with state indicators to adjust for state-level heterogeneity in demographics, politics, and policies. Independent variables assessed county racial/ethnic composition (ie, percentage black and percentage Hispanic), percentage living in poverty, percentage living in a rural area, percentage insured with Medicaid, percentage uninsured, and total population. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Dichotomous indicator for counties with at least 1 outpatient SUD treatment facility that accepts Medicaid. RESULTS Approximately 60% of US counties have at least 1 outpatient SUD facility that accepts Medicaid, although this rate is lower in many Southern and Midwestern states than in other areas of the country. Counties with a higher percentage of black (marginal effect [ME], -3.1; 95%CI, -5.2%to -0.9%), rural (-9.2%; -11.1%to -7.4%), and/or uninsured (-9.5%; -13.0% to -5.9%) residents are less likely to have one of these facilities. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The potential for increasing access to SUD treatment via Medicaid expansion may be tempered by the local availability of facilities to provide care, particularly for counties with a high percentage of black and/or uninsured residents and for rural counties. Although states that opt in to the expansion will secure additional federal funds for the SUD treatment system, additional policiesmay need to be implemented to ensure that adequate geographic access exists across local communities to serve new enrollees.

Practices in rural counties were more likely to offer patients with Medicaid an appointment as compared with practices in urban counties (odds ratio, 2.25 [95% confidence interval, 1.16 to 4.34]; p = 0.016). Practices more than sixty miles from academic hospitals were more likely to accept patients with Medicaid than practices closer to academic hospitals (odds ratio, 3.35 [95% confidence interval, 1.44 to 7.83]; p = 0.005).Methods: Two hundred and three orthopaedic practices within the state of North Carolina were randomly selected and were contacted on two different occasions separated by three weeks. An appointment was requested for a fictitious adult orthopaedic patient with a potential surgical problem. Injury scenarios included patients with acute rotator cuff tears, zone- II flexor tendon lacerations, and acute lumbar disc herniations. Insurance status was reported as Medicaid at the time of the first request and private insurance at the time of the second request. County population density and the distance from each practice to the nearest academic hospital were recorded.Conclusions: Access to orthopaedic care was significantly decreased for patients with Medicaid. Practices in less populous areas were more likely to offer an appointment to patients with Medicaid than practices in more populous areas. Practices that were farther from academic hospitals were more likely to offer an appointment to patients with Medicaid than practices closer to academic hospitals.Clinical Relevance: This study illustrates the barriers to timely outpatient orthopaedic care that patients withMedicaid face. The findings fromour study imply that patients with Medicaid in more populous areas and in areas closer to academic medical centers are less likely to obtain an outpatient orthopaedic appointment than patients withMedicaid in less populous areas and in areasmore distant from academic medical centers. A shift in policy to enhance access to orthopaedic care for patients with Medicaid, especially those in urban areas and areas close to academicmedical centers, will become increasingly important as more patients become eligible for Medicaid through the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010.Background: Access to care is limited for patients with Medicaid with many conditions, but data investigating this relationship in the orthopaedic literature are limited. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between health insurance status and access to care for a diverse group of adult orthopaedic patients, specifically if access to orthopaedic care is influenced by population density or distance from academic teaching hospitals. © 2014 by The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery, Incorporated."

Limited information on the effects of cost sharing among children is available to guide these efforts. OBJECTIVE: To examine the associations between cost sharing, income, and care seeking and financial stress among children with asthma. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A telephone survey in 2012 about experiences during the prior year within an integrated health care delivery system. Respondents included 769 parents of children aged 4 to 11 years with asthma. Of these, 25.9% of children received public subsidies; 21.7% were commercially insured with household incomes at or below 250% of the federal poverty level (FPL) and 18.2%had higher cost-sharing levels for all services (eg, ≥$75 for emergency department visits). We classified children with asthma based on (1) current receipt of a subsidy (ie, Medicaid or Children's Health Insurance Program) or potential eligibility for ACA low-income cost sharing or premium subsidies in 2014 (ie, income ≤250%, 251%-400%, or >400% of the FPL) and (2) cost-sharing levels for prescription drugs, office visits, and emergency department visits. We examined the frequency of changes in care seeking and financial stress due to asthma care costs across these groups using logistic regression, adjusted for patient/family characteristics. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Switching to cheaper asthma drugs, using less medication than prescribed, delaying/avoiding any office or emergency department visits, and financial stress (eg, cutting back on necessities) because of the costs of asthma care. RESULTS: After adjustment, parents at or below 250% of the FPL with lower vs higher cost-sharing levels were less likely to delay or avoid taking their children to a physician's office visit (3.8% vs 31.6%; odds ratio, 0.07 [95% CI, 0.01-0.39]) and the emergency department (1.2% vs 19.4%; 0.05 [0.01-0.25]) because of cost; higher-income parents and those whose children were receiving public subsidies (eg, Medicaid) were also less likely to forego their children's care than parents at or below 250% of the FPL with higher cost-sharing levels. Overall, 15.6%of parents borrowed money or cut back on necessities to pay for their children's asthma care. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Cost-related barriers to care among children with asthma were concentrated among low-income families with higher cost-sharing levels. The ACA's low-income subsidies could reduce these barriers for many families, but millions of dependents for whom employer-sponsored family coverage is unaffordable could remain at risk for cost-related problems because of ACA subsidy eligibility rules."

The explanation for these differences is largely unknown and may result from confounding variables. The Affordable Care Act expansion of Medicaid coverage in 2014 makes the examination of these disparities particularly relevant.Methods: The Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database was used to identify patients who had undergone primary hip or knee arthroplasty from 2002 through 2011. Complications, costs, and length of hospital stay for patients with Medicaid were compared with those for non-Medicaid patients. Each Medicaid patient was matched to a non-Medicaid patient according to age, sex, race, type of total joint arthroplasty, procedure year, hospital characteristics, smoking status, and all twenty-nine comorbidities defined in the NIS-modified Elixhauser co-morbidity measure.Results: It was determined that 191,911 patients who underwent total joint arthroplasty had Medicaid payer status (2.8% of the entire total joint arthroplasty population), and 107,335 (56%) of these Medicaid patients were matched one to one to a non-Medicaid patient for all variables for the adjusted analysis. After matching, Medicaid patients were found to have a higher prevalence of postoperative in-hospital infection (odds ratio [OR], 1.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3 to 2.1), wound dehiscence (OR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.4 to 3.4), and hematoma or seroma (OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.2 to 1.4) but a lower risk of cardiac complications (OR, 0.7; CI, 0.6 to 0.9). The length of the hospital stay was longer, total cost was higher, and discharge to an inpatient facility was more frequent for patients with Medicaid status (p < 0.01).Conclusions: Compared with non-Medicaid patients, Medicaid patients have a significantly higher risk for certain postoperative in-hospital complications and consume more resources following total joint arthroplasty even when the two groups have been matched for patient-related factors and comorbid conditions commonly associated with low socio-economic status. Additional work is needed to understand the complex interplay between socioeconomic status and outcomes, to ensure appropriate resources are allocated to maintain access for this patient population, and to develop appropriate risk stratification.Level of Evidence: Prognostic Level III.

Since 2004, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) has recommended alcohol misuse screening and behavioral counseling (also known as alcohol screening and brief intervention [ASBI]) for adults to address excessive alcohol use; however, little is known about the prevalence of its implementation. ASBI will also be covered by many health insurance plans because of the Affordable Care Act. Methods: CDC analyzed Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data from a question added to surveys in 44 states and the District of Columbia (DC) from August 1 to December 31, 2011, about patient-reported communication with a health professional about alcohol. Elements of ASBI are traditionally delivered via conversation. Weighted state-level prevalence estimates of this communication were generated for 166,753 U.S. adults aged ≥18 years by selected demographic characteristics and drinking behaviors. Results: The prevalence of ever discussing alcohol use with a health professional was 15.7% among U.S. adults overall, 17.4% among current drinkers, and 25.4% among binge drinkers. It was most prevalent among those aged 18-24 years (27.9%). However, only 13.4% of binge drinkers reported discussing alcohol use with a health professional in the past year, and only 34.9% of those who reported binge drinking ≥10 times in the past month had ever discussed alcohol with a health professional. State-level estimates of communication about alcohol ranged from 8.7% in Kansas to 25.5% in DC. Conclusions: Only one of six U.S. adults, including binge drinkers, reported ever discussing alcohol consumption with a health professional, despite public health efforts to increase ASBI implementation. Implications for Public Health Practice: Increased implementation of ASBI, including systems-level changes such as integration into electronic health records processes, might reduce excessive alcohol consumption and the harms related to it. Routine surveillance of ASBI by states and communities might support monitoring and increasing its implementation."

OBJECTIVE To assess primary care appointment availability by state and insurance status. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We conducted a simulated patient study. Trained field staff, randomly assigned to private insurance, Medicaid, or uninsured, called primary care offices requesting the first available appointment for either routine care or an urgent health concern. The study included a stratified random sample of primary care practices treating nonelderly adults within each of 10 states (Arkansas, Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Massachusetts, Montana, New Jersey, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Texas), selected for diversity along numerous dimensions. Collectively, these states comprise almost one-third of the US nonelderly, Medicaid, and currently uninsured populations. Sampling was based on enrollment by insurance type by county. Analyses were weighted to obtain population-based estimates for each state. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The ability to schedule an appointment and number of days to the appointment. We also examined cost and payment required at the visit for the uninsured.

Across the 10 states, 84.7% (95%CI, 82.6%-86.8%) of privately insured and 57.9%(95%CI, 54.8%-61.0%) of Medicaid callers received an appointment. Appointment rates were 78.8% (95%CI, 75.6%-82.0%) for uninsured patients with full cash payment but only 15.4%(95%CI, 13.2%-17.6%) if payment required at the time of the visit was restricted to $75 or less. Conditional on getting an appointment, median wait times were typically less than 1 week (2 weeks in Massachusetts), with no differences by insurance status or urgency of health concern. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Although most primary care physicians are accepting new patients, access varies widely across states and insurance status. Navigator programs are needed, not only to help patients enroll but also to identify practices accepting new patients within each plan's network. Tracking new patient appointment availability over time can inform policies designed to strengthen primary care capacity and enhance the effectiveness of the coverage expansions with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the spillover effects of the rate of uninsurance in a community on the awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension, a chronic condition responsible for substantial morbidity and mortality in the United States, among insured adults. RESEARCH DESIGN: NHANES III (1988-1994) and the 1999-2010 NHANES were linked to data from the Current Population Survey, Area Resource File, and InterStudy Competitive Edge. Multivariate probit regression models used 2 alternative estimation approaches: (1) maximum likelihood estimation, and (2) 2-stage residual inclusion estimation, an instrumental variables method. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Six dichotomous outcomes included: awareness among all subjects with hypertension; treatment among all subjects with hypertension and among subjects who were aware of their condition; and control among all subjects with hypertension, among subjects who were aware of their condition, and among subjects receiving treatment. RESULTS: A 10 percentage point increase in the community uninsurance rate reduced the probability of receiving antihypertensive medications by 4.2 percentage points among insured hypertensive adults and by 5.5 percentage points among insured hypertensive adults who were aware of their hypertension. A 10 percentage point increase in the community uninsurance rate also resulted in a 6.8 percentage point decline in the probability of blood pressure control among insured hypertensive adults who were aware of their condition. CONCLUSIONS: Nationally, the Affordable Care Act is expected to reduce the number of uninsured by >30 million by 2016, although changes will be experienced by communities to a greater or lesser extent depending on the existing numbers and characteristics of the uninsured in the area and the ways in which health care reform is implemented. Our results suggest that reductions in the community uninsurance rate have the potential to improve quality of care and clinical outcomes among the insured.

Patients choosing health plans rely on the accuracy of network directories posted by insurers. TheMA plans must meet network adequacy requirements, and inaccurate directories of participating physicians might prejudice those determinations.OBJECTIVE: To determine the accuracy ofMA plan directories of participating dermatologists, and the appointment availability of listed physicians.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Scripted telephone callswere placed to every dermatologist listed in directories for the largest MA plans in 12 US metropolitan areas. The caller sought an appointment on behalf of his fictitious father who had severe itch for several months, asked whether the dermatologist accepted the relevant plan, and asked for the next available appointment date.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Appointment availability andwait time.RESULTS: Among 4754 total physician listings, 45.5%represented duplicates in the same plan directory. Among the remaining unique listings, 48.9% of physicians were reachable, accepted the listed plan, and offered an appointment for our fictitious patient. Many of the dermatologists listed had incorrect contact information, were deceased, retired, or had moved, were not accepting new patients, did not accept the insurance plan, or were subspecialized. The mean (range) wait time for appointments among the remaining listings was 45.5 (1-414) days. Both the accuracy of network directories and the appointment wait times varied substantially by health plan and metropolitan area. For 1 plan, our caller was unable to obtain an appointment with any listed dermatologist.CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Medicare Advantage physician directories for dermatology in many areas substantially overestimate the number of in-network physicians available to treat patients with medical skin conditions. These inaccuracies occurred in areas with long appointment wait times and where plans are terminating selected physician contracts. This suggests a lack of capacity that would be exacerbated by further network narrowing. Accurate physician directories are essential for proper oversight of network adequacy, and for patients who rely on these listings to evaluate health plan options during open enrollment. © 2014 American Medical Association.

The military health system also covers dependents of active duty personnel, military retirees, and their dependents, including some members of the reserve components. The military health system provides health care services through either Department of Defense (DOD) medical facilities, known as ""military treatment facilities"" or ""MTFs"" as space is available, or through private health care providers. The military health system serves 9.7 million beneficiaries through care purchased from private providers as well as directly through a system of DOD military treatment facilities that currently includes some 56 hospitals and 365 clinics. It operates worldwide and employs some 58,369 civilians and 86,007 military personnel. Since 1966, civilian care to millions of dependents and retirees (and retirees' dependents) has been provided through a program still known in law as the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS), but more commonly known as TRICARE. TRICARE has four main benefit plans: a health maintenance organization option (TRICARE Prime), a preferred provider option (TRICARE Extra), a fee-for-service option (TRICARE Standard), and a Medicare wraparound option (TRICARE for Life) for Medicare-eligible retirees. Other TRICARE plans include TRICARE Young Adult, TRICARE Reserve Select and TRICARE Retired Reserve. TRICARE also includes a pharmacy program and optional dental plans. Options available to beneficiaries vary by the beneficiary's duty status and location. This report answers several frequently asked questions about military health care, including • How is the military health system structured? • What is TRICARE? • What are the different TRICARE plans and who is eligible? • What are the costs of military health care to beneficiaries? • What is the relationship of TRICARE to Medicare? • How does the Affordable Care Act affect TRICARE? • What are the long-term trends in defense health care costs? • What is the Medicare Eligible Retiree Health Care fund, which funds TRICARE for Life?

For example, recent Gallup polls have shown significant awareness of the Court’s decision on the National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius (2012) – commonly referred to as the Affordable Care Act case – and, in fact, that people changed their views specifically toward Chief Justice John Roberts. Moreover, recent research has also dispelled the notion that the public is “woefully ignorant” about the Supreme Court (Gibson and Caldeira 2009). Instead, they find widespread knowledge about the Court. This finding is consistent with other work that found significantly high levels of knowledge in the local communities that generated the court cases (Hoekstra 2000, 2003) as well as knowledge of some national cases (Franklin and Kosaki 1995; Franklin, Kosaki, and Kritzer 1995). Obviously, but importantly, it is the mass media that contribute to this knowledge since the Court remains one of the most reclusive of political institutions. Therefore, understanding the nature of mass media coverage of the Supreme Court is essential to understanding how the public perceives the Court and the decisions it announces. As important as this link is, the overwhelming majority of research on the impact of Court decisions on public opinion and support for the institution itself overlooks the important role of the news media. In the research that does address some aspect of the media, they still get short shrift in one of two ways. First, much of the research is more interested in understanding the causal links between the Supreme Court and public opinion by comparisons with other institutions or across issues (Hoekstra 1995; Mondak 1991). The ways that media actually cover decisions is not usually central to the analysis. Second, although some research examines the quantity and quality of media coverage of the Supreme Court, it often fails to connect that to public opinion (e.g., Slotnick and Segal 1998; Davis 1987). The research we present in this chapter attempts to look directly at how media coverage influences how the public responds to Court opinions. © Richard Davis 2014."

Biosimilars are anticipated to increase treatment options and lower the growth in spending on biologicals. How the commercial prospects for biosimilars will play out in the US is uncertain. From a regulatory, approvals, and market standpoint, Europe is ahead of the US with respect to biosimilars. Lessons may be drawn from European experience. Objective: To examine challenges and opportunities with respect to market uptake of biosimilars in the US. Methods: We reviewed Medline-indexed manuscripts and grey literature published in the past five years on the topics of biosimilar development and market uptake. The data collected in this review informed the development of two stakeholder surveys for payers and physicians. Main Survey Results: Almost all physicians surveyed believe that if a biosimilar is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the product will perform similarly to the originator biological with regard to safety and efficacy. Most physicians say they will likely prescribe biosimilars as soon as they are approved by FDA. Additionally, the majority of physicians feel comfortable switching an existing patient from the originator biological to a biosimilar. All payer respondents intend to promote biosimilar uptake by differentiating between the originator biological and biosimilar through the use of formulary tiering to steer patients and physicians towards biosimilars. Most payers said they would recommend therapeutic switching of biosimilars. Seventy-five per cent of payer respondents expect biosimilars to have a 15-35% price discount. Discussion: Physicians will display caution when deciding on prescribing biosimilars to existing patients. Payers will look to regulatory authority guidance for further support. To maximize cost savings, payers will likely employ formulary management tools, such as higher cost sharing for originators and lower cost sharing for biosimilars. To ensure access to and monitoring of post-marketing safety and effectiveness of biosimilars, payers may establish patient registries through coverage with evidence development arrangements. The expected price discount of 15-35% for biosimilars is not large. Furthermore, higher rebates on originator biologicals may be used by manufacturers as a barrier to adopting biosimilars. Therefore, biosimilar manufacturers will likely have to treat biosimilars as any other branded product. Finally, biosimilars will be subject to competition from new biologicals in the same therapeutic class, including incremental improvements to existing originators © 2014 Pro Pharma Communications International."

The Affordable Care Act will bring rapid changes to the health care system in 2014. We analyzed the Gallup-Healthways' Well-Being Index (WBI) in order to assess its ability to provide real-time estimates of the impact of the ACA on key health-related outcomes. Methods: We compared the Gallup-Healthways WBI to established surveys on demographics, health insurance, access to care, and health. Data sources were the Gallup-Healthways WBI, the Current Population Survey, the American Community Survey, the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, the National Health Interview Survey, and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Demographic measures included age, race/ethnicity, education, and income. Insurance outcomes were coverage rates by type, state, and year. Access measures included having a usual source of care and experiencing cost-related delays in care. Health measures were self-reported health and history of specific diagnoses. Results: Most differences across surveys were statistically significant (p<0.05) due to large sample sizes, so our analysis focused on the absolute magnitude of differences. The Gallup-Healthways WBI post-weighted sample was similar in age, race/ethnicity, and education to other surveys, though the Gallup-Healthways WBI sample is slightly older, has fewer minorities, and is more highly educated than in other national surveys. In addition, income was more frequently missing. The Gallup-Healthways WBI produced similar national, state, and time-trend estimates on uninsured rates, but far lower rates of public coverage. Access to care and health status were similar in the Gallup-Healthways WBI and other surveys. Conclusions: The Gallup-Healthways WBI is a valuable complement to existing data sources for health services research. The Gallup-Healthways WBI estimates for uninsured rates and access to care were similar to established national surveys and may allow for rapid estimates of the ACA's impact on the uninsured in 2014. Estimates of insurance type are less comparable, particularly for public coverage, which likely limits the utility of the Gallup-Healthways WBI for analyzing changes in particular types of coverage. © 2014."
