Methods: A cross-sectional analysis was conducted using data from 2006-2009 and 2011 waves of the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. A difference-in-difference analysis was used to compare changes in full-year private health insurance coverage among young adults aged 19-25 years with an older cohort aged 27-34 years. Separate regressions were estimated for individuals in metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas and were tested for a differential impact by area of residence. Findings: Full-year private health insurance coverage significantly increased by 9.2 percentage points for young adults compared to the older cohort after the ACA mandate (P =.00). When stratifying the regression model by residence area, insurance coverage among young adults significantly increased by 9.0 percentage points in metropolitan areas (P =.00) and 10.1 percentage points in nonmetropolitan areas (P =.03). These changes were not significantly different from each other (P =.82), which suggests the ACA mandate's effects were not statistically different by area of residence. Conclusions: Although young adults in metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas experienced increased access to private health insurance following the ACA's dependent coverage mandate, it did not appear to directly impact rural-urban disparities in health insurance coverage. Despite residents in both areas gaining insurance coverage, over one-third of young adults still lacked access to full-year health insurance coverage. © 2016 National Rural Health Association"

As a result, for many low-income adults, there has been stark variation across states in access to Medicaid since the expansions took effect in 2014. This study investigates whether individuals migrate in order to gain access to these benefits. Using an empirical model in the spirit of a difference-in-differences, this study finds that migration from non-expansion states to expansion states did not increase in 2014 relative to migration in the reverse direction. The estimates are sufficiently precise to rule out a migration effect that would meaningfully affect the number of enrollees in expansion states, which suggests that Medicaid expansion decisions do not impose a meaningful fiscal externality on other states. © 2016 by the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management"

This paper estimates the causal effects of the ACA on health insurance coverage in 2014 using data from the American Community Survey. We utilize difference-in-difference-in-differences models that exploit cross-sectional variation in the intensity of treatment arising from state participation in the Medicaid expansion and local area pre-ACA uninsured rates. This strategy allows us to identify the effects of the ACA in both Medicaid expansion and non-expansion states. Our preferred specification suggests that, at the average pre-treatment uninsured rate, the full ACA increased the proportion of residents with insurance by 5.9 percentage points compared to 2.8 percentage points in states that did not expand Medicaid. Private insurance expansions from the ACA were due to increases in both employer-provided and non-group coverage. The coverage gains from the full ACA were largest for those without a college degree, non-whites, young adults, unmarried individuals, and those without children in the home. We find no evidence that the Medicaid expansion crowded out private coverage. © 2016 by the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management"

The passage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in 2010 was a watershed event and many states have taken advantage of opportunities created by the ACA to expand healthcare coverage to their poorest residents, and to develop partnerships between health and justice systems. Yet to date, only four have taken advantage of the benefits of healthcare reform. Expanding Medicaid would provide Southern states with the opportunity to significantly impact health outcomes for criminal justice-involved individuals. In the context of an uncertain policy landscape, we suggest the use of three strategies, focusing on advancing incremental change while safeguarding existing gains, rebranding Medicaid as a local or statewide initiative, and linking Medicaid expansion to criminal justice reform, in order to implement Medicaid expansion across the South. © 2017, The Author(s)."

While research has addressed the impact of tobacco control on individual tobacco consumption, largely overlooked in the literature is the potential impact of state tobacco control policies on availability of services for tobacco cessation. This paper examines the association between state tobacco control policy and availability of TC services in SUD treatment programs in the United States. Methods State tobacco control and state demographic data (n = 51) were merged with treatment program data from the 2012 National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services (n = 10.413) to examine availability of TC screening, counseling and pharmacotherapy services in SUD treatment programs using multivariate logistic regression models clustered at the state-level. Results Approximately 60% of SUD treatment programs offered TC screening services, 41% offered TC counseling services and 26% offered TC pharmacotherapy services. Results of multivariate logistic regression showed the odds of offering TC services were greater for SUD treatment programs located in states with higher cigarette excise taxes and greater spending on tobacco prevention and control. Conclusions Findings indicate cigarette excise taxes and recommended funding levels may be effective policy tools for increasing access to TC services in SUD treatment programs. Coupled with changes to insurance coverage for TC under the Affordable Care Act, state tobacco control policy tools may further reduce tobacco use in the United States. © 2017"

We find in a nationally representative U.S. panel study (n = 9418 participants from 1995 to 2007–2008 in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent and Adult Health) that young adult children of incarcerated mothers are less likely to receive the health care they need. These effects hold in models that take into account covariates and receipt of health care in the past, a useful control for unmeasured heterogeneity. In this analysis for 2007–2008, economic marginality mediates maternal incarceration on young adult unmet health care needs. Health insurance mediates a smaller portion of this effect. The findings of this research provide important bench marks for assessing the effects of the 2010 passage and the 2013 implementation of the Affordable Care Act [ACA], as well as prospective efforts to change or repeal the ACA. © 2017"

Whereas voluntary choice of doctor and hospital used to be framed as an American right, contemporary choice rhetoric includes consumer choice of insurance plan. Understanding who has deployed choice rhetoric and to what ends helps explain how offering choices has become the common sense justification for defending and preserving the exclusionary health care system in the United States. Four case studies derived from 180 enrollment observations at the Rhode Island health insurance exchange conducted from March 2014–January 2017 and interviews with enrollees show how choice is experienced in this latest iteration of health reform. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) of 2010 created new pathways to insurance coverage in the United States. Insurance exchanges were supposed to unleash the power of consumer decision-making through marketplaces where health plans compete on quality, coverage, and price. Consumers, however, contended with confusing insurance terminology and difficult to navigate websites. The ethnography shows that consumers experienced choice as confusing and overwhelming and did not feel “in charge” of their decisions. Instead, unstable employment, changes in income, existing health needs, and bureaucratic barriers shaped their “choices.” © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"

We provide the first comprehensive assessment of these provisions’ effects, using the 2012–2015 American Community Survey and a triple-difference estimation strategy that exploits variation by income, geography, and time. Overall, our model explains 60% of the coverage gains in 2014–2015. We find that coverage was moderately responsive to price subsidies, with larger gains in state-based insurance exchanges than the federal exchange. The individual mandate's exemptions and penalties had little impact on coverage rates. The law increased Medicaid among individuals gaining eligibility under the ACA and among previously-eligible populations (“woodwork effect”) even in non-expansion states, with no resulting reductions in private insurance. Overall, exchange premium subsidies produced 40% of the coverage gains explained by our ACA policy measures, and Medicaid the other 60%, of which 1/2 occurred among previously-eligible individuals. © 2017 Elsevier B.V."

The Affordable Care Act includes the Hospital Readmission Reduction Program, which calls for reduced payments to hospitals with excessive readmissions. This policy uses a method to determine excess readmission ratios and calculate readmission payment adjustments to hospitals, however, it is unclear whether readmission rates are an effective quality metric. The reasons or conditions associated with readmission after elective THA have been well established but the extent to which readmissions can be prevented after THA remains unclear. Questions/purposes: (1) Are unplanned readmissions after THA associated with orthopaedic or medical causes? (2) Are these readmissions preventable? (3) When during the course of aftercare are orthopaedic versus medical readmissions more likely to occur? Methods: We retrospectively evaluated all 1096 elective THAs for osteoarthritis performed between January 1, 2011 and June 30, 2014 at a major academic medical center. Of those, 69 patients (6%) who met inclusion criteria were readmitted in our healthcare system within 90 days of discharge after the index procedure during the study period. Fifty patients were readmitted within 30 days of discharge after the index procedure (5%). We defined a readmission as any unplanned inpatient or observation status admission to the hospital spanning at least one midnight. A panel of physicians not involved in the care of these patients used available criteria and existing consensus guidelines to evaluate the medical records, radiographs, and operative reports to identify whether the underlying reason for readmission was orthopaedic versus medical. They subsequently were classified as either nonpreventable or potentially preventable readmissions, based on any care that may have occurred during the index hospitalization. To make such determinations, consensus specialty society guidelines were used whenever possible for each readmission diagnosis. Results: A total of 50 of 1096 patients (5% of those who underwent THA during the period in question) were readmitted within 30 days and 69 of 1096 (6%) were readmitted within 90 days of their index procedures. Thirty-one patients were readmitted for orthopaedic reasons (31/69; 45%) and 38 of 69 were readmitted for medical reasons (55%). Three readmissions (three of 69; 4%) were identified as potentially preventable. Of these potentially preventable readmissions, one was orthopaedic (hip dislocation) and two were medical. Thirty-day readmissions were more likely to be orthopaedic than 90-day readmissions (odds ratio, 4.06; 95% CI, 1.18–13.96; p = 0.026). Conclusions: Using a panel of expert reviewers, available existing criteria, and consensus methodology, it appears only a small percentage of readmissions after THA are potentially preventable. Orthopaedic readmissions occur earlier during the postoperative course. Currently, existing policies and readmission penalties may not serve as valuable external quality metrics. The readmission rates in our study may represent the threshold for expected readmission rates after THA. Future studies should enroll larger numbers of patients and have independent review panels in efforts to refine criteria for what constitutes preventable readmissions.

The Affordable Care Act (ACA), passed in 2010 and fully implemented in 2014, was intended to expand coverage and bring about a new era of health-care access. In this review, we evaluate the legislation's impact on health-care equity. We consider the law's coverage expansion, insurance market reforms, cost and affordability provisions, and delivery-system reforms. Although the ACA improved coverage and access—particularly for poorer Americans, women, and minorities—its overall impact was modest in comparison with the gaps present before the law's implementation. Today, 29 million people in the USA remain uninsured, and substantial inequalities in access along economic, gender, and racial lines persist. Although most Americans agree that further reform is needed, the proper direction for reform—especially following the 2016 presidential election—is highly contentious. We discuss proposals for change from opposite sides of the political spectrum, together with their potential impact on health equity. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"

A recent complaint filed against health insurers in seven states alleges that some health insurance companies have been using benefit designs that discourage enrollment of people living with HIV either by not covering essential HIV medications or by requiring cost-sharing for these prohibitively expensive medications. Legislators across the country have reacted by introducing legislation to address these growing problems. This paper describes Assembly Bill 339, legislation passed in California in 2015 and going into effect on 1 January 2017, which provides protection for people living with HIV by requiring coverage for single-tablet regimens to manage HIV while placing a cap on patient cost-sharing.

The life expectancy of the wealthiest Americans now exceeds that of the poorest by 10–15 years. This report, part of a Series on health and inequality in the USA, focuses on how the health-care system, which could reduce income-based disparities in health, instead often exacerbates them. Other articles in this Series address population health inequalities, and the health effects of racism, mass incarceration, and the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Poor Americans have worse access to care than do wealthy Americans, partly because many remain uninsured despite coverage expansions since 2010 due to the ACA. For individuals with private insurance, rising premiums and cost sharing have undermined wage gains and driven many households into debt and even bankruptcy. Meanwhile, the share of health-care resources devoted to care of the wealthy has risen. Additional reforms that move forward, rather than backward, from the ACA are sorely needed to mitigate health and health-care inequalities and reduce the financial burdens of medical care borne by non-wealthy Americans. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"

The purpose of this exploratory study was twofold. First, it examined the rural trends and patterns of immunization rates before (2008–2009) and after (2010–2013) the Affordable Care Act (ACA) enactment by state and year. Second, it investigated how contextual, organizational, and aggregate patient characteristics may influence the variations in immunization for influenza and pneumonia of Medicare beneficiaries served by RHCs. Four data sources from federal agencies were merged to perform a longitudinal analysis of the influences of contextual, organizational, and aggregate patient characteristics on the disparities in immunization rates of rural Medicare beneficiaries for influenza and pneumonia. We included both time-varying and time-constant predictors in a multivariate analysis using Generalized Estimating Equation. This study revealed the increased immunization rates for both influenza and pneumonia over a period of 6 years. The ACA had a positive effect on increased immunization rates for pneumonia, but not for influenza, in rural Medicare beneficiaries in the eight states. The RHCs that served more dually-eligible patients had higher immunization rates. For influenza immunization, provider-based RHCs had a higher rate than the independent RHCs. For pneumonia immunization, no organizational variables were relevant in the explanation of the variability. The results also showed that no single dominant factor influenced health care disparities. This investigation suggested further improvements in preventive care are needed to target poor and isolated rural beneficiaries. Furthermore, the integration of immunization data from multiple sources is critically needed for understanding health disparities. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media New York"

Multivariate regression models were used to evaluate insurance status that was reported pre- and post-ACA; self-reported impact of ACA on HIV care was explored with descriptive statistics. The likelihood of having insurance was significantly greater post-ACA compared to pre-ACA in Chicago (aRR = 1.33, 95%CI = 1.20, 1.47), Washington (aRR = 1.15, 95%CI = 1.08, 1.22), and Virginia (aRR = 1.14, 95%CI = 1.00, 1.29). In Washington and Chicago, the likelihood of being Medicaid-insured was greater post-ACA compared to pre-ACA implementation (Chicago: aRR = 1.25, 95%CI = 1.03,1.53; Washington: aRR = 1.66 95% CI = 1.30, 2.13). No other significant differences were observed. Only a subset of HIV care patients (range: 15–35%) reported a change in insurance that would have coincided with the implementation of ACA; and within this subset, a change in medical care costs was the most commonly noted issue. In conclusion, the influence of ACA on insurance coverage and other factors affecting HIV care likely varies by jurisdiction. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

Conclusions: There is a growing awareness of the importance of cognitive health and disability, and of the importance of measurement of cognitive functions across the lifespan. For example, cognitive screening has been mandated by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, and language contained within new psychiatric diagnostic criteria and healthcare regulatory changes reflect increased consideration of the importance of measurement of cognition.

Method: We searched for articles published between 1992 and 2015 using key word terminology related to employment support services and each subgroup, and prioritized articles by study design. Results: The individual placement and support model of supported employment is more effective than traditional vocational programs in helping people with serious mental illnesses who are engaged in treatment or receiving disability benefits obtain competitive employment. Some early intervention programs effectively serve people who experience a first episode of mental illness, but more research is needed to demonstrate long-term outcomes. Less is known about the effectiveness of employment interventions in preventing unemployment and use of disability benefits among individuals at risk for job loss or long-term mental illness. Conclusions and Implications for Practice: States can fund employment supports to help prevent the need for disability benefit receipt by creatively combining federal sources, but the funding picture is imperfect. Medicaid expansion and other provisions of the Affordable Care Act may fund employment supports and assist in reducing dependence on disability benefits.

The electronic health record (EHR) provides new opportunities to quantify health outcomes. Objective: To assess changes in biomarkers of chronic disease among community health center (CHC) patients who gained Medicaid coverage with the Oregon Medicaid expansion (2008–2011). Design: Prospective cohort. Patients were followed for 24 months, and rate of mean biomarker change was calculated. Time to a controlled follow-up measurement was compared using Cox regression models. Setting/Patients: Using EHR data from OCHIN (a non-profit network of CHCs) linked to state Medicaid data, we identified three cohorts of patients with uncontrolled chronic conditions (diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia). Within these cohorts, we included patients who gained Medicaid coverage along with a propensity score-matched comparison group who remained uninsured (diabetes n = 608; hypertension n = 1244; hyperlipidemia n = 546). Main Measures: Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) for the diabetes cohort, systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP, respectively) for the hypertension cohort, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) for the hyperlipidemia cohort. Key Results: All cohorts improved over time. Compared to matched uninsured patients, adults in the diabetes and hypertension cohorts who gained Medicaid coverage were significantly more likely to have a follow-up controlled measurement (hazard ratio [HR] =1.26, p = 0.020; HR = 1.35, p < 0.001, respectively). No significant difference was observed in the hyperlipidemia cohort (HR = 1.09, p = 0.392). Conclusions: OCHIN patients with uncontrolled chronic conditions experienced objective health improvements over time. In two of three chronic disease cohorts, those who gained Medicaid coverage were more likely to achieve a controlled measurement than those who remained uninsured. These findings demonstrate the effective care provided by CHCs and the importance of health insurance coverage within a usual source of care setting.

An open question remains concerning how the increasing rationalization of healthcare over the past few decades influences brokerage for undocumented immigrant patients. Drawing from fieldwork and interviews conducted in California, as the Affordable Care Act (ACA) was implemented, I develop the concept of the “double-embedded-liaison.” While other studies treat brokers as acting either as gatekeepers or patient representatives, this study explains how brokers simultaneously operate on multiple planes when new roles are added. I argue that with more formalization and scrutiny at health centers, the impact of brokerage is destabilized and, subsequently, diminished. Two consequences of the double-embedded-liaison brokerage form are: (1) some brokers become disillusioned and exit –resulting in the loss of valuable resources at the health centers, and (2) immigrants move away from the health centers that historically served them. In looking at brokers’ simultaneous performance as gatekeepers and representatives, this research extends brokerage typologies and street-level bureaucracy arguments that largely treat brokerage in a mono-planar rather than in a bi-planar mode. Furthermore, in examining the risks and opportunities brokerage brings to addressing health disparities, the study provides insights into the effects of replacing the ACA or repealing it all together in the Post-Obama era. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"

This policy's implications for patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) are unknown. Methods: The CF Foundation Patient Registry was used to identify patients seen at CF centers, 3 years before and after ACA implementation. Patients were grouped according to eligibility for the dependent care provision (18–25 years old in 2010) or ineligibility (26–35 years old). Year-level difference-in-difference logistic regressions evaluated the association between ACA enactment and insurance status (private, public, or no insurance). Routine annual care consistent with CF Foundation guidelines (≥4 clinic visits, ≥4 respiratory cultures, and ≥2 pulmonary function tests/year) was a secondary outcome. Results: The analysis included 4,024 and 3,132 patients in the eligible and ineligible groups, respectively (35,353 patient-years). In the eligible group, 62% had private insurance before and after ACA; 18% had public insurance before and after ACA; and 5% switched from public to private insurance. In the eligible group, lack of insurance coverage became more common in the post-ACA period (relative risk ratio vs. private insurance [RRR] = 1.95; 95%CI: 1.57, 2.43; P < 0.001). Public insurance coverage also became more common (RRR = 1.50; 95%CI: 1.39, 1.62; P < 0.001). Use of routine care increased post-ACA, but more strongly in the ineligible group than in the eligible group. Conclusions: The ACA dependent coverage provision did not increase private insurance coverage or use of routine care among CF patients who were potentially affected by this policy.

Bureau of Labor Statistics data were used to estimate employment. Study Design: We projected health insurance enrollment by plan type using a health plan choice model. Using claims data, we measured the services demanded for each plan choice and year. Projections of labor demand were based on current output/input ratios. Changes in wages resulting from changes in labor demand from 2014 to 2021 were based on labor supply and demand elasticities. Principal Findings: Expenditures required to retain and grow the health care workforce will increase substantially. Wages will increase most for professions with the greatest training requirements (physicians and registered nurses). The largest impact will be felt in 2015.

The authors analyzed trends over time in premiums and the number of dental insurers participating in the marketplaces. Methods The authors collected dental benefit plan data from 35 states participating in the federally facilitated marketplaces in 2014, 2015, and 2016. For each county, they counted the number of issuers offering stand-alone dental plans (SADPs) and medical plans with embedded pediatric dental benefits. They also analyzed trends in premiums. Results From 2014 through 2016, the number of issuers of stand-alone dental plans and medical plans with embedded pediatric dental benefits either did not change or increased in most counties. Average premiums for low–actuarial-value SADPs declined from 2014 through 2016. Conclusions The increase in the number of issuers of stand-alone dental plans and medical plans with embedded dental benefits may be associated with lower premiums. However, more research is needed to determine if this is the case.

Evidence on the effect of Medicaid expansion on access to surgical cancer care, a proxy for complex care, is sparse. Using New York's 2001 statewide Medicaid expansion as a natural experiment, we investigated how expansion affected use of surgical cancer care among beneficiaries overall and among racial minorities. Study Design From the New York State Inpatient Database (1997 to 2006), we identified 67,685 nonelderly adults (18 to 64 years of age) who underwent cancer surgery. Estimated effects of 2001 Medicaid expansion on access were measured on payer mix, overall use of surgical cancer care, and percent use by racial/ethnic minorities. Measures were calculated quarterly, adjusted for covariates when appropriate, and then analyzed using interrupted time series. Results The proportion of cancer operations paid by Medicaid increased from 8.9% to 15.1% in the 5 years after the expansion. The percentage of uninsured patients dropped by 21.3% immediately after the expansion (p = 0.01). Although the expansion was associated with a 24-case/year increase in the net Medicaid case volume (p < 0.0001), the overall all-payer net case volume remained unchanged. In addition, the adjusted percentage of ethnic minorities among Medicaid recipients of cancer surgery was unaffected by the expansion. Conclusions Pre-ACA Medicaid expansion did not increase the overall use or change the racial composition of beneficiaries of surgical cancer care. However, it successfully shifted the financial burden away from patient/hospital to Medicaid. These results might suggest similar effects in the post-ACA Medicaid expansion. © 2017 American College of Surgeons"

While each state pursued a unique plan, there are similarities in the types of changes each state desired to make. Equally important to how a state modified their Medicaid programs is how a state talked about Medicaid and reform. We investigate whether the rhetoric that emerged in waiver states is unique, analyze whether the rhetoric is associated with particular waiver reforms, and consider the implications of our findings for the future of Medicaid policy making. We find that proponents in waiver states have convinced a conservative legislature that their reform is sufficiently innovative that they are not doing a Medicaid expansion, and not building on the traditional Medicaid program. Particularly striking is that none of these reforms are entirely new to the Medicaid program. While not new, the way in which waiver states have been allowed to implement many of the reforms is new and has become stricter. We find an emerging consensus utilized by conservative policy makers in framing the Medicaid expansion. Expansion efforts by conservative policy makers in other states have subsequently pushed this framing far to the right."

The effect of health insurance is much less clear: there has been little rigorous empirical research assessing whether health coverage has an independent impact on individual happiness. This topic is especially important in the US where recently an estimated 18 % of the non-elderly were uninsured and extension of coverage through means such as the Affordable Care Act has been controversial. The present study addresses this question. Drawing from a large survey that collected comprehensive health and personal information about the US adult population, controlling for a wide variety of factors known to influence well-being, and addressing the possible endogeneity of having health insurance, we find that individuals without health insurance coverage were less likely to be “very satisfied” or “satisfied” with life.

Methods One hundred fifty-eight unique customer service numbers were identified for insurers offering plans through the federal marketplace, augmented with four additional numbers representing the Connecticut state-run exchange. Using a standardized patient biography and the mystery-shopper technique, a single investigator posed as a purchaser and contacted each number, requesting information on breast health services coverage. Consistency of information provided by the representative with the ACA mandates (BRCA testing in high-risk women) or state-specific legislation (screening ultrasound in women with dense breasts) was determined. Results Insurer representatives gave BRCA test coverage information that was not consistent with the ACA mandate in 60.8% of cases, and 22.8% could not provide any information regarding coverage. Nearly half (48.1%) of insurer representatives gave coverage information about ultrasound screening for dense breasts that was not consistent with state-specific legislation, and 18.5% could not provide any information. Conclusions Insurance customer service representatives in the federal and state marketplaces frequently provide inaccurate coverage information about breast health services that should be covered under the ACA and state-specific legislation.

Young invincible is the label given to adults under thirty-five who opt not to purchase health insurance because they perceive that they will not need it and would rather spend their money elsewhere. As uninsurance rates climbed, policy makers tried to figure out who the uninsured were and why they lacked coverage. Young adults rightly assumed importance in these conversations because they were disproportionately represented among the uninsured and their numbers were growing. However, the term ""young invincible"" had the contradictory effect of centering a white, male, high-income chooser as the subject of health policy discourses rather than the far more diverse mix of people who make up the uninsured. This character was imputed preferences and tastes based in economic theory and in long-standing cultural ideals: he was a risk taker, overly optimistic, and preferred cash now to security later. We argue that this heightened concern over young invincibles distorts understanding of the demographics of people who do not have health insurance. It also stokes intergenerational conflict, and frames structural constraints and high prices as a simple consumer ""choice."""

Here, we argue that while federal policy is the originating force of whether these provisions are adopted, individual state decisions are made within a larger ecosystem. This ecosystem has two main components: (1) complementary and competing state and federal policies; and (2) medical provision by a variety of suppliers. Specifically, the merits, costs, and uncertainties associated with adopting these provisions cannot be considered by the states in a vacuum-they may interact with a large set of simultaneously launched or existing local, state, and federal policies aimed at ensuring access to medical care. They may also interact with specific state and federal reimbursement policies and other requirements facing local hospitals and medical providers. We illustrate by example how these interactions may have important implications for the diffusion of ACA provisions. One implication of this perspective is that future empirical work on the rate, determinants, and impacts of ACA coverage expansions on individual and aggregate well-being must incorporate systematic study of this complex public-private sector ecosystem."

First, we consider the policy feedback mechanism, which suggests that policy decisions have spillover effects that influence opinions in other states; residents in the home state then influence the decisions of elected officials. We find that both gubernatorial ACA announcements and grant activity increased support for the ACA in nearby states. Consistent with our expectations, however, only gubernatorial announcements respond to shifts in ACA support, presumably because it is a more salient policy than grant activity. Second, we test for the opinion learning mechanism, which suggests that shifts in public opinion in other states provide a signal to elected officials about the viability of decisions in their own state. We find evidence that states are more likely to emulate other states with similar ACA policy preferences when deciding about when to announce their decisions. Our results suggest that scholars and policy makers should consider how shifts in public support influence the spread of ideas across the American states."

Because insurers can no longer vary their offers of coverage based on applicants' health status, the ACA established a risk adjustment program to equalize health-related cost differences across plans. The ACA also established a temporary reinsurance program to subsidize high-cost claims. To assess the impact of these programs, we compared revenues to claims costs for insurers in the individual market during the first two years of ACA implementation (2014 and 2015), before and after the inclusion of risk adjustment and reinsurance payments. Before these payments were included, for the 30 percent of insurers with the highest claims costs, claims (not including administrative expenses) exceeded premium revenues by $90-$397 per enrollee per month. The effect was reversed after these payments were included, with revenues exceeding claims costs by $0-$49 per month. The risk adjustment and reinsurance programs were relatively well targeted in the first two years.

It uses the longitudinal 2008 Panel of the Survey of Income and Program Participation (N = 114,345) to describe age-specific patterns of disparity prior to the Affordable Care Act (ACA). A formal decomposition on increment–decrement life tables of insurance gain and loss shows that coverage disparities are predominately driven by minority groups’ greater propensity to lose the insurance that they already have. Uninsured African Americans were faster to gain insurance compared to non-Hispanic whites, but their high rates of insurance loss more than negated this advantage. Disparities from greater rates of loss among minority groups emerge rapidly at the end of childhood and persist throughout adulthood.

In this study we explored two current policy alternatives: extending federal funding for CHIP or enrolling children in the existing health insurance Marketplace plans. We simulated annual out-of-pocket expenses using detailed health plan data from CHIP and federally facilitated Marketplace plans for a nationally representative cohort of children with chronic conditions, conducting comparisons at four different percentage categories of the federal poverty level. If CHIP funding is not renewed and children with chronic conditions shift to coverage under Marketplace plans, their families face increased annual out-of-pocket expenses ranging from $233 at the lowest income levels to $2,472 at the highest income level of 251-400 percent of poverty. Families with children who have epilepsy, diabetes, or mood disorders may face the highest costs. Cost sharing for prescription drugs (25 percent) and hospitalizations (23 percent) account for much of the difference.

We found that low-income adults in states that provided dental benefits beyond emergency-only coverage were more likely to have had a dental visit in the past year, compared to low-income adults in states without such benefits. Among states that provided dental benefits and expanded their Medicaid program, regression-based estimates suggest that childless adults had a significant increase (1.8 percentage points) in the likelihood of having had a dental visit, while parents had a significant decline (8.1 percentage points). One possible explanation for the disparity is that after expansion, newly enrolled childless adults might have exhausted the limited dental provider capacity that was available to parents before expansion. Additional policy-level efforts may be needed to expand the dental care delivery system's capacity. © 2017 Project HOPE - The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc."

This article contends that engagement, an alternative rhetorical strategy where advocates address the same policy dimensions as their opponents, is a more promising approach. Extending the engagement literature to the elite context in which most ACA-related decisions are made, it argues that elite-level engagement necessitates the additional task of linking policy change to opponents' broader philosophical and policy goals. Current debates surrounding the application of sales taxes to electronic commerce-a policy arena that seems far removed from health care policy but overlaps with the ACA in ways that make it an appropriate source of lesson drawing-illustrate the potential of an engagement strategy. Recently, many conservative lawmakers who previously opposed policy change have instead embraced online sales taxes as a mechanism for additional tax cuts. Analogous connections may facilitate the diffusion of ACA provisions that presently receive hostile receptions in Republican-leaning states."

Health risk assessments (HRAs) are widely available online but have not been consistently used in healthcare systems to activate patients to participate in prevention programs aimed at improving lifestyle behaviors. Objectives The goal of this study is to test whether adding telephone-based coaching to use of a comprehensive HRA increases at-risk patients' activation and enrollment into a prevention program compared to HRA use alone. Methods Participants were randomized to either complete an HRA alone or in conjunction with a telephone coaching intervention. To be eligible Veterans had to have at least one modifiable risk factor (current smoker, overweight/obese, or physically inactive). The primary outcome is enrollment and participation in a prevention program by 6 months. Secondary outcomes include change in a Patient Activation Measure and Framingham Risk Score. Discussion This study is the first to test a web-based health risk assessment coupled with a health coaching intervention within a large healthcare system. Results from this study will help the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) implement its national plan to include comprehensive health risk assessments as a tool to engage Veterans in prevention. The results will also inform health systems outside VHA who seek to implement Medicare's advisement that health risk assessment become a mandatory component of care under the Affordable Care Act. © 2017"

The purpose of this study was to investigate the implementation of a PCMH model in nurse-led primary care practices and to identify facilitators and barriers to the implementation of this model. Methods Data were collected through in-depth interviews with providers and staff in nurse-led practices. Results These data suggest two categories of processes that facilitate the integration of PCMH in the nurse-led practice setting: patient-oriented facilitators and organizational facilitators. In addition, a number of barriers were identified to implementing the PCMH model. Overall, these practices creatively engaged in the transformation process by structuring themselves as a complex adaptive system and building upon the core principles of nurse-led care. Conclusion Since the core principles of nurse-led care map onto many of the same principles of the PCMH model, this study discusses the possibility that nurse-led practices may experience fewer barriers when transitioning into PCMHs. © 2017 Elsevier Inc."

As these states consider individual Medicaid reimbursement policies, the availability, effectiveness, and cost-benefit of lactation services must be evaluated. We conducted such an analysis for low-income mothers in North Carolina (NC), providing a model for other states. Methods First, we analyzed the distribution of NC International Board Certified Lactation Consultants (IBCLCs) and county-level breastfeeding rates among low-income infants. Logistic regression was used to examine the association between IBCLC density and 6-week breastfeeding duration. Finally, state advocates collaborated on a cost-benefit analysis of Medicaid coverage of IBCLCs. Results Maps of the NC breastfeeding support landscape indicate that IBCLCs are available to provide services to low-income women across the state. Compared to counties with no IBCLCs, those with high IBCLC density were found to have a 6-week breastfeeding prevalence ratio of 1.20 (95 % CI 1.12, 1.28). Medicaid reimbursement of IBCLCs showed an estimated annual cost savings of $2.33 million. Conclusions for Practice In one state without Medicaid expansion, we found that breastfeeding support resources are available across the state, high density IBCLC support is associated with increased breastfeeding by low-income mothers, and services are cost-effective. Our model for Medicaid reimbursement in NC provides a framework for states to improve equity in access to optimal lactation support. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York."

Data: Secondary data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) from 1993 to 2009 was used. Study design: A time-varying coefficient model was constructed using a binary outcome of no enrollment in health insurance plan versus enrolled. The independent variables included age, sex, education, income, work status, race, and number of health conditions. Smooth functions of odds ratios and time were used to produce odds ratio plots. Results: Significant time-varying coefficients were found for all the independent variables with the odds ratio plots showing changing trends except for a constant line for the categories of male, student, and having three health conditions. Some categories showed decreasing disparities, such as the income categories. However, some categories had increasing disparities in health insurance enrollment such as the education and race categories. Conclusions: As the Affordable Care Act is being gradually implemented, studies are needed to provide baseline information about disparities in access to health insurance, in order to gauge any changes in health insurance access. The use of time-varying coefficient models with BRFSS data can be useful in accomplishing this task. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

The extent to which health insurance can mitigate the effects of the social determinants of health on cancer care is unknown. METHODS: This study linked the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registries to US Census data to study patients diagnosed with the 4 leading causes of cancer deaths between 2007 and 2011. A county-level social determinant score was developed with 5 measures of wealth, education, and employment. Patients were stratified into quintiles, with the lowest quintile representing the most disadvantaged communities. Logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate associations and cancer-specific survival. RESULTS: A total of 364,507 patients aged 18 to 64 years were identified (134,105 with breast cancer, 106,914 with prostate cancer, 62,606 with lung cancer, and 60,882 with colorectal cancer). Overall, patients from the most disadvantaged communities (median household income, $42,885; patients below the poverty level, 22%; patients completing college, 17%) were more likely to present with distant disease (odds ratio, 1.6; P <.001) and were less likely to receive cancer-directed surgery (odds ratio, 0.8; P <.001) than the least disadvantaged communities (median income, $78,249; patients below the poverty level, 9%; patients completing college, 42%). The differences persisted across quintiles regardless of the insurance status. The effect of having insurance on cancer-specific survival was more pronounced in disadvantaged communities (relative benefit at 3 years, 40% vs 31%). However, it did not fully mitigate the effect of social determinants on mortality (hazard ratio, 0.75 vs 0.68; P <.001). CONCLUSIONS: Cancer patients from disadvantaged communities benefit most from health insurance, and there is a reduction in disparities in outcome. However, the gap produced by social determinants of health cannot be bridged by insurance alone. Cancer 2017;123:1219–1227. © 2016 American Cancer Society. © 2016 American Cancer Society"

The demand for culturally and linguistically competent health care is increasing in lockstep with this growth; however, the supply of doctors with skills and experience suited for this care is lagging. In particular, there is a major shortage of Latino Spanish-speaking physicians, and the gap between demand and supply is widening. The implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) has increased the capacity of the US healthcare system to care for the growing Latino Spanish-speaking population, through health insurance exchanges, increased funding for safety net institutions, and efforts to improve efficiency and coordination of care, particularly with Accountable Care Organizations and the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program. With these policies in mind, the authors discuss how the value of Latino Spanish-speaking physicians to the healthcare system has increased under the environment of the ACA. In addition, the authors highlight key efforts to increase the supply of this physician population, including the implementation of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Act, premedical pipeline programs, and academic medicine and medical school education initiatives to increase Latino representation among physicians. © 2017 W.

Evidence shows the mandate increased insurance coverage among affected young adults and also increased premiums for family health insurance policies. In this paper, we investigate the use of dependent tax exemptions as a mechanism families could use to pay for increased costs associated with expanded coverage. Using data on households from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, we use a difference-in-difference methodology comparing changes in the likelihood of being claimed as a dependent on a tax return for the 19–25 year olds affected by the coverage mandate compared to 16–18 year olds that were unaffected. We find a significant increase in dependent tax exemptions among 19–25 year olds following implementation of the dependent coverage mandate. Family income gains from switching an exemption from a young adult child to the parent would shift a substantial portion of young adult insurance coverage costs (ultimately medical costs) to other taxpayers. Though we point to family health insurance cost as a likely driver of the increased dependent tax exemptions, we cannot rule out a role for other outcomes also affected by the mandate, including labor market changes among 19–25 year olds. We further compare the overall social costs and benefits of the mandate and show that absent significant health improvement to date, welfare gains likely depend on the positive contribution of young adults to insurance pools in terms of lower average costs. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media New York"

To illustrate such consequences of means-tested subsidies of health insurance premiums, we construct hypothetical households earning different levels of income who are eligible for current subsidies in the USA. and compare the estimated implicit marriage penalty faced by these households to the one faced by low-income households who are eligible for various means-tested programmes (e.g. TANF, WIC, SNAP) for each of the 48 contiguous states. We find that, like very low-income households, marriage can potentially penalize couples who receive health insurance premium subsidies by decreasing their overall disposable income by as much as 14%. We find that the ACA increases the number of households subject to marriage penalties embedded in means-tested programmes for low-income couples. This distortion will exist for any future health insurance premium subsidies that are means tested at the household income level. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group"

The idea to work through health extension agents to support health care delivery systems was based on the nationally known Cooperative Extension System (CES). Instead of creating new infrastructure in health care, the CES is an ideal vehicle for increasing health-related research and primary care delivery. APPROACH: The CES, a long-standing component of the land-grant university system, features a sustained infrastructure for providing education to communities. The Michigan State University (MSU) Model of Health Extension offers another means of developing a National Primary Care Extension Program that is replicable in part because of the presence of the CES throughout the United States. A partnership between the MSU College of Human Medicine and MSU Extension formed in 2014, emphasizing the promotion and support of human health research. The MSU Model of Health Extension includes the following strategies: building partnerships, preparing MSU Extension educators for participation in research, increasing primary care patient referrals and enrollment in health programs, and exploring innovative funding. OUTCOMES: Since the formation of the MSU Model of Health Extension, researchers and extension professionals have made 200+ connections, and grants have afforded savings in salary costs. NEXT STEPS: The MSU College of Human Medicine and MSU Extension partnership can serve as a model to promote health partnerships nationwide between CES services within land-grant universities and academic health centers or community-based medical schools.This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-No Derivatives License 4.0 (CCBY-NC-ND), where it is permissible to download and share the work provided it is properly cited.

Results showed treatment for OUDs was covered by nearly all health plan products in each year of the survey, but the types and patterns varied by year. Prior authorization requirements for OTPs have decreased over time. Despite the promise of expanded access to OUD treatment suggested by parity and the ACA, improved health plan coverage for treatment of OUDs, while essential, is not sufficient to address the opioid crisis. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC"

A multi-level mixed-effects regression model indicated that physicians practicing in states that were supportive of ACA, as indicated by adopting both the Medicaid expansion and implementing a state-based health insurance exchange, had more positive perceptions of the ACA than physicians in states that had declined both of these policies. This study suggests that state approaches to ACA may be associated with varied impacts. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC"

Between 2002 and 2013, drug overdose rates quadrupled. Parallel to an increase in prescription opioid overdose, heroin overdose deaths are increasing as patients shift to cheaper and more accessible heroin from the prescription opioids which physicians are prescribing less often due to increasing regulatory restrictions, as well as enhanced education and awareness. In many areas, the leading cause of death for young adults is drug overdose. Unlike previous heroin use in the U.S., the nexus of spread is coming primarily out of the medical system, as the line between legal and illicit narcotics has become blurred. The economic and social benefits of bringing the previously excluded addicted population into the mainstream health care system will be substantial and will bring changes in three major areas: mental health and substance abuse services in health plans; parity protection in all insurance plans; substance abuse and mental health services. Long-term implementation of these changes in a medically oriented system will require the development of many new systems and procedures. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC"

Our empirical results suggested that a negative correlation between defense and health spending persists over the entire period of 1941–2013 in the very long-run (over 16 years cycle), but there is a change in correlation between defense and health spending in the short-run (2–4 years cycle), medium-run (4–8 years cycle), and long-run (8–16 years cycle) during the same period. In particular, there appears to have been a trade-off relationship between defense and health spending during the ex-Korean War period, but there was a complementary relationship between defense and health spending during the post-Korean War period. The crowding-out effect of health spending on defense spending during the period when the Affordable Care Act was put into effect relies on the strength of the positive correlation in the long-run (8–16 years cycle) and negative correlation in the short-run (2–4 years cycle) and very long-run (over 16 years cycle). © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group"

Methods: We examined new members who enrolled in Kaiser Permanente Northern California through Medicaid, the California exchange, or nonexchange commercial plans (N=122,298) in the first 6 months of 2014 following ACA implementation. We compared these groups on smoking prevalence and tested whether smokers in each group differed on sociodemographic characteristics and in their utilization of tobacco treatment (pharmacotherapy and counseling) in 2014. Results: Smoking prevalence was higher among Medicaid (22%) than exchange (13%) or commercial (12%) patients (P<0.0001). Controlling for key sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, Medicaid (odds ratio, 1.49; 95% confidence interval, 1.29-1.73) smokers had greater odds of tobacco treatment use than commercial smokers. Other groups at risk for underuse included men, younger patients, Asians, and Latinos. Conclusions: In this cohort of newly enrolled patients after ACA implementation, Medicaid patients were more likely to be smokers compared with exchange and commercial patients, but they were also more likely to use tobacco treatment. Low tobacco treatment use among exchange and commercial plan smokers, as well as younger men, Asians and Latinos poses a significant obstacle to improving public health and additional targeted outreach strategies may be needed to engage these patients with available health services. © Copyright 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

We examined whether Medicaid expansions were associated with changes in insurance coverage, health care use, and health among low-income adults. METHODS: We compared changes in outcomes during the 2 years after implementation of the Medicaid expansion (2014 and 2015) relative to the 4 years before expansion (2010 through 2013) in states with and without expansions, using data from the National Health Interview Survey. The sample consisted of 60,766 U.S. citizens who were 19 to 64 years of age and had incomes below 138% of the federal poverty level. Outcomes included insurance coverage, access to and use of medical care in the past 12 months, and health status as reported by the respondents. RESULTS: A total of 29 states and Washington, D.C., expanded Medicaid by September 1, 2015. In year 2 after implementation, uninsurance rates were reduced in expansion states relative to nonexpansion states (difference-in-differences estimate, -8.2 percentage points; P<0.001) and rates of Medicaid coverage were increased (difference-in-differences estimate, 15.6 percentage points; P<0.001). Expansions were not associated with significant changes in the likelihood of a doctor visit or overnight hospital stay or health status as reported by the respondent. However, as compared with nonexpansion states, expansion states had a decrease in reports of inability to afford needed follow-up care (difference-in-differences estimate, -3.4 percentage points; P = 0.002) and in reports of worry about paying medical bills (difference-in-differences estimate, -7.9 percentage points; P = 0.002) and an increase in reports of medical care being delayed because of wait times for appointments (difference-in-differences estimate, 2.6 percentage points; P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Medicaid expansion was associated with increased insurance coverage and access to care during the second year of implementation, but it was also associated with longer wait times for appointments, which suggests that challenges in access to care persist.

These differences include increased incidence of infant mortality, childhood hospitalization, diabetes, mental and behavioral health problems, cardiovascular disease, and late-stage cancer diagnoses. These types of disparities could be addressed by identifying those individuals at greatest risk for chronic disease or higher mortality rates and improving their health literacy and access to care. However, this is only possible if health management organizations and care providers have accurate racial and ethnic information. As an initial step at better understanding the problem, a survey of demographic data for Ohio Medicaid beneficiaries was conducted. The results of the study revealed inconsistencies and omissions in reported race and ethnicity for nearly 10% of records received from the state. This trend was most evident among older adults and those joining under the Affordable Care Act’s Medicaid Expansion.

These guidelines are in addition to a European policy addressing disclosure of physician financial interests in the industry. Similarly, In the US, a national open payments program as well as Federal regulations under the Affordable Care Act re-address the issue of disclosure of physician financial interests in America. These new professional and legal changes make us rethink the fiduciary duties of providers working under new organizational and financial schemes, specifically their clinical fidelity and their moral and professional obligations to act in the best interests of patients. The article describes the legal changes providing the background for such proposals and offers a prima facie ethical analysis of these evolving issues. It is argued that although disclosure of conflicting interest may increase trust it may not necessarily be beneficial to patients nor accord with their expectations and needs. Due to the extra burden associated with disclosure as well as its implications on the medical profession and the therapeutic relationship, it should be held that transparency of physician financial interest should not result in mandatory disclosure of such interest by physicians. It could lead, as some initiatives in Europe and the US already demonstrate, to voluntary or mandatory disclosure schemes carried out by the industry itself. Such schemes should be in addition to medical education and the address of the more general phenomenon of physician conflict of interest in ethical codes and ethical training of the parties involved. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht"

Objective: To establish estimates of the exposure of the American patient population to physicians who accept industry payments, to compare these population-based estimates to physician-based estimates of industry contact, and to investigate Americans’ awareness of industry payments. Design: Cross-sectional survey conducted in late September and early October 2014, with data linkage of respondents’ physicians to Open Payments data. Participants: A total of 3542 adults drawn from a large, nationally representative household panel. Main Measures: Respondents’ contact with physicians reported in Open Payments to have received industry payments; respondents’ awareness that physicians receive payments from industry and that payment information is publicly available; respondents’ knowledge of whether their own physician received industry payments. Key Results: Among the 1987 respondents who could be matched to a specific physician, 65% saw a physician who had received an industry payment during the previous 12 months. This population-based estimate of exposure to industry contact is much higher than physician-based estimates from the same period, which indicate that 41% of physicians received an industry payment. Across the six most frequently visited specialties, patient contact with physicians who had received an industry payment ranged from 60 to 85%; the percentage of physicians with industry contact in these specialties was much lower (35–56%). Only 12% of survey respondents knew that payment information was publicly available, and only 5% knew whether their own doctor had received payments.

Challenges integrating IPE into health profession programmes include finding convenient times, meeting spaces, and level-appropriate assignments for each profession. This article describes the implementation of a 21-month prospective cohort study pilot programme for the Master of Science in nursing family nurse practitioner (FNP) and doctor of pharmacy (PharmD) students at a private university in the United States. This IPE experience utilised a blended approach for the learning activities; these students had initial and final sessions where they met face-to-face, with asynchronous online activities between these two sessions. The online assignments, discussions, and quizzes during the pilot programme involved topics such as antimicrobial stewardship, hormone replacement therapy, human papilloma virus vaccination, prenatal counselling, emergency contraception, and effects of the Affordable Care Act on practice. The results suggested that the FNP students held more favourable attitudes about online IPE and that the PharmD students reported having a clearer understanding of their own roles and those of the other participating healthcare students. However, the students also reported wanting more face-to-face interaction during their online IPE experience. Implications from this study suggest that effective online IPE can be supported by ensuring educational parity between students regarding the various topics discussed and a consistent approach of the required involvement for all student groups is needed. In addition, given the students desire for more face-to-face interaction, it may be beneficial to offer online IPE activities for a shorter time period. It is anticipated that this study may inform other programmes that are exploring innovative approaches to provide IPE to promote effective collaboration in patient care. © 2017 Taylor & Francis."

Objective: Assess the impact of the ACA's dependent care coverage expansion on young adult mortality rates. Research Design: Using the Multiple Cause Mortality public use database for 2008-2013, the impact of the ACA is examined with a difference-in-differences analysis of monthly mortality rates using individuals aged 26-30 as a natural control group for young adults aged 19-25. Results: The average monthly disease-related mortality rate of the 19-25 years old group fell by between 3.1% and 6.1% in the wake of the dependent care coverage expansion. Reduction in mortality was primarily in disease-related causes which are amenable to general medical care such as cardiovascular disease, while mortality due to trauma-related causes, which must be treated regardless of insurance status under preexisting laws, was unaffected. Conclusion: The reduction in mortality from this single provision of the ACA indicates that larger gains in preventable mortality could be made as health insurance coverage continues to expand under the ACA. © Copyright 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Registered nurses (nurses) are key players not only in providing direct patient care but also in evaluating the quality and safety of care provided to patients and families. PURPOSE:: We had the opportunity to study a unique cohort of nurses to understand more about the common predictors of nurse-reported quality of care and patient safety across acute care settings. APPROACH:: We analyzed cross-sectional survey data that were collected in 2015 from 731 nurses, as part of a national 10-year panel study of nurses. Variables selected for inclusion in regression analyses were chosen based on the Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety model, which is composed of work system or structure, process, and outcomes. RESULTS:: Our findings indicate that factors from three components of the Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety model–Work System (person, environment, and organization) are predictive of quality of care and patient safety as reported by nurses. The main results from our multiple linear and logistic regression models suggest that significant predictors common to both quality and safety were job satisfaction and organizational constraints. In addition, unit type and procedural justice were associated with patient safety, whereas better nurse-physician relations were associated with quality of care. CONCLUSION:: Increasing nurses’ job satisfaction and reducing organizational constraints may be areas to focus on to improve quality of care and patient safety. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS:: Our results provide direction for hospitals and nurse managers as to how to allocate finite resources to achieve improvements in quality of care and patient safety alike.

Methods: Longitudinal, retrospective review at a children's hospital was conducted for children with diagnosed asthma (ICD-9 493.xx), ages 2–18 years, scheduled for a PC visit between January 1, 2010, and June 30, 2012 (N = 3895).

Methods: Using data from the American Community Survey years 2011-2015, we conducted a difference-in-differences regression analysis to test for changes in the probability of low-income childless adults having insurance in states that expanded Medicaid versus states that did not expand, in rural versus urban areas. Analyses employed survey weights, adjusted for covariates, and included a set of falsification tests as well as sensitivity analyses. Findings: Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act increased the probability of Medicaid coverage for targeted populations in rural and urban areas, with a significantly greater increase in rural areas (P <.05), but some of these gains were offset by reductions in individual purchased insurance among rural populations (P <.01). Falsification tests showed that the insurance increases were specific to low-income childless adults, as expected, and were largely insignificant for other populations. Conclusions: The Medicaid expansion increased the probability of having “any insurance” for the pooled urban and rural low-income populations, and it specifically increased Medicaid coverage more in rural versus urban populations. There was some evidence that the expansion was accompanied by some shifting from individual purchased insurance to Medicaid in rural areas, and there is a need for future work to understand the implications of this shift on expenditures, access to care and utilization. © 2017 National Rural Health Association"

Each office was called four times to assess the responses for each payment type. From each call, whether an appointment was offered and barriers to an appointment were recorded. Results 21% of psychiatrists would see new patients. 15% of offices scheduled an appointment for a patient with Medicaid, compared to 34% for Medicare, 54% for BlueCross and 93% for cash pay (p < 0.001). Medicaid patients confronted more barriers to receiving appointments and had more trouble scheduling appointments in states with expanded Medicaid eligibility. The overall number of Medicaid patients who would be able to theoretically schedule an appointment in states with versus states without expanded Medicaid eligibility was approximately equivalent.

Non-Hispanic Black men were more likely to be prescribed HIV screening compared to non-Hispanic White men (odds ratio [OR] = 12.33, 95% confidence interval [CI; 4.42, 34.46]). Men who see primary care providers were more likely to be prescribed HIV screening compared to men not seeing a primary care provider (OR = 5.94, 95% CI [2.15, 16.39]). Men between the ages of 19 and 22 were more likely to be prescribed HIV screening compared to men between the ages of 15 and 18 (OR = 6.59, 95% CI [2.16, 20.14]). Men between the ages of 23 and 25 were more likely to be prescribed HIV screening compared with men between the ages of 15 and 18 (OR = 10.13, 95% CI [3.34, 30.69]). Health education programs identifying men at increased risk for contracting HIV may account for the increased screening rates in certain populations. Future research should examine age disparities surrounding adolescent and young men HIV screening. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016."

STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study using self-reported data of patients newly enrolled in Kaiser Permanente California and Kaiser Permanente Colorado through the ACA healthcare exchanges for coverage beginning January 1, 2014. METHODS: Baseline and follow-up surveys conducted via mail and telephone, with response rates of 45% and 51%, respectively. RESULTS: We found significant increases in the percentage of people who reported having a personal healthcare provider (59% vs 73%; P <.01) and significant decreases in those who reported delaying needed medical care due to costs (37% vs 25%; P <.01) before and after ACA enrollment. There was also a significant increase in the percentage of patients who reported receiving a flu shot during the prior year (41% vs 52%; P <.01). Among the people who reported having less than 4 months of healthcare coverage in 2013, these improvements were even more pronounced. This group also showed significant increases in the percentages who felt they had a place to go when they needed medical care (43% vs 56%; P <.01) and who reported they received advice to quit smoking or using tobacco (46% vs 72%; P <.05). CONCLUSIONS: These findings are an important addition to the evidence base that the ACA is improving the healthcare experience and reducing barriers due to costs for individuals obtaining insurance coverage through the healthcare exchanges."

Our objective was to determine whether a brief educational intervention about these provisions would increase interest in LARC use. Methods This is a cross-sectional survey of women seeking contraceptive care in an urban outpatient obstetrics/gynecology clinic. We collected baseline contraceptive attitudes and knowledge of the ACA's contraceptive coverage provisions before the intervention. Our primary outcome was interest in using a LARC method before and after reading a short description of the ACA's contraceptive coverage provisions. Results Surveys were completed by 316 participants. Most participants (52.8%) could not correctly identify any of the contraception coverage stipulations protected under the ACA. We observed a significant increase in LARC interest after the intervention in all participants (37.3% vs. 44.3%; p = .038), primarily among participants who did not originally identify any ACA provisions correctly (n = 167; 38.3% vs. 48.5%; p = .030). This subset also demonstrated a greater adjusted odds ratio of post-intervention LARC interest (odds ratio, 2.889; 95% CI, 1.234–6.723; p = .014). Interest in short-acting reversible contraception and contraception overall remained unchanged. Conclusions Most women seeking birth control lack comprehensive understanding of the contraceptive coverage protected by the ACA. Incorporating patient education about the ACA's no-cost contraception provision into routine contraceptive counseling may increase interest in LARC use and better enable women to make informed family planning decisions unrestrained by financial considerations. © 2016 Jacobs Institute of Women's Health"

The purpose of this analysis was: (1) to estimate the effect of the ACA LVH adjustment on qualifying hospitals’ profitability margins; and (2) to examine hospital and market characteristics of the hospitals that would be most adversely affected by the loss of the ACA LVH adjustment. Methods: 2004-2015 data from the Hospital Cost Report Information System, Hospital Market Service Area File and Nielsen-Claritas Pop-Facts file were used to estimate difference-in-difference regression models with hospital-level random effects in order to determine whether the ACA LVH adjustment improved qualifying rural hospitals’ profitability margins. Recycled predictions estimated the effect of losing the ACA LVH adjustment on profitability margins. Bivariate analyses explored associations between the predicted profitability margins and hospital and market characteristics. Findings: The ACA LVH adjustment significantly improved Sole Community Hospitals’ Medicare inpatient margins in the year they received the adjustment, and it had a large but statistically insignificant effect on the profitability margins of other rural hospitals. Hospitals that would be the most adversely affected by loss of the ACA LVH adjustment were more likely to be small, located in the South, and in high-poverty markets with higher proportions of black and uninsured individuals. Conclusions: Elimination of the ACA LVH adjustment would have differential effects on subgroups of hospitals, and those located in markets serving historically underserved populations would be the most adversely affected. © 2016 National Rural Health Association"

We extend research on uninsurance into the domain of sociologists by theorizing how uninsurance might exacerbate social inequalities and undermine social cohesion within communities.

It is, however, unclear if states’ provision standards for supply of mental health services will be able to accommodate this demand increase. Both the demand and supply of public mental health services vary within states; it is necessary to measure both locally. In this paper, we estimate the prevalence of mental illness within 30 geographical regions in the state of Virginia, a representative example of how many states organize their public mental health systems and how mental illness prevalence can be measured locally. Our methodology extends the analysis in Stern (Health Serv. Outcomes Res. Methods 14:109–155, 2014) by covering an entire state and accounting for peoples’ insurance status. The latter allows us to compare estimates of demand for public mental health services among those 30 geographical regions. We find that over 66,000 uninsured and Medicaid-insured individuals in Virginia are not provided with public mental health services. The deficit varies locally, with several regions having no deficit and others having 5000 or more untreated people. We also estimate that a large portion of the unserved people with mental illness are uninsured but would be insured for mental health services through Medicaid if Virginia were to accept the Medicaid expansion associated with the Affordable Care Act. These results provide evidence that there is significant variation in the demand for and public health systems’ ability to supply mental health services within states. This implies states can better serve populations relying on mental health care by allocating scarce public mental health dollars to localities reflecting their need. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York."

Such feedbacks are well documented around programs like Social Security that make explicit government transfers, but may be more limited around policies that—like the DCP—channel private-sector resources to their target populations. It is also unknown whether single provisions within multipronged policies can elicit feedbacks around the parent policy as a whole. This article tests whether 19–25-year-olds differ from adults aged 26–34 in support for the ACA, civic predisposition, political efficacy, and political participation in 2012.

The article then studies insured 19–25-year-olds in 2014, testing whether those using parental insurance differed from those using other insurance in ACA support, responses to threats to the ACA, and beliefs that the ACA is personally helpful. Young adults show virtually no signs of DCP-inspired political feedbacks. These results do not appear strictly attributable to the youth of this target population. Rather, feeble feedbacks may owe to ACA attitudes resting on factors other than the DCP, to Democrats failing to mobilize young adults, and to the DCP's limited ability to reach low-income earners. © 2017 Policy Studies Organization"

Health care reform has been a global issue over the years and the United States has seen proposals for multiple reforms over the years. A successful, health care proposal in the United States with involvement of the federal government was the short-lived establishment of the first system of national medical care in the South. In the 20th century, the United States was influenced by progressivism leading to the initiation of efforts to achieve universal coverage, supported by a Republican presidential candidate, Theodore Roosevelt. In 1933, Franklin D. Roosevelt, a Democrat, included a publicly funded health care program while drafting provisions to Social Security legislation, which was eliminated from the final legislation. Subsequently, multiple proposals were introduced, starting in 1949 with President Harry S Truman who proposed universal health care; the proposal by Lyndon B. Johnson with Social Security Act in 1965 which created Medicare and Medicaid; proposals by Ted Kennedy and President Richard Nixon that promoted variations of universal health care. presidential candidate Jimmy Carter also proposed universal health care. This was followed by an effort by President Bill Clinton and headed by first lady Hillary Clinton in 1993, but was not enacted into law. Finally, the election of President Barack Obama and control of both houses of Congress by the Democrats led to the passage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), often referred to as “ObamaCare” was signed into law in March 2010. Since then, the ACA, or Obamacare, has become a centerpiece of political campaigning.

The analysis of longitudinal data (2007 through 2013) in rural areas offers a unique opportunity to examine trends and patterns of rural disparities in hospital readmissions within 30 days of discharge among Medicare beneficiaries served by rural health clinics (RHCs) in the eight southeastern states of the Department of Health & Human Services (DHHS) Region 4. The purpose of this study is twofold: first, to examine rural trends and patterns of hospital readmission rates by state and year (before and after the ACA enactment); and second, to investigate how contextual (county characteristic), organizational (clinic characteristic) and ecological (aggregate patient characteristic) factors may influence the variations in repeat hospitalizations. The unit of analysis is the RHC. We used administrative data compiled from multiple sources for the Centers of Medicare and Medicaid Services for a period of seven years. From 2007 to 2008, risk-adjusted readmission rates increased slightly among Medicare beneficiaries served by RHCs. However, the rate declined in 2009 through 2013. A generalized estimating equation of sixteen predictors was analyzed for the variability in risk-adjusted readmission rates. Nine predictors were statistically associated with the variability in risk-adjusted readmission rates of the RHCs pooled from 2007 through 2013 together. The declined rates were associated with by the ACA effect, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and the percentage of elderly population in a county where RHC is located. However, the increase of risk-adjusted rates was associated with the percentage of African Americans in a county, the percentage of dually eligible patients, the average age of patients, and the average clinical visits by African American patients. The sixteen predictors accounted for 21.52 % of the total variability in readmissions. This study contributes to the literature in health disparities research from the contextual, organizational and ecological perspectives in the analysis of longitudinal data. The synergism of multiple contextual, organizational and ecological factors, as shown in this study, should be considered in the design and implementation of intervention studies to address the problem of hospital readmissions through prevention and enhancement of disease management of rural Medicare beneficiaries. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York."

Since its enactment, numerous claims have been made on both sides of the aisle regarding the ACA’s success or failure; these views often colored by political persuasion. The ACA had 3 primary goals: increasing the number of the insured, improving the quality of care, and reducing the costs of health care. One point often lost in the discussion is the distinction between affordability and access. Health insurance is a financial mechanism for paying for health care, while access refers to the process of actually obtaining that health care. The ACA has widened the gap between providing patients the mechanism of paying for healthcare and actually receiving it. The ACA is applauded for increasing the number of insured, quite appropriately as that has occurred for over 20 million people. Less frequently mentioned are the 6 million who have lost their insurance. Further, in terms of how health insurance is been provided, the majority the expansion was based on Medicaid expansion, with an increase of 13 million. Consequently, the ACA hasn’t worked well for the working and middle class who receive much less support, particularly those who earn more than 400% of the federal poverty level, who constitute 40% of the population and don’t receive any help. As a result, exchange enrollment has been a disappointment and the percentage of workers obtaining their health benefits from their employer has decreased steadily. Access to health care has been uneven, with those on Medicaid hampered by narrow networks, while those on the exchanges or getting employer benefits have faced high out-of-pocket costs. The second category relates to cost containment. President Obama claimed that the ACA provided significant cost containment, in that costs would have been even much higher if the ACA was not enacted. Further, he attributed cost reductions generally to the ACA, not taking into account factors such as the recession, increased out-of-pocket costs, increasing drug prices, and reduced coverage by insurers. The final goal was improvement in quality. The effort to improve quality has led to the creation of dozens of new agencies, boards, commissions, and other government entities. In turn, practice management and regulatory compliance costs have increased. Structurally, solo and independent practices, which lack the capability to manage these new regulatory demands, have declined. Hospital employment, with its associated increased costs, has been soaring. Despite a focus on preventive services in the management of chronic disease, only 3% of health care expenditures have been spent on preventive services while the costs of managing chronic disease continue to escalate. The ACA is the most consequential and comprehensive health care reform enacted since Medicare. The ACA has gained a net increase in the number of individuals with insurance, primarily through Medicaid expansion. The reduction in costs is an arguable achievement, while quality of care has seemingly not improved. Finally, access seems to have diminished. This review attempts to bring clarity to the discussion by reviewing the ACA’s impact on affordability, cost containment and quality of care. We will discuss these aspects of the ACA from the perspective of proponents, opponents, and a pragmatic point of view. © 2017, American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians.

Although numerous reforms have been proposed, universal principles to guide decisionmaking are lacking. Solving the challenges that confront us will be difficult, owing to intense partisan divisions and a dysfunctional political process. Nevertheless, we must engage in reasoned debate that respects deeply held differences of opinion regarding our individual and collective obligations to promote healthy living and ensure affordable access to health care. Otherwise, our decisions will be expressed through political processes that reflect the preferences of narrow interests rather than the general public. Our health care system can be made more efficient and equitable by incentivizing consumers and providers to utilize high-value care and avoid lowvalue care. To accomplish this, we must understand the determinants of consumer and provider behavior and implement policies that encourage, but do not force, optimal decision-making. Although distinguishing between low- and high-value treatments will invariably threaten established interests, we must expand our capacity to make such judgements. Throughout this process, consumers, taxpayers, and policy makers must maintain realistic expectations. Although realigning incentives to promote highvalue care will improve efficiency, it is unlikely to control increasing medical expenditures because they are not primarily caused by inefficiency. Rather, rising medical expenditures are driven by medical innovation made possible by increasing incomes and expanding health insurance coverage. Failure to recognize these linkages risks adopting indiscriminate policies that will reduce spending but slow innovation and impair access to needed care.

Despite professional consensus on recommended services for adolescents, a strong evidence base for services for young adults, and improved financial access to services with the Affordable Care Act's provisions, receipt of preventive services remains suboptimal. Further research that builds off successful models of linking traditional and community clinics is needed to improve access to care for all youth. To optimize the clinical encounter, promising clinician-focused strategies to improve delivery of preventive services include screening and decision support tools, particularly when integrated into electronic medical record systems and supported by training and feedback. Although results have been mixed, interventions have moved beyond increasing service delivery to demonstrating behavior change. Research on emerging technology—such as gaming platforms, mobile phone applications, and wearable devices—suggests opportunities to expand clinicians’ reach; however, existing research is based on limited clinical settings and populations.

Using data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, and a difference-in-differences model that compares states that did and did not expand Medicaid, we examine the impact of the expansions on preventive care (e.g., dental visits, immunizations, mammograms, cancer screenings), risky health behaviors (e.g., smoking, heavy drinking, lack of exercise, obesity), and self-assessed health. We find that the expansions increased insurance coverage and access to care among the targeted population of low-income childless adults. The expansions also increased use of certain forms of preventive care, but there is no evidence that they increased ex ante moral hazard (i.e., there is no evidence that risky health behaviors increased in response to health insurance coverage).

We examined the issue of attracting medical students to primary care through the lens of organizational behavior theory. Assuming there are reasons other than lower income potential for why students are inclined against primary care, we applied various principles of the Herzberg 2-factor theory to reimagine the operational flow and design of primary care.

The ACA supports implementation and sustainability of efficient health care models, given expected limits in available resources. This article highlights implementation strategies to build and sustain care coordination, particularly ones consistent with and reinforced by the ACA. It focuses on disease self-management programs to improve the health of patients with type 2 diabetes, exemplified by grantees of the Alliance to Reduce Disparities in Diabetes. Method: We conducted interviews with grantee program representatives throughout their 5-year programs and conducted a qualitative framework analysis of data to identify key themes related to care coordination. Results: The most promising care coordination strategies that grantee programs described included establishing clinic–community collaborations, embedding community health workers within care management teams, and sharing electronic data. Establishing provider buy-in was crucial for these strategies to be effective. Discussion: This article adds new insights into strategies promoting effective care coordination. The strategies that grantees implemented throughout the program align with ACA requirements, underscoring their relevance to the changing U.S. health care environment and the likelihood of further support for program sustainability. © 2016, © 2016 Society for Public Health Education."

Instead of billing patients and insurers service by service, direct primary care doctors charge their patients a periodic, prenegotiated fee in exchange for providing a wide range of healthcare services and increased availability compared to traditional practices. This ""subscription"" model is intended to eliminate the administrative burdens associated with insurer interaction, which, in theory, allows doctors to spend more time with their patients and less time doing paperwork. Direct practices have become increasingly popular since Congress passed the Affordable Care Act (ACA). This growth has been driven by legislation in several states that resolves a number of legal questions that slowed the model's growth and by the ACA's recognition of the model as a permissible way to cover primary care in ""approved"" health plans. Yet legal scholars have hardly focused on direct primary care. Given the model's growth, however, the time is ripe for a more focused legal inquiry. This Note begins that inquiry. After tracing the model's evolution and its core components, this Note substantively examines the laws in states that regulate direct practices and analyzes how those laws address a number of potential policy concerns. It then analyzes direct primary care's broader role in the conmarketplace. Based upon that analysis, this Note concludes that direct primary care is a beneficial innovation that harmonizes well with a cooperative-federalism-based healthcare policy model. © 2017 Glenn E.

However, stigma associated with public insurance coverage may importantly affect the nature and content of the health care beneficiaries receive. In this paper, we examine the health care stigma experiences described by a group of low-income public insurance beneficiaries. They perceive stigma as manifest in poor quality care and negative interpersonal interactions in the health care setting. Using an intersectional approach, we found that the stigma of public insurance was compounded with other sources of stigma including socioeconomic status, race, gender, and illness status. Experiences of stigma had important implications for how subjects evaluated the quality of care, their decisions impacting continuity of care, and their reported ability to access health care. We argue that stigma challenges the quality of care provided under public insurance and is thus a public health issue that should be addressed in Medicaid policy. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York."

Contributing significantly to these disparities are the ability to pay for health care (largely, access to health insurance) and access to, and capacity of, the primary care health workforce. Purpose This article examines key determinants of health (DOH) including demographics, public and regulatory policies, health workforce capacity, and primary health outcomes of four states of the United States. The context of this study is the potential association among health care disparities and myriad DOH, among them, the restrictive nurse practitioner (NP) scope of practice (SOP) regulatory environment, which are documented to influence access to care and health outcomes. Methods This descriptive study explores current NP SOP regulations, access to primary care, and health outcomes of key chronic disease indicators—diabetes, hypertension, and obesity in Alabama, Colorado, Mississippi, and Utah. These states represent both the greatest disparity in chronic disease health outcomes (obesity, diabetes, and hypertension) and the greatest difference in modernization of their NP SOP laws. The Affordable Care Act has greatly expanded access to health care. However, it is estimated that 23 million Americans, 7% of its total population, will remain uninsured by 2019. Discussion Restrictive and inconsistent NP SOP policies may continue to contribute to health workforce capacity and population health disparities across the country, with particular concern for primary care indicators. The study findings bring into question whether states with more restrictive NP SOP regulations impact access to primary care, which may in turn influence population health outcomes. These findings suggest the need for further research. NPs are essential for meeting the increasing demands of primary care in the United States, and quality-of-care indicator research supports their use. © 2016 Elsevier Inc."

We sought to determine whether there was an empirical basis for these concerns. METHODS We used an audit design in which simulated patients called primary care practices seeking new-patient appointments in 10 diverse states (Arkansas, Georgia, Iowa, Illinois, Massachusetts, Montana, New Jersey, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Texas) from November 2012 through April 2013 and from May 2014 through August 2014, before and after the major ACA insurance expansions. Callers were randomly assigned to scripts specifying either private or Medicaid insurance and called only offices identified as “in network” for each plan. RESULTS We completed 5,385 private insurance and 4,352 Medicaid calls in 2012-2013 and 2,424 private insurance and 2,474 Medicaid calls in 2014. Overall appointment rates for private insurance remained stable from 2012 (84.7%) to 2014 (85.8%) with Massachusetts and Pennsylvania experiencing significant increases. Overall, Medicaid appointment rates increased 9.7 percentage points (57.9% to 67.6%) with substantial variation by state. Median wait-times for callers obtaining a new patient appointment remained unchanged at 6 days for privately insured but rose from 6 days to 7 days for Medicaid callers. CONCLUSIONS Contrary to widespread concern, we find no evidence that the millions of individuals newly insured through the ACA decreased new-patient appointment availability across 10 states as shown by stable wait times and appointment rates for private insurance as of mid-2014. © 2017, Annals of Family Medicine, Inc.

Such discussions in the media and among professional organizations may insinuate that changes to the laws governing NP practice will engender acrimony between practicing physicians and NPs. However, we lack empirical, descriptive data on how practicing professionals view NP independence in primary care. Objective: The aim of the present study was to explore and describe the attitudes about NP independence among physicians and NPs working in primary care. Design: A qualitative study based on the principles of grounded theory. Participants: Thirty primary care professionals in Missouri, USA, including 15 primary care physicians and 15 primary care NPs. Approach: Semi-structured, in-depth interviews, with data analysis guided by grounded theory. Key Results: Participants had perspectives that were not well represented by professional organizations or the media. Physicians were supportive of a wide variety of NP roles and comfortable with high levels of NP independence and autonomy. Physicians and NPs described prerequisites to NP independence that were complementary. Physicians generally believed that NPs needed some association with physicians for patient safety, and NPs preferred having a physician readily accessible as needed. The theme “knowing your limits” was important to both NPs and physicians regarding NP independence, and has not been described previously in the literature. Conclusions: NP and physician views about NP practice in primary care are not as divergent as their representative professional organizations and the news media would suggest. The significant agreement among NPs and physicians, and some of the nuances of their perspectives, supports recommendations that may reduce the perceived acrimony surrounding discussions of NP independent practice in primary care. © 2016, Society of General Internal Medicine."

The effects of modern HDHPs on chronically ill patients and adverse outcomes are unknown. OBJECTIVE To determine the association of HDHP with high-priority diabetes outpatient care and preventable acute complications. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Controlled interrupted-time-series study using a large national health insurer database from January 1, 2003, to December 31, 2012. A total of 12 084 HDHP members with diabetes, aged 12 to 64 years, who were enrolled for 1 year in a low-deductible (≤$500) plan followed by 2 years in an HDHP (≥$1000) after an employer-mandated switch were included. Patients transitioning to HDHPs were propensity-score matched with contemporaneous patients whose employers offered only low-deductible coverage. Low-income (n = 4121) and health savings account (HSA)-eligible (n = 1899) patients with diabetes were subgroups of interest. Data analysis was performed from February 23, 2015, to September 11, 2016. EXPOSURES Employer-mandated HDHP transition. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES High-priority outpatient visits, disease monitoring tests, and outpatient and emergency department visits for preventable acute diabetes complications. RESULTS In the 12 084 HDHP members included after the propensity score match, the mean (SD) age was 50.4 (10.0) years; 5410 of the group (44.8%) were women. The overall, low-income, and HSA-eligible diabetes HDHP groups experienced increases in out-of-pocket medical expenditures of 49.4%(95%CI, 40.3%to 58.4%), 51.7%(95%CI, 38.6%to 64.7%), and 67.8%(95%CI, 47.9%to 87.8%), respectively, compared with controls in the year after transitioning to HDHPs. High-priority primary care visits and disease monitoring tests did not change significantly in the overall HDHP cohort; however, high-priority specialist visits declined by 5.5%(95%CI, -9.6%to -1.5%) in follow-up year 1 and 7.1% (95%CI, -11.5%to -2.7%) in follow-up year 2 vs baseline. Outpatient acute diabetes complication visits were delayed in the overall and low-income HDHP cohorts at follow-up (adjusted hazard ratios, 0.94 [95%CI, 0.88 to 0.99] for the overall cohort and 0.89 [95%CI, 0.81 to 0.98] for the low-income cohort). Annual emergency department acute complication visits among HDHP members increased by 8.0% (95%CI, 4.6%to 11.4%) in the overall group, 21.7%(95%CI, 14.5%to 28.9%) in the low-income group, and 15.5%(95%CI, 10.5%to 20.6%) in the HSA-eligible group. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Patients with diabetes experienced minimal changes in outpatient visits and disease monitoring after an HDHP switch, but low-income and HSA-eligible HDHP members experienced major increases in emergency department visits for preventable acute diabetes complications."

However, little is known about their effect on specific health outcomes. Objective: To evaluate the association between prescription drug copayments and uncontrolled hypertension, uncontrolled hypercholesterolemia, and prescription drug utilization among Medicaid beneficiaries with these conditions. Subjects: Select adults aged 20-64 from NHANES 1999-2012 in 18 states. Measures: Uncontrolled hypertension, uncontrolled hypercholesterolemia, and taking medication for each of these conditions. Research Design: A differencing regression model was used to evaluate health outcomes among Medicaid beneficiaries in 4 states that introduced copayments during the study period, relative to 2 comparison groups - Medicaid beneficiaries in 14 states unaffected by shifts in copayment policy, and a within-state counterfactual group of low-income adults not on Medicaid, while controlling for individual demographic factors and unobserved state-level characteristics. Results: Although uncontrolled hypertension and hypercholesterolemia declined among all low-income persons during the study period, the trend was less pronounced in Medicaid beneficiaries affected by copayments. After netting out concurrent trends in health outcomes of low-income persons unaffected by Medicaid copayment changes, we estimated that introduction of drug copayments in Medicaid was associated with an average rise in uncontrolled hypertension and uncontrolled hypercholesterolemia of 7.7 and 13.2 percentage points, respectively, and with reduced drug utilization for hypercholesterolemia. Conclusions: As Medicaid programs change in the years following the Affordable Care Act, prescription drug copayments may play a role as a lever for controlling hypertension and hypercholesterolemia at the population level. © Copyright 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Although the majority of HC care is provided by primary care physicians (PCMDs), a growing proportion is delivered by nurse practitioners (NPs) and physician assistants (PAs); yet, little is known about how these clinicians’ care compares in this setting. OBJECTIVES:: To compare the quality of care and practice patterns of NPs, PAs, and PCMDs in HCs. RESEARCH DESIGN:: Using 5 years of data (2006–2010) from the HC subsample of the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and multivariate regression analysis, we estimated the impact of receiving NP-delivered or PA-delivered care versus PCMD-delivered care. We used design-based and model-based inference and weighted all estimates. SUBJECTS:: Primary analyses included 23,704 patient visits to 1139 practitioners—a sample representing approximately 30 million patient visits to HCs in the United States. MEASURES:: We examined 9 patient-level outcomes: 3 quality indicators, 4 service utilization measures, and 2 referral pattern measures. RESULTS:: On 7 of the 9 outcomes studied, no statistically significant differences were detected in NP or PA care compared with PCMD care. On the remaining outcomes, visits to NPs were more likely to receive recommended smoking cessation counseling and more health education/counseling services than visits to PCMDs (P≤0.05). Visits to PAs also received more health education/counseling services than visits to PCMDs (P≤0.01; design-based model only).

Questions/Purposes: (1) Do orthopaedic practices provide varying access to orthopaedic care for simulated patients with Medicaid insurance versus private insurance in a blinded survey? (2) What are the surveyed state-by-state Medicaid acceptance rates for adult orthopaedic practices in the current era of Medicaid expansion set forth by the PPACA? (3) Do surveyed rates of access to orthopaedic care in the adult patient population vary across practice setting (private vs academic) or vary with different Medicaid physician reimbursement rates? (4) Are there differences in the surveyed Medicaid acceptance rates for adult orthopaedic practices in states that have expanded Medicaid coverage versus states that have foregone expansion? Methods: Simulated Patient Survey: We performed a telephone survey study of orthopaedic offices in four states with Medicaid expansion. In the survey, the caller assumed a fictitious identity as a 38-year-old male who experienced an ankle fracture 1 day before calling, and attempted to secure an appointment within 2 weeks. During initial contact, the fictitious patient reported Medicaid insurance status. One month later, the fictitious patient contacted the same orthopaedic practice and reported private insurance coverage status. National Orthopaedic Survey: Private and academic orthopaedic practices operating in each state in the United States were called and asked to complete a survey assessing their practice model of Medicaid insurance acceptance. State reimbursement rates for three different Current Procedural Terminology (CPT®) codes were collected from state Medicaid agencies. Results Simulated Patient Survey: Offices were less likely to accept Medicaid than commercial insurance (30 of 64 [47%] versus 62 of 64 [97%]; odds ratio [OR], 0.0145; 95% CI, 0.00088–0.23639; p &lt; 0.001), and patients with Medicaid were less likely to be offered an appointment within 2 weeks (23 of 64 [36%] versus 59 of 64 [89%]; OR, 0.0154; 95% CI, 0.00094– 0.251; p &lt; 0.001). The Medicaid acceptance rates observed across states sampled in the simulated patient survey were 67% (Pennsylvania), 21% (New Jersey), 58% (Delaware), and 50% (Maryland) (p = 0.04). National Orthopaedic Survey: Adult patients with Medicaid insurance had limited access to care in 109 of 342 (32%) orthopaedic practices: 37% of private and 13% of academic practices (p &lt; 0.001). Practices that accepted Medicaid received higher reimbursement for each CPT® code relative to those that did not and acceptance of Medicaid became increasingly more likely as reimbursement rates increased (99243: OR, 1.03, 95% CI, 1.02–1.04 per dollar, p &lt; 0.001; 99213: OR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.03–1.07 per dollar, p &lt; 0.001; 28876: OR, 1.01, 95% CI, 1.00–1.01 per dollar, p &lt; 0.001). For a given reimbursement rate, private practices were less likely to take an adult patient with Medicaid relative to an academic practice (99243: OR, 0.11, 95% CI, 0.04–0.33, p &lt; 0.001; 99213: OR, 0.11, 95% CI, 0.04–0.32, p &lt; 0.001; 27786: OR, 0.12, 95% CI, 0.04–0.35, p &lt; 0.001). No difference was observed when comparing Medicaid acceptance rates for all practice types between states that have expanded their Medicaid program versus those that have not (OR, 1.02; 95% CI 0.62–1.70; p = 0.934). Conclusions: In this two-part survey study, we found that a simulated patient with commercial insurance was more likely to have their insurance accepted and to gain timely access to orthopaedic care than a patient with Medicaid. Academic practice setting and increased Medicaid reimbursement rates were associated with increased access to care for the patient with Medicaid. Inequality in access to orthopaedic care based on health insurance status likely exists for the adult patient with Medicaid. Furthermore, Medicaid expansion has likely realized minimal gains in access to care for the adult orthopaedic patient. Further research is needed in delineating the patient-payer selection criteria used by orthopaedic practices to aid policymakers in reforming the Medicaid program and comprehensibly addressing this access to care disparity.

To characterize the scope and potential impact of this problem, we assessed rates of inclusion of Commission on Cancer (CoC) -accredited hospitals and National Cancer Institute (NCI) -designated cancer centers within federal exchange networks. Methods: We downloaded publicly available machine-readable network data and public use files for individual federal exchange plans from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for the 2016 enrollment year. We linked this information to National Provider Identifier data, identified a set of distinct provider networks, and assessed the rates of inclusion of CoC-accredited hospitals and NCI-designated centers. We measured variation in these rates according to geography, plan type, and metal level. Results: Of 4,058 unique individual plans, network data were available for 3,637 (90%); hospital information was available for 3,531 (87%). Provider lists for these plans reduced into 295 unique networks for analysis. Ninety-five percent of networks included at least one CoC-accredited hospital, but just 41% of networks included NCI-designated centers. States and counties each varied substantially in the proportion of networks listed that included NCI-designated centers (range, 0% to 100%). The proportion of networks that included NCI-designated centers also varied by plan type (range, 31% for health maintenance organizations to 49% for preferred provider organizations; P = .04) but not by metal level. Conclusion: A large majority of federal exchange networks contain CoC-accredited hospitals, but most do not contain NCI-designated cancer centers.

In contrast, Medicaid enrollees use the ED more than other groups, including the uninsured. Thus, the expected impact of Medicaid expansion on ED use is unclear. OBJECTIVES:: To estimate changes in total and NE ED visits as a result of California’s early Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act. In addition to overall changes in the number of visits, changes by payer and safety net hospital status are examined. METHODS:: We used a quasi-experimental approach to examine changes in ED utilization, comparing California expansion counties to comparison counties from California and 2 other states in the same region that did not implement Medicaid expansion during the study period. RESULTS:: Regression estimates show no significant change in total number of ED visits following expansion. Medicaid visits increased by 145 visits per hospital-quarter in the first year following expansion and 242 visits subsequent to the first year, whereas visits among uninsured patients decreased by 129 visits per hospital-quarter in the first year and 175 visits in subsequent years, driven by changes at safety net hospitals. We also observe an increase in NE visits per hospital-quarter paid for by Medicaid, and a significant decrease in uninsured NE visits. CONCLUSIONS:: Medicaid expansions in California were associated with increases in ED visits paid for by Medicaid and declines in uninsured visits. Expansion was also associated with changes in NE visits among Medicaid enrollees and the uninsured. Copyright © 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved."

Critical to implementation of broad service delivery reforms has been the preparation of organizations responsible for service delivery. This study focused on one large-scale initiative to overhaul its service system with the goal of improving service quality and reducing costs. The study examined the participation of behavioral health organizations in technical assistance efforts and the extent to which organizational factors related to their participation. Methods: This study matched two datasets to examine the organizational characteristics and training participation for 196 behavioral health organizations. Organizational characteristics were drawn from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration National Mental Health Services Survey (N-MHSS). Training variables were drawn from the Clinical Technical Assistance Center's master training database. Chi-square analyses and multivariate logistic regression models were used to examine the proportion of organizations that participated in training, the organizational characteristics (size, population served, service quality, infrastructure) that predicted participation in training, and for those who participated, the type (clinical or business) and intensity of training (webinar, learning collaborative, in-person) they received. Results: Overall 142 (72. 4%) of the sample participated in training. Organizations who pursued training were more likely to be large in size (p = .02), serve children in addition to adults (p < .01), provide child evidence-based practices (p = .01), and use computerized scheduling (p = .01). Of those trained, 95% participated in webinars, 64% participated in learning collaboratives and 35% participated in in-person trainings. More organizations participated in business trainings than clinical (63.8 vs. 59.2%). Organizations serving children had higher odds of participating in both clinical training (OR = 5.91, p < .01) and business training (OR = 4.24, p < .01) than those that did not serve children. Conclusions: The majority of organizations participated in trainings indicating desire for technical assistance to prepare for health care reform. Larger organizations and organizations serving children were more likely to participate potentially indicating increased interest in preparation. Over half participated in business trainings highlighting interest in learning to improve efficiency. Further understanding is needed to support organizational readiness for health care reform initiatives among behavioral health organizations. © 2017 The Author(s)."

The ACA called for every state to expand Medicaid coverage by 2014. In a 2012 legal challenge, the US Supreme Court ruled that states were not required to implement Medicaid expansions. This 'natural experiment' presents a unique opportunity to learn whether and to what extent Medicaid expansion can affect healthcare access and services for patients with DM risk, pre-DM, or DM. Methods/design: Data from electronic health records (EHRs) from the Accelerating Data Value Across a National Community Health Center Network (ADVANCE) clinical data research network, which has data from >700 community health centers (CHCs), was included in the study. EHR data will be linked to Oregon Medicaid claims data. Data collection will include information on changes in health insurance, service receipt, and health outcomes, spanning 9 years (pre- and post-expansion), comparing states that expanded Medicaid, and those that did not. Patients included in this study will be diagnosed with DM, be at risk for DM, or have pre-DM, between the ages of 19 and 64, with ≥1 ambulatory visit. Sample size is estimated to be roughly 275,000 patients. Biostatistical analyses will include the difference-in-differences (DID) methodology and a generalized linear mixed model. Econometric analyses will include a DID two-part method to calculate the difference in Medicaid expenditures in Oregon among newly insured CHC patients. Discussion: Findings will have national relevance on DM health services and outcomes and will be shared through national conferences and publications. The findings will provide information needed to impact the policy as it is related to access to health insurance and receipt of healthcare among a vulnerable population.

The potential for integration to improve quality while managing costs for individuals with high needs, coupled with the remaining financial, operational, and policy challenges, underscores a need for continued discussion of integration programs' preliminary outcomes and lessons. The authors describe the early efforts of the HealthChoices HealthConnections pilot program for adult Medicaid beneficiaries with serious mental illness and co-occurring chronic conditions, which used a navigator model in 3 southeastern Pennsylvania counties. Method: The authors conducted a difference-in-differences analysis of emergency department (ED) visits, hospitalizations, and readmissions using Medicaid claims data and collected data about program implementation. Results: ED visits decreased 4% among study group members (n = 4,788) while increasing almost 6% in the comparison group (n = 7,039) during the intervention period (p = .036); there were no statistically significant differences in hospitalizations or readmissions. This pilot demonstrated the promise of nurse navigators (care managers) to bridge gaps between the physical and mental health care systems, and the success of a private-public partnership developing a member profile to share behavioral and physical health information in the absence of an interoperable health information technology system. Conclusions and Implications for Practice: The implementation lessons can inform state Medicaid Health Home models as well as accountable care organizations considering incorporation of behavioral health care.

We evaluated insurance coverage and barriers to insurance use among patients presenting for services at the Rhode Island sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinic. METHODS: We analyzed factors associated with insurance coverage and utilization among patients presenting for STD services between July and December 2015. RESULTS: A total of 692 patients had insurance information available; of those, 40% were uninsured. Patients without insurance were more likely than those with insurance to be nonwhite (50% among uninsured, compared with 40% among insured; P = 0.014) and Hispanic or Latino/a (25%, compared with 16%; P = 0.006), and less likely to be men who have sex with men (27%, compared with 39%; P = 0.001). Of those with health insurance, 26% obtained coverage as a result of the Affordable Care Act, and 56% of those were previously uninsured. Among uninsured individuals, barriers to obtaining health insurance included cost and unemployment. Among those with insurance, 43% reported willingness to use insurance for STD services. Barriers to insurance use included concerns about anonymity and out-of-pocket costs. CONCLUSIONS: Despite expanded insurance access, many individuals presenting to the Rhode Island STD Clinic were uninsured. Among those who were insured, significant barriers still existed to using insurance. STD clinics continue to play an important role in providing safety-net STD services in states with low uninsured rates.

Cost estimators are one such tool. They are designed to provide consumers a personalized estimate of the total cost--premium, minus subsidy, plus cost-sharing--of their coverage options. Cost estimators were available in most states by the start of the fourth open enrollment period. Goal: To understand the experiences of marketplaces that offer a total cost estimator and the interests and concerns of policymakers from states that are not using them. Methods: Structured interviews with marketplace officials, consumer enrollment assisters, technology vendors, and subject matter experts; analysis of the total cost estimators available on the marketplaces as of October 2016. Key findings and conclusions: Informants strongly supported marketplace adoption of a total cost estimator. Marketplaces that offer an estimator faced a range of design choices and varied significantly in their approaches to resolving them. Interviews suggested a clear need for additional consumer testing and data analysis of tool usage and for sustained outreach to enrollment assisters to encourage greater use of the estimators."

Pharmacoeconomic analyses offer one method of demonstrating a product’s value, yet there is a lack of resources specific to US drug costs relevant to each stakeholder. The aim of this study was to review current US drug costs (post-ACA). A literature review aimed at finding evidence on outpatient prescription drug costs was performed using the following sources: PubMed, governmental agencies, news websites, the Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy (AMCP) website, and Google Scholar. Articles were limited to those published in the years “2010–2016” and the “English” language, and those that described drug acquisition costs, reimbursement costs, and rebates or discounting for Medicare, Medicaid, and commercial payors. The Drug Cost Focus Group (DCFG) was convened to supplement the literature review; the DCFG provided their expertise on US drug costs and emerging issues affecting drug costs. ACA legislation increased drug rebates for manufacturers participating in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. Acquisition costs commonly referred to in the literature include the wholesale acquisition cost and average manufacture price. Drugs reimbursed by Medicaid are currently based on the actual acquisition cost and ACA-Federal Upper Limit. Evidence suggests that reimbursement methods in the public market are varied.

Using multilevel regression analyses of county-level non-elderly adult small area health insurance estimates (N = 3135) from the US Census Bureau, several important findings emerge. Compared to counties located in states that did not expand Medicaid, counties located in states that did expand experienced significantly larger increases in adult health insurance coverage rates between 2013 and 2014, net of the county baseline insurance coverage rate, socioeconomic and demographic composition, and labor market characteristics. In states that did not expand Medicaid, counties with larger shares of vulnerable residents (i.e., poor adults and low education) experienced lagging improvements in health insurance coverage. However, counties in states that expanded Medicaid were protected from several of these exacerbated disparities, and in some cases, experienced larger insurance coverage improvements than counties with less disadvantaged populations. These findings suggest that although insurance coverage increased in nearly all counties between 2013 and 2014, increases would have been larger and disparities would have been further alleviated if more states with highly concentrated vulnerable populations had expanded Medicaid. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht."

Background Underinsurance limits access to transplants, especially among racial/ethnic minorities. Changes in racial/ethnic listing rates post-ACA Medicaid Expansion are unknown. Methods Using the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients, we analyzed 5,651 patients from early adopter states (implemented the ACA Medicaid Expansion by January 2014) and 4,769 patients from non-adopter states (no implementation during the study period) from 2012 to 2015. Piecewise linear models, stratified according to race/ethnicity, were fit to monthly census-adjusted rates of heart transplant listings before and after January 2014. Results A significant 30% increase in the rate of heart transplant listings for African-American patients in early adopter states occurred immediately after the ACA Medicaid Expansion on January 1, 2014 (before 0.15 to after 0.20/100,000; increase 0.05/100,000; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.01 to 0.08); in contrast, the rates for African-American patients in non-adopter states remained constant (before and after 0.15/100,000; increase 0.006/100,000; 95% CI: –0.03 to 0.04). Hispanic patients experienced an opposite trend, with no significant change in early adopter states (before 0.03 to after 0.04/100,000; increase 0.01/100,000; 95% CI: –0.004 to 0.02) and a significant increase in non-adopter states (before 0.03 to after 0.05/100,000; increase 0.02/100,000; 95% CI: 0.002 to 0.03). There were no significant changes in listing rates among Caucasian patients in either early adopter states or non-adopter states. Conclusions Implementation of the ACA Medicaid Expansion was associated with increased heart transplant listings in African-American patients but not in Hispanic or Caucasian patients.

Methods Using statewide hospital administrative data from 2011 through 2015 from 201 nonfederal Illinois hospitals for patients aged 18 to 64 years, mean monthly ED visits were compared before and after ACA implementation by disposition from the ED and primary payer. Visit data were combined with 2010 to 2014 census insurance estimates to compute payer-specific ED visit rates. Interrupted time-series analyses tested changes in ED visit rates and ED hospitalization rates by insurance type after ACA implementation. Results Average monthly ED visit volume increased by 14,080 visits (95% confidence interval [CI] 4,670 to 23,489), a 5.7% increase, after ACA implementation. Changes by payer were as follows: uninsured decreased by 24,158 (95% CI −27,037 to −21,279), Medicaid increased by 28,746 (95% CI 23,945 to 33,546), and private insurance increased by 9,966 (95% 6,241 to 13,690). The total monthly ED visit rate increased by 1.8 visits per 1,000 residents (95% CI 0.6 to 3.0). The monthly ED visit rate decreased by 8.7 visit per 1,000 uninsured residents (95% CI −11.1 to −6.3) and increased by 10.2 visit per 1,000 Medicaid beneficiaries (95% CI 4.4 to 16.1) and 1.3 visits per 1,000 privately insured residents (95% CI 0.6 to 1.9). After adjusting for baseline trends and season, these changes remained statistically significant. The total number of hospitalizations through the ED was unchanged. Conclusion ED visits by adults aged 18 to 64 years in Illinois increased after ACA health insurance expansion. The increase in total ED visits was driven by an increase in visits resulting in discharge from the ED. A large post-ACA increase in Medicaid visits and a modest increase in privately insured visits outpaced a large reduction in ED visits by uninsured patients. These changes are larger than can be explained by population changes alone and are significantly different from trends in ED use before ACA implementation. © 2016 American College of Emergency Physicians"

The Affordable Care Act (ACA) sought to change this state of affairs, establishing a new Patient’s Bill of Rights and instituting other protections that require insurers to make comprehensive coverage readily accessible. However, recent reports have begun to document health plans’ violations of the ACA, such as their failure to pay consumers their required refunds or the illegal imposition of waiting periods for transplant services. Although the ACA preserves a role for states in implementing and enforcing the law, state remedies are often lacking. For instance, many state consumer protection laws do not apply to insurance, while traditional breach of contract claims only provide for recourse when a health insurance policy expressly incorporates ACA provisions. As a result, a critical gap in the law has come to light: the absence of a private right of action. This Note proposes that state courts can address this gap by finding that the sale of individual health insurance comes with an implicit and legally enforceable promise that the policy and insurer administering it are in full compliance with the ACA. In other words, this Note urges courts to establish an ""implied warranty of legality"" in the context of individual health insurance. Modeled on the implied warranty of habitability, this approach would correct for power imbalances within this market. It would also promote individual rights by empowering consumers to sue when they have been wronged and foster civic engagement by enabling consumers to play an active role in the enforcement of public law. The implied warranty of legality would also have redistributive effects, allowing for the costs of noncompliance to be shared more evenly across the market. Looking beyond the ACA, the implied warranty of legality should also be applied in other regulated markets with similar dynamics, or, if the ACA is scaled back or repealed, to enforce state health insurance rules that seek to protect consumers from unlawful insurer practices. © 2017, Yale Law Journal.

Study Setting: Large MA health maintenance organization offering individual-subscriber MA insurance and employer-supplemented group MA insurance. Study Design: We investigated the impact on breast cancer screening of a policy that eliminated a $20 copayment for screening mammography in 2010 among 53,188 women continuously enrolled from 2007 to 2012 in an individual-subscriber MA plan, compared with 42,473 women with employer-supplemented group MA insurance in the same health maintenance organization who had full screening coverage during this period. We used differences-in-differences analysis to study the impact of cost-sharing elimination on mammography rates. Principal Findings: Annual screening rates declined over time for both groups, with similar trends pre-2010 and a slower decline after 2010 among women whose copayments were eliminated. Among women aged 65–74 years in the individual-subscriber MA plan, 44.9 percent received screening in 2009 compared with 40.9 percent in 2012, while 49.5 percent of women in the employer-supplemented MA plan received screening in 2009 compared with 44.1 percent in 2012, that is, a difference-in-difference effect of 1.4 percentage points less decline in screening among women experiencing the cost-sharing elimination. Effects were concentrated among women without recent screening. There were no differences by neighborhood socioeconomic status or race/ethnicity. Conclusions: Eliminating cost sharing for screening mammography was associated with modesty lower decline in screening rates among women with previously low screening adherence. © Health Research and Educational Trust"

Outreach eff orts that only track contacts, such as appointments and email addresses, lack information needed to assess enrollment. Linking outreach activities to enrollment outcomes leads us to a dramatically diff erent conclusion about using big data and campaign-style tactics than evaluations of similar techniques such as that pioneered by Enroll America in 11 states.

Patient safety indicators (PSI) are a means to measure the incidence of these adverse events. When adverse events occur, reimbursement to the hospital decreases. The incidence of adverse quality events among patients hospitalized for primary spinal neoplasms is unknown. Similarly, it is unclear what the impact of insurance status is on adverse care quality among this patient population. Purpose We aimed to determine the incidence of PSI among patients admitted with primary spinal neoplasms, and to determine the association between insurance status and the incidence of PSI in this population. Study Design This is a retrospective cohort study. Patient Sample We included all patients, 18 years and older, in the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) who were hospitalized for primary spine neoplasms from 1998 to 2011. Outcome Measures Incidence of PSI from 1998 to 2011 served as outcome variable. Methods The NIS was queried for all hospitalizations with a diagnosis of primary spinal neoplasm during the inpatient episode from 1998 to 2011. Incidence of PSI was determined using publicly available lists of International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) diagnosis codes. Logistic regression models were used to determine the effect of primary payer status on PSI incidence. All comparisons were made between privately insured patients and Medicaid or self-pay patients. Results We identified 6,095 hospitalizations in which a primary spinal neoplasm was recorded during the inpatient episode. We excluded patients younger than 18 years and those with “other” or “missing” primary insurance status, leaving 5,880 patients for analysis. After adjusting for patient demographics and hospital characteristics, Medicaid or self-pay patients had significantly greater odds of experiencing one or more PSI (odds ratio [OR] 1.81 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.11–2.95) relative to privately insured patients. Conclusions Among patients hospitalized for primary spinal neoplasms, primary payer status predicts the incidence of PSI, an indicator of adverse health-care quality used to determine hospital reimbursement by the CMS. As reimbursement continues to be intertwined with reportable quality metrics, identifying vulnerable populations is critical to improving patient care. © 2016 Elsevier Inc."

Our objective was to determine the relationship between insurance status and disease complexity at presentation among a national sample of emergency general surgical patients. Methods Data from the National Emergency Department Sample from 2006–2009 were queried to identify all patients aged 18–64 years old admitted through the emergency department with a primary diagnosis of appendicitis, diverticulitis, inguinal hernia, or bowel obstruction. Primary outcome of complex presentation was defined as also presenting with generalized peritonitis, intra-abdominal abscess, perforated bowel, intestinal gangrene, or other disease-specific measures of complexity. We used multivariable logistic regression to determine the independent association between insurance status and complex presentation. Models accounted for patient- and hospital-level covariates. Counterfactual models were used to estimate the risk of complex presentation attributable to lack of insurance. Results A total of 1,373,659 patients were included, with an overall uninsured rate of 12.3%. Uninsured patients had significantly higher, unadjusted rates of complex presentation, and uninsured payer status was independently associated with complex presentation (odds ratio 1.38, 95% confidence interval: 1.34–1.42). Counterfactual models suggest that having insurance would result in a 22.37% (95% confidence interval: 22.35–22.39%) relative decline in risk of complex emergency general surgical presentation among the uninsured population. Conclusion Insurance status is independently associated with severity of disease at presentation among emergency general surgical conditions nationally. In light of recently reaffirmed Affordable Care Act insurance expansion provisions, these results anticipate increased timely access to operative care for newly insured patients and a corresponding decline in complex, emergency general surgical presentations. © 2016 Elsevier Inc."

Employer-sponsored wellness programs with incentives based on biometric outcomes are allowed and often used despite mixed evidence regarding their effectiveness. This study examines consumers' perceptions of their coverage for obesity treatments and exposure to workplace wellness programs. Methods: A total of 7,378 participants completed an online survey during 2015–2016. Respondents answered questions regarding their health coverage for seven medical services and exposure to employer wellness programs that target weight or body mass index (BMI). Using χ2 tests, associations between perceptions of exposure to employer wellness programs and coverage for medical services were examined. Differences between survey years were also assessed. Results: Most respondents reported they did not have health coverage for obesity treatments, but more of the respondents with employer wellness programs reported having coverage. Neither the perception of coverage for obesity treatments nor exposure to wellness programs increased between 2015 and 2016. Conclusions: Even when consumers have exposure to employer wellness programs that target BMI, their health insurance often excludes obesity treatments.

Methods: We used the linked National Health Interview Survey (survey years 1995, 1997-2005) and the Medicaid Analytic eXtract files (1999-2008) to assess utilization of smoking cessation medication benefits among 5,982 cigarette smokers aged 18-64 years enrolled in Medicaid fee-for-service whose state Medicaid insurance covered at least one cessation medication. We excluded visits during pregnancy, and those covered by managed care or under dual enrollment (Medicaid and Medicare). Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine correlates of cessation medication benefit utilization among Medicaid fee-for-service enrollees, including measures of drug coverage (comprehensive cessation medication coverage, number of medications in state benefit, varenicline coverage), individual-level demographics at NHIS interview, age at Medicaid enrollment, and state-level cigarette excise taxes, statewide smoke-free laws, and per-capita tobacco control funding. Results: In 1999, the percent of smokers with ≥1 medication claims was 5.7% in the 30 states that covered at least one Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved cessation medication; this increased to 9.9% in 2008 in the 44 states that covered at least one FDA-approved medication (p<0.01). Cessation medication utilization was greater among older individuals (Ge; 25 years), females, non-Hispanic whites, and those with higher educational attainment. Comprehensive coverage, the number of smoking cessation medications covered and varenicline coverage were all positively associated with utilization; cigarette excise tax and percapita tobacco control funding were also positively associated with utilization. Conclusions: Utilization of medication benefits among fee-for-service Medicaid enrollees increased from 1999-2008 and varied by individual and state-level characteristics. Given that the Affordable Care Act bars state Medicaid programs from excluding any FDA-approved cessation medications from coverage as of January 2014, monitoring Medicaid cessation medication claims may be beneficial for informing efforts to increase utilization and maximize smoking cessation."

Although tailoring of treatment to individual patient needs is an important goal, the recent passage of the Affordable Care Act has placed renewed interest in cost containment and cost-effectiveness. We sought to conduct a literature review of recent US-based studies to analyze the cost-effectiveness of initial local treatments for localized prostate cancer. Methods We conducted a systematic literature search through PubMed, the Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Registry, and manual cross-referencing of articles. We identified US-based studies with cost analyses starting in 2005 that studied the cost-effectiveness of initial local treatments for localized prostate cancer (surgery, radiation, or observation). Results There were eight studies that met our inclusion and exclusion criteria. Most studies took the cost perspective of Medicare, and two studies also considered the societal cost in terms of lost patient time. Most studies also used a Markov model with inputs based on the available literature for the effectiveness and toxicity of the different treatment options. The radiation-focused studies tended to find brachytherapy (BT) or stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) to be more cost-effective than intensity-modulated radiation therapy or proton beam therapy. These findings were primarily based on the lower cost of SBRT or BT with roughly equal efficacy and toxicity. The two studies focused on surgery found surgery to be more cost effective than intensity-modulated radiation therapy, at least for low-risk disease, and one study found BT to be more cost-effective than surgery, and watchful waiting to be the most cost-effective option overall. Conclusion Cost-effectiveness analysis is important because it helps patients, physicians, and policymakers make quantitatively-based decisions, which balance treatment efficacy, toxicity, and costs. Significant methodological heterogeneity in the studies we found limit the ability to compare their results directly, but most found that for favorable-risk prostate cancer, shorter or simpler treatments tended to be more cost-effective, including no treatment (watchful waiting) in one study. © 2017 Elsevier Inc."

Therefore, using the Short Form-6D (SF-6D) utility values, the purpose of this study was to determine (1) the quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained and (2) and the cost-effectiveness of undergoing THA and TKA. Methods A total of 844 patients (357 men, 487 women) who had a mean age of 65 years (range, 39 to 80 years) underwent primary TKA, and 224 patients who had a mean age of 69 years (range, 44 to 88 years) underwent primary THAs at 7 institutions. The SF-6D values were derived for each patient preoperatively and at 1-year follow-up. QALYs were estimated at 1 year, and lifetime QALYs gained were determined using predicted life-expectancy values, at a discounted rate of 3% per year of life expectancy, to reflect a diminishing gain with time. National-level costs were determined using the 2011 Nationwide Inpatient Sample, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) were deduced for both groups. Results The preoperative SF-6D values for the THA and TKA cohorts were 0.614 (range, 0.37 to 1) and 0.62 (range, 0.3 to 0.93). Postoperatively, SF-6D values improved significantly at 1 year in both groups. One-year QALYs for TKA and THA were 0.768 and 0.799. Lifetime QALYs gained for the groups were 2.07 and 1.85 (1.39 and 1.34 if discounted at a rate of 3% per year). The estimated ICER for TKA vs baseline presurgery was $43,107 per QALY, and $39,453 per QALY for THA vs baseline presurgery. Conclusion The ICER showed that THA and TKA are cost-effective, compared to the $50,000 USD/QALY threshold for cost-effectiveness, and justify resources allocated to these surgeries. The SF-6D can utilize existing functional outcome data, which makes these cost calculations considerably easier and more feasible for practicing orthopedists. © 2016 Elsevier Inc."

This brief report describes and discusses an inquiry of promising strategies for improving access and preventive care delivery identified in selected high-performing states. Methods Two data sources were used to identify top-performing states in insurance enrollment and preventive care delivery: National Survey of Children’s Health for adolescents (ages 12–17 years) and Behavioral Risk Factors Surveillance System for young adults (ages 18–25 years). Interviews were conducted with key stakeholders to identify promising strategies related to increasing AYAs’ insurance enrollment and receipt of preventive services. Results Seven top-performing states were selected: California, Colorado, Illinois, Iowa, Oregon, Vermont, and Texas; 27 stakeholders completed interviews. Four strategies were identified regarding insurance enrollment: use of partnerships; special populations outreach; leveraging laws and resources; and youth engagement. Four strategies were identified regarding quality preventive care: expand provider capacity to serve AYAs; adopt medical home policies; establish quality improvement projects; and enhance consumer awareness of well-visit. States focused more on adolescents than young adults and on increasing health insurance enrollment than the provision of preventive services.

This study explored the frequency with which hospital-based physicians at academic medical centers are not included in the network directories for the same insurance networks as their parent teaching hospitals. Methods: We studied teaching hospitals with residency programs in all four hospital-based specialties. Using insurance plan provider directories, we determined whether each teaching hospital was in-network for randomly selected locally available insurance plans offered through the federal and state marketplace exchanges. For each established hospital-network relationship, we then determined whether hospital-based specialists were included in the provider network directory by searching for the name of each specialty's residency program director and the name of the physician practice group. Results: We identified 79 teaching hospitals participating in 144 locally available insurance plan networks. Hospital-based specialist inclusion in these hospital-network relationships was: emergency physicians: 50.0% (CI: 40%-59%); anesthesiologists: 50.0% (CI: 42%-58%); pathologists: 45.4% (CI: 37%-54%); and radiologists: 55.1% (46%-64%). Inclusion of all four hospital-based specialties occurred in only 45.0% (CI: 36%-54%) of the hospital-network relationships. Conclusion: For insurance plans offered through the federal and state marketplace exchanges, hospital-based specialists frequently are not included in the directories for the insurance networks in which their parent teaching hospitals participate.

Currently, various primary data collection methods exist that meet the ACA and PHAB requirements. OBJECTIVE:: To compare 2 CHNA data collection methods implemented in the same geographical area from a local health department perspective. DESIGN AND SETTING:: Two community surveys, one door-to-door and one telephone, in the 76706 zip code area of McLennan County, Texas. PARTICIPANTS:: Adult survey respondents (Community Assessment for Public Health Emergency Response [CASPER]: N = 184; random digit dialing [RDD]: N = 133) of the 76706 zip code in McLennan County, Texas. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:: Survey response rates, sociodemographic characteristics of survey respondents, and self-reported health behaviors from both community survey types. RESULTS:: The CASPER survey had a contact rate of 36.0% and a cooperation rate of 60.5%, compared with a 10.1% response rate for the RDD survey. CASPER respondents were younger (26.6% aged 18-24 years), had lower education attainment (17.4% less than high school), and had a higher proportion of Hispanics (24.5%) than RDD respondents (4.6%, 10.5%, and 17.3%, respectively). CASPER respondents were less likely to report being overweight or obese (56.5%), to report days where no fruit or vegetables were consumed (7.1%), and to report days where no walking activity was conducted (9.8%) than RDD respondents (70.2%, 27.8%, and 21.8%, respectively). The CASPER survey cost less to conduct ($13 500) than the RDD survey ($100 000) and was logistically easier for the local health department to conduct using internally available resources. IMPLICATIONS:: Local health departments use various data collection methods to conduct CHNAs for their populations and require varying levels of commitment and resources. RDD and CASPER can be used to meet ACA and PHAB requirements, collecting valuable health needs estimates and offer various strengths and weaknesses. CONCLUSION:: PHAB and ACA requirements can be met using the CASPER or RDD survey to conduct CHNAs. However, local health departments may consider the CASPER survey a viable alternative to the RDD survey when time and resources are limited. The CASPER survey offers flexibility and efficiency and requires limited equipment and training. Copyright © 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved."

Our objectives were to assess among general internists (GIM) and family physicians (FP) shortly after Affordable Care Act (ACA) implementation: (1) proportion of adult patients deferring or refusing vaccines because of cost and frequency of physicians not recommending vaccines for financial reasons; (2) satisfaction with reimbursement for vaccine purchase and administration by payer type; (3) knowledge of Medicare coverage of vaccines; and (4) awareness of vaccine-specific provisions of the ACA. Methods We administered an Internet and mail survey from June to October 2013 to national networks of 438 GIMs and 401 FPs. Results Response rates were 72% (317/438) for GIM and 59% (236/401) for FP. Among physicians who routinely recommended vaccines, up to 24% of GIM and 30% of FP reported adult patients defer or refuse certain vaccines for financial reasons most of the time. Physicians reported not recommending vaccines because they thought the patient's insurance would not cover it (35%) or the patient could be vaccinated more affordably elsewhere (38%). Among physicians who saw patients with this insurance, dissatisfaction (‘very dissatisfied’) was highest for payments received from Medicaid (16% vaccine purchase, 14% vaccine administration) and Medicare Part B (11% vaccine purchase, 11% vaccine administration). Depending on the vaccine, 36–71% reported not knowing how Medicare covered the vaccine. Thirty-seven percent were ‘not at all aware’ and 19% were ‘a little aware’ of vaccine-specific provisions of the ACA. Conclusions Patients are refusing and physicians are not recommending adult vaccinations for financial reasons. Increased knowledge of private and public insurance coverage for adult vaccinations might position physicians to be more likely to recommend vaccines and better enable them to refer patients to other vaccine providers when a particular vaccine or vaccines are not offered in the practice. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd"

However, little is known about the financial burden of readmissions and what patient, clinical, and hospital factors drive readmission costs. Questions/purposes: (1) What is the incidence, payer mix, and demographics of THA and TKA readmissions in the United States? (2) What patient, clinical, and hospital factors are associated with the cost of 30- and 90-day readmissions after primary THA and TKA? (3) Are there any differences in the economic burden of THA and TKA readmissions between payers? (4) What types of THA and TKA readmissions are most costly to the US hospital system? Methods: The recently developed Nationwide Readmissions Database from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (2006 hospitals from 21 states) was used to identify 719,394 primary TJAs and 62,493 90-day readmissions in the first 9 months of 2013 based on International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification codes. We classified the reasons for readmissions as either procedure- or medical-related. Cost-to-charge ratios supplied with the Nationwide Readmissions Database were used to compute the individual per-patient cost of 90-day readmissions as a continuous variable in separate general linear models for THA and TKA. Payer, patient, clinical, and hospital factors were treated as covariates. We estimated the national burden of readmissions by payer and by the reason for readmission. Results: The national rates of 30- and 90-day readmissions after THA were 4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.2%–4.5%) and 8% (95% CI, 7.5%–8.1%), respectively. The national rates of 30- and 90-day readmissions after primary TKA were 4% (95% CI, 3.8%–4.0%) and 7% (95% CI, 6.8%–7.2%), respectively. The five most important variables responsible for the cost of 90-day THA readmissions (in rank order, based on the Type III F-statistic, p < 0.001) were length of stay (LOS), all patient-refined diagnosis-related group (APR DRG) severity, type of readmission (that is, medical- versus procedure-related), hospital ownership, and age. Likewise, the five most important variables responsible for the cost of 90-day TKA readmissions were LOS, APR DRG severity, gender, hospital procedure volume, and hospital ownership. After adjusting for covariates, mean 90-day readmission costs reimbursed by private insurance were, on average, USD 1324 and USD 1372 greater than Medicare (p < 0.001) for THA and TKA, respectively. In the 90 days after TJA, two-thirds of the total annual readmission costs were covered by Medicare. In 90 days after THA, more readmissions were still associated with procedure-related complications, including infections, dislocations, and periprosthetic fractures, which in aggregate account for 59% (95% CI, 59.1%–59.6%) of the total readmission costs to the US healthcare system. For TKA, 49% of the total readmission cost (95% CI, 48.8%–49.6%) in 90 days for the United States was associated with procedure issues, most notably including infections. Conclusions: Hospital readmissions up to 90 days after TJA represent a massive economic burden on the US healthcare system. Approximately half of the total annual economic burden for readmissions in the United States is medical and unrelated to the joint replacement procedure and half is related to procedural complications. Clinical Relevance: This national study underscores LOS during readmission as a primary cost driver, suggesting that hospitals and doctors further optimize, to the extent possible, the clinical pathways for the hospitalization of readmitted patients. Because patients readmitted as a result of infection, dislocation, and periprosthetic fractures are the most costly types of readmissions, efforts to reduce the LOS for these types of readmissions will have the greatest impact on their economic burden. Additional clinical research is needed to determine the extent to which, if any, the LOS during readmissions can be reduced without sacrificing quality or access of care. © 2017 The Association of Bone and Joint Surgeons®"

Fifteen occupational therapists participated in an interview to answer open-ended questions related to their thoughts and perceptions regarding the impact and implications of the ACA on their practice. The participants were practicing in eight different states and worked in five different settings with clinical experience ranging from 3 to 38 years; their positions ranged from staff therapist to owner of a free-standing outpatient clinic. Qualitative content analysis was used to synthesize the interview transcripts. Results showed that therapists did not have sufficient knowledge on the various mandates and provisions of the ACA, or were uncertain about what implications the ACA would have on practice, with the ACA affecting some settings more than others. Data revealed the perceived impacts of the ACA on occupational therapy practice include greater attention on documenting outcome-focused care, external accountability pressures on productivity, conscientiousness about clients' insurance coverage, uncertainty about collaborative care delivery, and survival of small businesses. Findings suggest training regarding knowledge about and implications of different elements of the ACA is needed as well as practices needing to promote the services that occupational therapists can provide to improve cost-effectiveness and outcomes in collaborative care environments. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."

METHODS: First, members of cancer research centers and community-based institutions (n=252) were surveyed to assess the status of insurance denials, and then, a focused survey (n=77) collected denial details. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to examine associations between the receipt of denials and site characteristics. RESULTS: Overall, 62.7% of the initial survey respondents reported at least 1 insurance denial during 2014. Sites using a precertification process were 3.04 times more likely to experience denials (95% confidence interval, 1.55-5.99; P≤.001), and similar rates of denials were reported from sites located in states with preexisting clinical trial coverage laws versus states without them (82.3% vs 85.1%; χ=50.7; P≤.001). Among the focused survey sites, academic centers reported denials more often than community sites (71.4% vs 46.4%). The failure of plans to cover trial participation was cited as the most common reason provided for denials (n=33 [80.5%]), with nearly 80% of sites (n=61) not receiving a coverage response from the insurer within 72 hours. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the ACA's mandate for most insurers to cover routine care costs for cancer clinical trial participation, denials and delays continue. Denials may continue because some insurers remain exempt from the law, or they may signal an implementation failure. Delays in coverage may affect patient participation in trials. Additional efforts to eliminate this barrier will be needed to achieve federal initiatives to double the pace of cancer research over the next 5 years. Future work should assess the law's effectiveness at the patient level to inform these efforts. © 2017 American Cancer Society."

Methods: Data from the State Emergency Department Databases for Minnesota were analyzed for 2 years: 2008 and 2014. All individuals who presented to the ED with a dental problem were identified based on the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification with a primary diagnosis of 520.0-529.9.

Results: Between 2008 and 2014 there was a 18.8 percent increase in the number of all non-dental ED visits and a 9.7 percent decrease in the number of NTDC visits. In that time period, young adults 18-26 years old showed a significant decrease (19.3 percent, P<0.001) in the number of NTDC visits. Conclusions: The Minnesota experience suggests that the increase in Medicaid dental benefits through the ACA has significantly decreased NTDC visits, especially among young adults who were eligible for a dependent coverage policy that extends parents' health insurance to age 26.

Subgroups were defined by Latino heritage group, citizenship status, and language use. Measures of access and utilization included insurance status, delaying medical care, forgoing medical care, visiting the emergency department, and visiting a physician. Logistic regression models were used to estimate the odds of the outcomes. Time period and subgroup interaction terms were used to test the effects of the ACA. Results: Mexicans and Central Americans had lower odds of being insured than did non-Latino whites. After ACA implementation, most reductions in disparities occurred between Puerto Ricans and non-Latino whites. Limited impact of the ACA was observed by language and citizenship status.

For the general population, those with high financial and health insurance literacy were more likely to obtain insurance through Medicaid or the Marketplaces compared with being uninsured. The magnitude of coefficients for these predictors was similar to that of commonly used demographic covariates.

The ACA-mandated phasing out of disproportionate share hospital payments that supported charity care may aggravate care access for the residual uninsured. Objectives: To estimate excess deaths among the uninsured and the potential ACA impact on the basis of a recent cohort's mortality experience. We hypothesized a higher uninsured mortality risk than the available pre-2000 estimate because of worsening of care disparities owing to technology-driven advances in life-saving care. Design: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of the 1999 to 2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey respondents observed through 2011. We estimated (a)weighted Cox proportional mortality hazard of uninsured working-age adults adjusted for demographics, comorbidity, and lifestyle behaviors, (b) weighted mortality rates among the uninsured and insured within age and comorbidity strata, and (c) excess deaths because of uninsurance using the Institute of Medicine methodology. Setting: Noninstitutionalized US population. Participants: Adults aged 20 to 64 years. Main Outcome Measure: Mortality. Results: Of 7274 study-eligible respondents, 20.6% were uninsured and 478 died during follow-up, for an adjusted uninsured mortality hazard ratio of 1.57 (95% confidence interval, 1.12-2.21) versus privately insured, translating to 48 529 excess deaths among the population aged 25 to 64 years in 2011 (7.8% of total deaths in this age group). The estimated proportion of excess deaths was 52% higher than the pre-2000 cohort study. The mortality disparity increased with age and comorbidity. Conclusions: Findings support our hypotheses, and indicate that post-ACA, a residual 4.7% excess mortality among working-age adults will continue, about 30 428 excess deaths annually.

The Affordable Care Act (ACA) eliminated out-of-pocket expenditures for recommended services, including mammography and colonoscopy. The objective of this study was to determine changes in the uptake of mammography and colonoscopy among fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries before and after ACA implementation. METHODS: Using Medicare claims data, this study identified women who were 70 years old or older and had not undergone mammography in the previous 2 years and men and women who were 70 years old or older, were at increased risk for colorectal cancer, and had not undergone colonoscopy in the past 5 years. The receipt of procedures in the 2-year period before the ACA's implementation (2009-2010) and after its implementation (2011 to September 2012) was also identified. Multivariate generalized estimating equation models were used to determine the independent association and county-level quartile of median income and education with the receipt of testing. RESULTS: For mammography, a lower SES quartile was associated with less uptake, but the post-ACA disparities were smaller than those in the pre-ACA period. In addition, mammography rates increased from the pre-ACA period to the post-ACA period in all SES quartiles. For colonoscopy, in both the pre- and post-ACA periods, there was an association between uptake and educational level and, to some extent, income. However, there were no appreciable changes in colonoscopy and SES after implementation of the ACA.

The Affordable Care Act (ACA) requires tobacco cessation as a preventive service with no patient cost share for all FDA-approved cessation medications. Health plans have a vital role in supporting smoking cessation by managing medication access, but uncertainty remains on the gaps between smoking cessation requirements and what is actually occurring in practice. This study presents current cessation patterns, real-world drug costs and plan benefit design data, and estimates the 1- to 5-year pharmacy budget impact of providing ACA-required coverage for smoking cessation products to understand the fiscal impact to a US healthcare plan. Methods: A closed cohort budget impact model was developed in Microsoft Excel® to estimate current and projected costs for US payers (commercial, Medicare, Medicaid) covering smoking cessation medicines, with assumptions for coverage and smoking cessation product utilization based on current, real-world national and state-level trends for hypothetical commercial, Medicare, and Medicaid plans with 1 million covered lives. A Markov methodology with five health states captures quit attempt and relapse patterns. Results include the number of smokers attempting to quit, number of successful quitters, annual costs, and cost per-member per-month (PMPM). Results: The projected PMPM cost of providing coverage for smoking cessation medications is $0.10 for commercial, $0.06 for Medicare, and $0.07 for Medicaid plans, reflecting a low incremental PMPM impact of covering two attempts ranging from $0.01 for Medicaid to $0.02 for commercial and Medicare payers. Conclusion: The projected PMPM impact of covering two quit attempts with access to all seven cessation medications at no patient cost share remains low. Results of this study reinforce that the impact of adopting the ACA requirements for smoking cessation coverage will have a limited near-term impact on health plan’s budgets.

Research aim: This study examined workplace lactation support among Milwaukee County businesses 5 years after implementation of the Affordable Care Act's Break Time for Nursing Mothers provision. Methods: A cross-sectional survey of Milwaukee County businesses was conducted in the summer of 2015 that inquired about workplace policies, lactation spaces, and other lactation resources offered. Business supports were stratified based on employer sizes: large (> 500 employees), medium (50-499 employees), and small (20-49 employees). A lactation amenity score was calculated for each business based on lactation resources available. Results: Three hundred surveys were distributed and 71 businesses voluntarily completed the survey. Small employers were excluded from statistical analysis due to fewer responses (n = 8). Overall, 87.3% (n = 55) of respondents reported providing access to a multiuser space for lactation and 65.1% (n = 41) reported providing a designated lactation space. Large employers (n = 30) were more likely than medium employers (n = 33) to provide a designated lactation space for breastfeeding or expressing (86.7% vs. 45.5%, p <.001). Large employers' mean amenity score was significantly higher than that of medium employers (3.37 vs. 2.57, p =.014), and they were also more likely to offer additional supports including access to a lactation consultant, classes, and materials (46.7% vs. 12.1%, p <.01). Conclusion: Large employers provide more lactation support than medium employers in Milwaukee County. All employers, regardless of size, need to increase additional lactation support for women in the workplace. © The Author(s) 2016."

However, political psychology has found evidence of motivated reasoning, with citizens' accuracy motives often supplanted by biased searching for and evaluation of information to defend prior political attitudes, beliefs or identities. We conducted a survey experiment to evaluate motivated reasoning about the performance of the US Affordable Care Act (also known as Obamacare), which has been politically contentious. In the experiment, we randomly assigned a sample of US adults to either a politics prime, to encourage partisan motivated reasoning, or a health care needs prime, to encourage accuracy motived reasoning stemming from their own perceived need for health care. We then asked them to rate the strength of real performance information in the form of evidence statements about the Affordable Care Act and to choose real performance indicators from a graphical array. The findings show that the political prime strengthened partisan differences in both the ratings of evidence statements and the selection of performance indicators. Thus, for contentious public programs where partisan identities are activated, partisan motivated reasoning influences how citizens process performance information and thus may limit its potential for enhancing democratic accountability. © The Author 2016.

This investigation examined whether the type of insurance (Medicaid, Medicare, Blue Cross, cash pay) carried by trauma patients influences access to pain management specialty care. Methods: Investigators phoned 443 board-certified pain specialists, securing office visits with 235 pain physicians from 8 different states. Appointments for painmanagement were for a patient who sustained an ankle fracture requiring surgery and experiencing difficulty weaning off opioids. Offices were phoned 4 times assessing responses to the 4 different payment methodologies. Results: Fifty-three percent of pain specialists contacted (235 of 443) were willing to see new patients to manage pain medication. Within the 53% of positive responses, 7.2% of physicians scheduled appointments for Medicaid patients, compared with 26.8%for cash-paying patients, 39.6%for those withMedicare, and 41.3%with Blue Cross (P < 0.0001). There were no differences in appointment access between states that had expanded Medicaid eligibility for low-income adults versus states that had not expandedMedicaid eligibility. Neither Medicaid norMedicare reimbursement levels for new patient visits correlated with ability to schedule an appointment or influenced wait times. Conclusions: Access to pain specialists for management of pain medication in the postoperative trauma patient proved challenging. Despite the Affordable Care Act, Medicaid patients still experienced curtailed access to pain specialists and confronted the highest incidence of barriers to receiving appointments.

We estimated that the ACA resulted in an increase of 8,400 (8 percent) diagnoses of early-stage colorectal cancer among US seniors in the period 2011-13. However, the ACA had no distinguishable effect on the number of diagnoses of earlystage breast cancer over the same time period.

In this article we shed light on these changing dynamics. We drew upon multistate transition models fit to nationally representative longitudinal data to estimate coverage transition probabilities between major insurance types in the years leading up to and including 2014. We found that the ACA's unprecedented coverage changes increased transitions to Medicaid and nongroup coverage among the uninsured, while strengthening the existing employer-sponsored insurance system and improving retention of public coverage. However, our results suggest possible weakness of state Marketplaces, since people gaining nongroup coverage were disproportionately older than other potential enrollees. We identified key opportunities for policy makers and insurers to improve underlying Marketplace risk pools by focusing on people transitioning from employer-sponsored coverage; these people are disproportionately younger and saw almost no change in their likelihood of becoming uninsured in 2014 compared to earlier years. © 2017 Project HOPE-The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc."

The USA feels the need to provide 48 million residents with health insurance. The Affordable Care Act has this goal, but the several factors have limited its capacity and implementation. The purpose of this paper is to discuss this reform, paying attention to its potential implications for the human and economic development of both the USA and the rest of the world. The authors show that developed countries also need policies for enhancing human development and also the developing world may benefit from policy changes in the ""first world."" Design/methodology/approach: The methodology is based on discursive discussion. The argumentation first presents the reform, and highlights its advantages and its flaws for the citizens of both the USA and of developing countries. Findings: The authors claim that the reform presents some flaws that render it still insufficient to cover all the health needs of the poor in the USA. However, the reform is likely to attract more immigrant workers to the USA, since it is likely to improve the living conditions of immigrants as well as those of their families. Originality/value: The original point of the paper is the link between the reform and the benefits for non-US citizens. The extant literature has widely discussed the impact of the reform on the domestic market and on the US citizens. The authors widen this perspective showing that an important reform in a large country may be beneficial for people living elsewhere as well. © Emerald Publishing Limited."

In addition, more patients are requiring critical care services and physician numbers are not keeping with this growing need. Restrictions on resident physician practice hours have impacted inpatient care as well.

This article shows how one large highly-matrixed health care system approached identifying this workforce, and how thought leaders worked collaboratively with physicians, administrators, and ACPs to meet a growing demand for providers. Carolinas HealthCare System developed a 3-pronged approach to this opportunity. The development of a Center for Advanced Practice was explored and implemented. This Center serves as a 2-way conduit of information and ideas between system administrators and providers. It also serves as a central source of regulatory and practice information for administrators and providers. The growing number of open ACP positions, along with the reluctance to employ novice and new graduate ACPs, led to the development of a postgraduate transition to practice fellowship program. This program's clinical tracks and curriculum are described. Finally, a collaborative effort between the health care system and a local university resulted in the local offering of an acute care nurse practitioner program, which allowed system nurses to continue their education without the need for relocation.

This case study examines the human factors of extensive redesign on 2 midsized primary care clinics (clinics A and B) in the Midwest United States that are owned by a large health care system. The transition occurred when while the principles for patient-centered medical home were being rolled out nationally, and before the Affordable Care Act. Methods: After the transition, interviews and discussions were conducted with 5 stakeholder groups: health system leaders, clinic managers, clinicians, nurses, and reception staff. Using a culture assessment instrument, the responses of personnel at clinics A and B were compared with comparison clinics from another health system that had not undergone transition. Patient satisfaction scores are presented. Results: Clinics A and B were similar in size and staffing. Three human factor themes emerged from interviews: responses to change, professional and personal challenges due to role redefinition, and the importance of communication. The comparison clinics had an equal or higher mean culture scores compared with the transition clinics (A and B). Patient satisfaction in improved in Clinic A. Conclusions: The transition took more time than expected. Health system leaders underestimated the stress and the role adjustments for clinicians and nurses. Change leaders need to anticipate the challenge of role redefinition until health profession schools graduate trainees with more experience in new models of team-based care. Incorporating experience with team based, interprofessional care into training is essential to properly prepare future health professionals."

Hence, linking employment and health insurance creates a wedge between the marginal cost and benefit of insurance. We study the impact of this wedge on occupational choice and welfare in a general equilibrium model. Agents face idiosyncratic health expenditure shocks, have heterogeneous managerial and worker productivity, and choose whether to be workers or entrepreneurs. First, we consider a private insurance indemnity policy that removes the link between employment and health insurance, so only ability matters for occupational choice. By construction, this is the most efficient policy. We find a welfare gain of 2.28% from decoupling health insurance and employment. Second, we tighten the link by increasing employment-based health insurance from the current U.S. level of 62% to 100%, and find a welfare loss of – 0.61%. © 2016 Elsevier Inc."

Research Design: Cross-sectional data from Kentucky's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System was linked to county data from the Area Health Resource File, and we used logistic regression models to assess relationships between both person-level and county-level characteristics with uninsured status. Subjects: The study sample included nonelderly adults aged 18-64 residing in Kentucky during the time of the survey. Results: Before the implementation of the Medicaid expansion and rollout of the state-based health insurance marketplace, adults who were younger (aged 18-47), unmarried, had lower levels of educational attainment, and considered to be low income were more likely to be uninsured. However, many but not all of these differences faded away by the end of 2014 when only unemployment, low-income status, and Hispanic ethnicity were positively correlated with being uninsured.

The effect of insurance status on the incidence of these adverse quality events is also unknown. Purpose This study determined the incidence of hospital-acquired conditions (HAC) and patient safety indicators (PSI) in patients with cervical spine fusion and analyzed the association between primary payer status and these adverse events. Study Design This is a retrospective cohort design. Patient Sample All patients in the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) aged 18 and older who underwent cervical spine fusion from 1998 to 2011 were included. Outcome Measures Incidence of HAC and PSI from 1998 to 2011 served as outcome variables. Methods We queried the NIS for all hospitalizations that included a cervical fusion during the inpatient episode from 1998 to 2011. All comparisons were made between privately insured patients and Medicaid or self-pay patients because Medicare enrollment is confounded with age. Incidence of nontraumatic HAC and PSI was determined using publicly available lists of International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) diagnosis codes. We built logistic regression models to determine the effect of primary payer status on PSI and nontraumatic HAC. Results We identified 419,424 hospitalizations with cervical fusion performed during an inpatient episode. The estimated national incidences of nontraumatic HAC and PSI were 0.35% and 1.6%, respectively. After adjusting for patient demographics and hospital characteristics, Medicaid or self-pay patients had significantly greater odds of experiencing one or more HAC (odds ratio [OR] 1.51 95% conflict of interest [CI] 1.23–1.84) or PSI (OR 1.52 95% CI 1.37–1.70) than the privately insured cohort. Conclusions Among patients undergoing inpatient cervical fusion, primary payer status predicts PSI and HAC (both indicators of adverse health-care quality used to determine hospital reimbursement by CMS). As the US health-care system transitions to a value-based payment model, the cause of these disparities must be studied to improve the quality of care delivered to vulnerable patient populations. © 2016 Elsevier Inc."

There is a need for high-quality, economic evaluations of nursing practice. An updated review of completed economic evaluations relevant to the field of nursing within the U.S. healthcare system is timely and needed. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to evaluate and describe the quantity and quality of economic evaluations in nursing-relevant research performed in the United States between 1997 and 2015. Methods: Four databases were searched. Titles, abstracts, and full-text content were reviewed to identify studies that analyzed both costs and outcomes, relevant to nursing, performed in the United States, and used the quality-adjusted life year to measure effectiveness. For included studies, data were extracted from full-text articles using criteria from U.S. Public Health Service's Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in Health and Medicine. Results: Twenty-eight studies met the inclusion criteria. Most (n = 25, 89%) were published in the last decade of the analysis, from 2006 to 2015. Assessment of quality, based on selected items from the panel guidelines, found that the evaluations did not consistently use the recommended societal perspective, use multiple resource utilization categories, use constant dollars, discount future costs and outcomes, use a lifetime horizon, or include an indication of uncertainty in results. The only resource utilization category consistently included across studies was healthcare resources. Discussion: Only 28 nursing-related studies meeting the inclusion criteria were identified as meeting robust health economic evaluation methodological criteria, and most did not include all important guideline items. Despite increases in absolute numbers of published studies over the past decade, economic evaluation has been underutilized in U.S. nursing-relevant research in the past two decades.

The unsustainability of the fee-for-service payment system has lead Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to employ new value and risk-based contracting strategies on a population health basis and on an episode of care basis, with programs such as the Bundled Payment for Care Improvement program and the Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement program. These trends are forcing hospitals and physicians to align to improve quality and reduce costs through new structures such as Accountable Care Organizations, comanagement programs, and gainsharing. Bundled payment programs are typically used to align specialists such as orthopedic surgeons and TJR has been on the forefront of bundled payment contracting strategies. Bundled payment programs with commercial insurers can create additional opportunities, as do commercial bundled payment contracts for TJR performed on an outpatient basis. As these programs are now becoming mandatory, surgeons must understand the structural aspects of these arrangements and the levers available to optimize the likelihood of success."

However, few data are available assessing employers’ awareness of the law or its implementation. Objectives The study aims were to 1) describe New Orleans employers' awareness of the law, 2) determine the extent of the law implementation within workplaces, and 3) determine the associations between workplace characteristics and employers’ awareness and implementation. Methods A cross-sectional survey was mailed to 652 workplaces with more than 50 employees in New Orleans, Louisiana, in the fall of 2013. A random sample of those who did not respond was called. The survey included questions about the industry category, number and type of employees, the employers’ awareness of the law, if they had begun to implement the law, and their perceptions of barriers to implementation. Results The final sample included 182 workplaces (27.9% response rate). Eighty-seven participants (47.8%) reported having heard of the law. However, 52.7% of the participants (n = 96) responded that they had begun to implement the law.

We described the scope of health care required for all living kidney donors, reflecting contemporary understanding of long-term donor health outcomes; proposed an approach to identify donor health conditions that should be covered within the framework of financial neutrality; and proposed strategies to pay for this care. Despite the Affordable Care Act in the United States, donors continue to have inadequate coverage for important health conditions that are donation related or that may compromise postdonation kidney function. Amendment of Medicare regulations is needed to clarify that surveillance and treatment of conditions that may compromise postdonation kidney function following donor nephrectomy will be covered without expense to the donor. In other countries lacking health insurance for all residents, sufficient data exist to allow the creation of a compensation fund or donor insurance policies to ensure appropriate care. Providing coverage for donation-related sequelae as well as care to preserve postdonation kidney function ensures protection against the financial burdens of health care encountered by donors throughout their lives.

However, the high cost of buprenorphine and the limited prescribing capacity may restrict access to this effective medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorder. Objective: To examine whether Medicaid expansion and physician prescribing capacity may have impacted buprenorphine utilization covered by Medicaid. Research Design: We used a quasi experimental difference-in-differences design to compare the pre-post changes in Medicaid-covered buprenorphine prescriptions and buprenorphine spending between the 26 states that implemented Medicaid expansions under the Affordable Care Act in 2014 and those that did not. Subjects: All Medicaid enrollees in the expansion states and the nonexpansion and late-expansion states. Measures: Quarterly Medicaid prescriptions for buprenorphine and spending on buprenorphine from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Medicaid Drug Utilization files 2011 to 2014. Results: State implementation of Medicaid expansions in 2014 was associated with a 70% increase (P<0.05) in Medicaid-covered buprenorphine prescriptions and a 50% increase (P<0.05) in buprenorphine spending. Physician prescribing capacity was also associated with increased buprenorphine utilization. Conclusions: Medicaid expansion has the potential to reduce the financial barriers to buprenorphine utilization and improve access to medication-assisted treatment of opioid use disorder. Active physician participation in the provision of buprenorphine is needed for ensuring that Medicaid expansion achieves its full potential in improving treatment access.

A literature search was conducted to construct a model of care coordination for elective surgical procedures by collecting best practices for acute, transitions, and post-acute care periods.

Care management defines care coordination as a model of care to address improving patient and caregiver engagement, communication across settings of care, and ultimately improved patient outcomes of care. Nurse-led care coordination in the presurgical, inpatient, and post-acute care settings requires systems change and administrative support to effectively meet the goals of the Affordable Care Act of reducing redundancy and costs while improving the patient experience. Nursing is the lynchpin of care management processes in all settings of care; thus, this model of care coordination for elective surgical admissions can provide nursing care management leaders a comprehensive view of coordinating care for these patient across settings of care during the predetermined time period of care.

In the period after expansion (2014-15), health centers in expansion states had a 5 percent higher total patient volume, larger shares of Medicaid patients, smaller shares of uninsured patients, and increases in overall visits and mental health visits, compared to centers in nonexpansion states. Increases in federal grant funding levels were associated with increases in numbers of patients and of overall, medical, and preventive service visits.

Hospitals, physicians, and other clinicians are experimenting with new models of care designed to better meet patients' needs, reduce administrative burdens, and lower costs. The Affordable Care Act placed the Medicare and Medicaid programs at the center of a national effort to experiment with delivery and payment models designed to improve care and contain costs. These public-sector efforts have often aligned with private initiatives, such as the use of reference pricing-in which an insurer will only pay for a service at the price available from the lowest-cost provider. Employers in the public and private sectors have adopted value-based insurance design, in which copayments and deductibles are calibrated to the clinical benefit obtained from different services. Patients have the most to gain-or lose-from delivery innovations. Better, more efficient care should translate into better health and lower costs, but payment models designed to encourage innovation may have the unintended effect of limiting access to care. © 2017 Project HOPE- The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc."

Efforts are under way to improve and expand substance use disorder (SUD) treatment for criminally active populations. Model nontreatment interventions seek to monitor and deter use among individuals whose use endangers others. Two key issues are the continuing high rate of alcohol-related crime and violence and opportunities to expand SUD treatment for criminally active populations under the Affordable Care Act (ACA).

Understanding how Medicaid responds to such forces is important to budget analysts and policy makers tasked with forecasting Medicaid enrollment. We simulated eligibility for Medicaid for the period 2005-14 in two scenarios: Assuming that each state's eligibility rules in 2009, the year before passage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), were in place during the entire study period; and assuming that the ACA's expanded eligibility rules were in place during the entire period for all states. Then we correlated the results with unemployment rates as a measure of the economy. Each percentage-point increase in the unemployment rate was associated with an increase in the share of people eligible for Medicaid of 0.32 percentage point under the 2009 eligibility rules and 0.77 percentage point under the ACA rules. Our simulations showed that the ACA expansion increased Medicaid's responsiveness to changes in unemployment.

In this article, we advocate for RN prescribing as an expanded role in the United States. METHODS: We reviewed the literature on RN prescribing, the background in both high- and low-resource countries, levels of prescribing, specialized settings for RN prescribing, both RN and patients views/perceptions of prescribing, and evaluation research. From this review, we developed a proposal for RN prescribing. FINDINGS: Due to expansion of RNs into prescribing worldwide to meet unmet healthcare needs in both primary and specialty settings, we propose a role for RN prescribing within both primary care and outpatient specialty settings. The differences between RN and advanced practice RN prescribing are defined, and U.S.-based regulatory challenges are examined.

Premium growth measured by plans purchased was roughly 2 percentage points less than when measured by plans offered in 2014-15 and 2015-16.

To examine the impact on individuals' use of care and costs, linked information is needed on both the characteristics of the medical providers' organizations and the individuals receiving care. There is currently no nationally representative data source that provides this essential information. Consequently, a Medical Organizations Survey (MOS) has been added as a component of the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) to address this limitation. The MEPS-MOS will obtain essential data on provider organizational characteristics, policies, and treatment protocols for a nationally representative sample of physicians providing care to MEPS participants. This paper describes the survey and sample design of the MEPS-MOS, survey content and precision targets and its analytical focus.

We used a difference-in-differences approach to compare changes among 1,057 such centers in expansion versus nonexpansion states from 2011 to 2014, in terms of their patients' insurance coverage, the number of patients they served, and the quality of care they provided. Medicaid expansion was associated with large increases (12 percentage points) in Medicaid coverage and corresponding declines (11 percentage points) in uninsurance rates. The numbers of patients served increased in both expansion and nonexpansion states, and the magnitude of increase did not differ significantly between the groups of states. Medicaid expansion was associated with improved quality on four of eight measures examined: Asthma treatment, Pap testing, body mass index assessment, and hypertension control.

While the number of hospital mergers and the size of specialty-oriented physician groups increased after the ACA was passed, we found minimal evidence that consolidation was associated with ACO penetration at the market level or with physicians' participation in ACOs within markets.

Objectives: To assess the impact of parental health insurance expansions from 1999 to 2012 on the likelihood that parents are insured; their children are insured; both the parent and child within a family unit are insured; and the type of insurance. Design: Cross-sectional analysis of the 2000-2013 March supplements to the Current Population Survey, with data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey - Insurance Component and the Area Resource File. Methods: Cross-state and within-state multivariable regression models estimated the effects of health insurance expansions targeting parents using 2-way fixed effect modeling and difference-in-difference modeling. All analyses controlled for household, parent, child, and local area characteristics that could affect insurance status. Results: Expansions increased parental coverage by 2.5 percentage points, and increased the likelihood of both parent and child being insured by 2.1 percentage points. Substantial variation was observed by type of expansion. Public expansions without premiums and special subsidized plan expansions had the largest effects on parental coverage and increased the likelihood of jointly insuring both the parent and child. Higher premiums were a substantial deterrent to parents' insurance.

To maintain this status, they must provide benefit to the community they serve. In an attempt to improve accountability to these communities and the federal government, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 includes a provision that requires all nonprofit hospitals to conduct a community health needs assessment (CHNA) and implement strategies to address identified health priorities every 3 years. This Act's provision, operationalized by a regulation developed and enforced by the Internal Revenue Service, mandates the involvement of public health agencies and other community stakeholders in the completion of the CHNA. Objective: To better understand community participation in nonprofit hospital-directed community health assessment and health improvement planning activities. Design: Using a 2-phased, mixed-methods study design, we (1) conducted content analysis of 95 CHNA/implementation plan reports and (2) interviewed hospital and health system key informants, consultants, and community stakeholders involved in CHNA and planning processes. Community participation was assessed in terms of types of stakeholders involved and the depth of their involvement. Results: Our findings suggest that many hospitals engaged and involved community stakeholders in certain aspects of the assessment process, but very few engaged a broad array of community stakeholder and community members in meaningful participation throughout the CHNA and health improvement planning process. Vast improvements in community participation and collaborative assessment and planning can be made in future CHNAs. Conclusions: On the basis of the findings, recommendations are made for further research.

Safety-net providers, however, still serve a substantial uninsured population, and clinician and patient time remain limited in all primary care settings. As a consequence, decision makers continue to set priorities to help focus their efforts. This report updates estimates of relative health impact and cost-effectiveness for evidence-based preventive services. METHODS We assessed the potential impact of 28 evidence-based clinical preventive services in terms of their cost-effectiveness and clinically preventable burden, as measured by quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) saved. Each service received 1 to 5 points on each of the 2 measures—cost-effectiveness and clinically preventable burden—for a total score ranging from 2 to 10. New microsimulation models were used to provide updated estimates of 12 of these services. Priorities for improving delivery rates were established by comparing the ranking with what is known of current delivery rates nationally. RESULTS The 3 highest-ranking services, each with a total score of 10, are immunizing children, counseling to prevent tobacco initiation among youth, and tobacco-use screening and brief intervention to encourage cessation among adults. Greatest population health improvement could be obtained from increasing utilization of clinical preventive services that address tobacco use, obesityrelated behaviors, and alcohol misuse, as well as colorectal cancer screening and influenza vaccinations.

Methods: We received specialty BH insurance claims and eligibility data from Optum, sampling 5,987,776 adults enrolled in selfinsured plans from large employers. An interrupted time series study design with segmented regression analysis estimated monthly time trends of per-member spending and use before (2008-2009), during (2010), and after (2011-2013) MHPAEA compliance (N = 179,506,951 member-month observations). Outcomes included: total, plan, patient out-of-pocket spending; outpatient utilization (assessment/diagnostic evaluation visits, medication management, individual and family psychotherapy); intermediate care utilization (structured outpatient, day treatment, residential); and inpatient utilization. Results: MHPAEA was associated with increases in monthly permember total spending, plan spending, assessment/diagnostic evaluation visits [respective immediate increases of: $1.05 (P = 0.02); $0.88 (P = 0.04); 0.00045 visits (P = 0.00)], and individual psychotherapy visits [immediate increase of 0.00578 visits (P = 0.00) and additional increases of 0.00017 visits/mo (P = 0.03)]. Conclusions: MHPAEA was associated with modest increases in total and plan spending and outpatient utilization; for example, in July 2012 predicted per-enrollee plan spending was $4.92 without MHPAEA and $6.14 with MHPAEA. Efforts should focus on understanding how other barriers to BH care unaddressed by MHPAEA may affect access/utilization.

Methods: The Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Nationwide Inpatient Sample database was used to identify patients who were treated for PHF from 2002 to 2012. Primary outcomes included treatment type, surgical fixation method, in-hospital complications, mean length of stay, and mean total charges for Medicaid patients vs. a matched privately insured cohort. In an effort to minimize confounding variables, each Medicaid patient was matched to a privately insured patient on the basis of gender, race, year of procedure, and age. Results: Of the 678,831 patients treated with PHF, 4.9% (33,263) had Medicaid as the primary payer during the 10-year period.

Prior research has examined the cost‐effectiveness of contraception in general; however, no studies have developed a formal decision model in the context of the new ACA provisions. As such, this study aims to estimate the relative cost‐effectiveness of insurance coverage of contraception under employer-sponsored insurance coverage taking into consideration newer regulations allowing for religious exemptions. Study design A decision model was developed from the employer perspective to simulate pregnancy costs and outcomes associated with insurance coverage. Method-specific estimates of contraception failure rates, outcomes and costs were derived from the literature. Uptake by marital status and age was drawn from a nationally representative database. Results Providing no contraception coverage resulted in 33 more unintended pregnancies per 1000 women (95% confidence range: 22.4; 44.0). This subsequently significantly increased the number of unintended births and terminations. Total costs were higher among uninsured women owing to higher costs of pregnancy outcomes. The effect of no insurance was greatest on unmarried women 20–29 years old. Conclusions Denying female employees’ full coverage of contraceptives increases total costs from the employer perspective, as well as the total number of terminations. Implications Insurance coverage was found to be significantly associated with women's choice of contraceptive method in a large nationally representative sample. Using a decision model to extrapolate to pregnancy outcomes, we found a large and statistically significant difference in unintended pregnancy and terminations.

Study design We used the Vanderbilt Television News Archives and LexisNexis Database to obtain video and print transcripts of all relevant national network television news segments covering contraception from January 2010 to June 2014. We conducted a content analysis of 116 TV news segments covering contraception during the rollout of the Affordable Care Act. Segments were quantitatively coded for contraceptive methods covered, story sources used, and inclusion of medical and nonmedical content (intercoder reliability using Krippendorf's alpha ranged 0.6–1 for coded categories). Results Most (55%) news stories focused on contraception in general rather than specific methods. The most effective contraceptive methods were rarely discussed (implant, 1%; intrauterine device, 4%). The most frequently used sources were political figures (40%), advocates (25%), the general public (25%) and Catholic Church leaders (16%); medical professionals (11%) and health researchers (4%) appeared in a minority of stories. A minority of stories (31%) featured medical content. Conclusions National network news coverage of contraception frequently focuses on contraception in political and social terms and uses nonmedical figures such as politicians and church leaders as sources. This focus deemphasizes the public health aspect of contraception, leading medical professionals and health content to be rarely featured.

Multinomial logit regressions estimated the probability of admissions to hospitals classified as high, medium, or low quality on the basis of risk-adjusted, in-hospital mortality. Results: Compared with patients who have private insurance, those with Medicaid or no insurance were more likely to be minorities and to reside in areas with low-socioeconomic status. The probability of admission to high-quality hospitals was similar for patients with Medicaid (23.3%) and private insurance (23.0%) but was significantly lower for patients without insurance (19.8%, P < 0.01) compared with the other 2 insurance groups. Accounting for demographic, socioeconomic, and clinical characteristics did not influence the results. Conclusions: Previously noted disparities in hospital quality of care for Medicaid recipients are not explained by differences in the quality of hospitals they use. Patients without insurance have lower use of high-quality hospitals, a finding that needs exploration with data after 2013 in light of the Affordable Care Act, which is designed to improve access to medical care for patients without insurance.

Recently, completing a CHA has become a prerequisite for LHDs seeking accreditation by the Public Health Accreditation Board (PHAB). Similarly, under the Affordable Care Act, nonprofit hospitals are required to conduct periodic community health needs assessments (CHNAs). Opportunities thus exist for LHDs and hospitals to jointly complete CHAs/CHNAs. Objective: This study examined existing LHD-hospital collaborations around CHAs/CHNAs, focusing specifically on the relationship between LHDs' level of engagement with PHAB accreditation activities and their collaboration with hospitals around CHAs/CHNAs. Design: Data came from the 2013 NACCHO (National Association of County & City Health Officials) Profile Study and the Area Health Resource File. Complete data were available for 1332 LHDs that participated in the 2013 NACCHO Profile Study. Logistic regression explored the relationship between LHDs' completion of accreditation prerequisites, in particular completion of a CHA, community health improvement plan, and strategic plan, and their involvement in collaborations with tax-exempt hospitals around CHAs/CHNAs. Results: LHDs that collaborated with tax-exempt hospitals on CHAs/CHNAs were larger, more likely to be locally governed, and more likely to have a local board of health. Bivariate analysis showed that CHA/CHNA-related collaboration with hospitals was significantly correlated (P <.01) with an LHD's completion of accreditation prerequisites. In multivariate regression analysis, completion of all 3 PHAB accreditation prerequisites significantly increased the odds of LHDs collaborating with hospitals when controlling for other LHD and community-level characteristics. Conclusion: PHAB accreditation prerequisites together with IRS requirements for hospitals foster potential for collaboration around CHAs/CHNAs. Joint completion of CHAs/CHNAs not only allows partners to complete the assessment more efficiently but has also been shown to produce higher-quality assessments, thus building a strong foundation for continued collaboration to improve community health. © 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Little is known about how insurance enrollment within states affects treatment program decisions about whether to offer medications. The primary objective of the study was to examine the impact of health insurance enrollment on availability of substance use disorder medications among treatment programs. Methods: Data from the 2012 National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services, National Survey on Drug Use and Health, American Community Survey, Area Health Resource File, and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration were combined to examine the impact of state insurance enrollment on availability of substance use disorder medications in treatment programs (N=9,888). A two-level, random-intercept logistic regression model was estimated to account for potential unobserved heterogeneity among treatment programs nested in states. Results: The percentage of state residents with employerbased insurance and Medicaid was associated with greater odds of offering at least one medication among treatment programs. A 5% increase in the rate of private insurance enrollment was associated with a 7.7% increase in the probability of offering at least one medication, and a 5% increase in the rate of state Medicaid enrollment was associated with a 9.3% increase in the probability of offering at least one medication. Conclusions: Results point to the potential significance of health insurance enrollment in shaping the availability of substance use disorder medications. Significant expansions in health insurance enrollment spurred by the Affordable Care Act have the potential to increase access to medications for many Americans."

Even among the insured, substantial barriers to accessing services inhibit health care utilization. Objectives: We examined the effect of selected barriers to health care access and the magnitude of those barriers on health care utilization. Research Design: Data come from a 2008 survey of adult enrollees in Minnesota's public health care programs. We used multivariate logistic regression to estimate the effects of perceived patient, provider, and system-level barriers on past year delayed, foregone, and lack of preventive care. Subjects: A total of 2194 adults enrolled in Minnesota Health Care Programs who were mostly female (66%), high school graduates (76%), unemployed (62%), and living in metro areas (67%) were included in the analysis. Results: Reporting problems across all barriers increased the odds of delayed care from 2 times for provider-related barriers (OR=2.0; 95% CI, 1.2-3.3) to >6 times for access barriers (OR=6.2; 95% CI, 3.8-10.2) and foregone care from 2.6 times for family/work barriers (OR=2.6; 95% CI, 1.3-5.1) to >7 times for access barriers (OR=7.1; 95% CI, 3.9-13.1). Perceived discrimination was the only barrier consistently associated with all 3 utilization outcomes. Conclusions: Multiple types of barriers are associated with delayed and foregone care. System-level barriers and discrimination have the greatest effect on health care seeking behavior. © 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved."

Methods: A retrospective database study using the 2012 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey was conducted. Adults (≥18 years) with a COPD diagnosis who received COPD-related healthcare services at least once in 2012 were included. The dependent variable was annual OOP expenditures and the independent variable was health insurance type. Descriptive statistics, regression for complex sampling design and a two-part model (TPM) were conducted using SAS and STATA. Key findings: Subjects' (N = 587 unweighted; N = 5,982,925 weighted) total mean ± SE OOP COPD expenditures were $236.2 ± 45.1. TPM analysis showed that there was no difference in having OOP expenditures versus no OOP expenditures by insurance status. Among those having OOP expenditures, compared to subjects with private insurance, those with no insurance had 4.8 times higher OOP expenditures (OR; 95% CI: 4.754 (2.069, 10.935)). Inpatient OOP expenditures and ambulatory care visit OOP expenditures were significantly higher for subjects with no insurance ($4,631.7 ± 1,753.7 and $77.9 ± 14.0 respectively) than for those privately insured ($186.9 ± 167.8 and $35.0 ± 5.3 respectively). Regarding prescription expenditures, there were no statistically significant differences in OOP expenditures when stratified by insurance status. Conclusions: Compared to insured subjects, those with no insurance had higher OOP expenditures for COPD-related total, inpatient and ambulatory care services.

The goal of this study was to determine the availability of follow-up orthopedic care by insurance status. Methods: Using simulated patient methodology, all 102 eligible general orthopedic practices in Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas, were contacted twice by a caller requesting follow-up for an ankle fracture diagnosed in a local ED using a standardized script that differed by insurance status. Practices were randomly assigned to paired private and uninsured or Medicaid and uninsured scenarios. Results: We completed 204 calls: 59 private, 43 Medicaid, and 102 uninsured. Appointment success rate was 83.1% for privately insured (95% confidence interval [CI] = 73.2% to 92.9%), 81.4% for uninsured (95% CI = 73.7% to 89.1%), and 14.0% for Medicaid callers (95% CI = 3.2% to 24.7%). Controlling for paired calls to the same practice, an uninsured caller had 5.7 times higher odds (95% CI = 2.74 to 11.71) of receiving an appointment than a Medicaid caller (p < 0.001), but the same odds as a privately insured caller (odds ratio = 1.0, 95% CI = 0.19 to 5.37, p = 1.0). Uninsured patients had to bring a median of $350 (interquartile range = $250 to $400) to their appointment to be seen, and only two uninsured patients were able to obtain an appointment for 100 or less up front. In comparison, typical total payments collected for privately insured patients were 236 and for Medicaid patients $128. When asked where else they could go, 49 (48%) uninsured callers and one Medicaid caller (2%) were directed to local public hospital EDs as alternative sources of care. Of the practices that appeared on Medicaid's published list of orthopedic providers accepting new patients, 15 told callers that they did not accept Medicaid, 11 did not treat ankles, nine listed nonworking phone numbers, and only three actually scheduled an appointment for the Medicaid caller. Conclusions: Less than one in seven Medicaid patients could obtain orthopedic follow-up after an ED visit for a fracture, and prices quoted to the uninsured were 30% higher than typical negotiated rates paid by the privately insured. High up-front costs for uninsured patients and low appointment availability for Medicaid patients may leave these patients with no other option than the ED for necessary care. © 2016 by the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine"

Incidence data were collected by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program; the National Program of Cancer Registries; and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries. Mortality data were collected by the National Center for Health Statistics. In 2017, 1,688,780 new cancer cases and 600,920 cancer deaths are projected to occur in the United States. For all sites combined, the cancer incidence rate is 20% higher in men than in women, while the cancer death rate is 40% higher. However, sex disparities vary by cancer type. For example, thyroid cancer incidence rates are 3-fold higher in women than in men (21 vs 7 per 100,000 population), despite equivalent death rates (0.5 per 100,000 population), largely reflecting sex differences in the “epidemic of diagnosis.” Over the past decade of available data, the overall cancer incidence rate (2004-2013) was stable in women and declined by approximately 2% annually in men, while the cancer death rate (2005-2014) declined by about 1.5% annually in both men and women. From 1991 to 2014, the overall cancer death rate dropped 25%, translating to approximately 2,143,200 fewer cancer deaths than would have been expected if death rates had remained at their peak. Although the cancer death rate was 15% higher in blacks than in whites in 2014, increasing access to care as a result of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act may expedite the narrowing racial gap; from 2010 to 2015, the proportion of blacks who were uninsured halved, from 21% to 11%, as it did for Hispanics (31% to 16%).

Expansion has the potential to increase the availability of health services to patients, including prescription medications. However, limited studies have examined how expansion affected prescription drug utilization and reimbursement. OBJECTIVE: To compare prescription drug utilization (number of prescriptions filled) and reimbursement trends between states that did and did not expand Medicaid coverage in 2014, while accounting for known effects of expansion on Medicaid enrollment. METHODS: We conducted a comparative interrupted time series using retrospective Medicaid state drug utilization data from 2011 to 2014. After inclusion/exclusion criteria, 8 states that expanded Medicaid in 2014 and 10 states that did not expand Medicaid were studied. Primary outcomes were changes in quarterly prescription drug utilization and quarterly total prescription drug reimbursement before and after expansion. To account for increases in enrollment in expansion states, secondary outcomes were per-member-per-quarter (PMPQ) utilization and reimbursement before and after expansion. RESULTS: Expansion states experienced a 1.4 million prescriptions per quarter and $163 million per quarter increase in utilization and reimbursement above the change in rates observed in nonexpansion states after expansion (P < 0.001). Specifically, 1 year after ACA implementation, expansion states used 17.0% more prescriptions and spent 36.1% more in reimbursement than the quarter preceding expansion. Expansion and nonexpansion states experienced significant drops in PMPQ prescriptions immediately after expansion (P < 0.001), but PMPQ prescriptions and reimbursement trends increased by the end of the postexpansion period in expansion states (P < 0.029 and P < 0.001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Study results suggest that Medicaid expansion offers vulnerable patients who were previously uninsured increased access to health care resources, specifically prescription drugs. Although this hypothesis would benefit from further testing, it aligns with previous studies that have shown that Medicaid expansion has led to increased access to coverage and care. While enrollment contributes to the increase in prescription utilization and reimbursement, the drop in PMPQ utilization suggests that the patients entering the program are healthier than existing patients. This shows that risk pooling is working. However, the increase in PMPQ reimbursement suggests that new enrollment may not be the only factor driving reimbursement changes. Factors such as changes in product mix, risk pool composition, and drug pricing and their effects on total and per-member reimbursement should be evaluated in future studies."

However, millions of adults remain uninsured or underinsured. Compared with adults without barriers to health care, adults who lack health insurance coverage, have coverage gaps, or skip or delay care because of limited personal finances might face increased risk for poor physical and mental health and premature mortality. Period Covered: 2014. Description of System: The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is an ongoing, state-based, landline- and cellular-telephone survey of noninstitutionalized adults aged =18 years residing in the United States. Data are collected from states, the District of Columbia, and participating U.S. territories on health risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, health care access, and use of clinical preventive services (CPS). An optional Health Care Access module was included in the 2014 BRFSS. This report summarizes 2014 BRFSS data from all 50 states and the District of Columbia on health care access and use of selected CPS recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force or the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices among working-aged adults (aged 18-64 years), by state, state Medicaid expansion status, expanded geographic region, and federal poverty level (FPL). This report also provides analysis of primary type of health insurance coverage at the time of interview, continuity of health insurance coverage during the preceding 12 months, and other health care access measures (i.e., unmet health care need because of cost, unmet prescription need because of cost, medical debt [medical bills being paid off over time], number of health care visits during the preceding year, and satisfaction with received health care) from 43 states that included questions from the optional BRFSS Health Care Access module. Results: In 2014, health insurance coverage and other health care access measures varied substantially by state, state Medicaid expansion status, expanded geographic region (i.e., states categorized geographically into nine regions), and FPL category. The following proportions refer to the range of estimated prevalence for health insurance and other health care access measures by examined geographical unit (unless otherwise specified), as reported by respondents. Among adults with health insurance coverage, the range was 70.8%-94.5% for states, 78.8%-94.5% for Medicaid expansion states, 70.8%-89.1% for nonexpansion states, 73.3%-91.0% for expanded geographic regions, and 64.2%-95.8% for FPL categories. Among adults who had a usual source of health care, the range was 57.2%-86.6% for states, 57.2%-86.6% for Medicaid expansion states, 61.8%-83.9% for nonexpansion states, 64.4%-83.6% for expanded geographic regions, and 61.0%-81.6% for FPL categories. Among adults who received a routine checkup, the range was 52.1%-75.5% for states, 56.0%-75.5% for Medicaid expansion states, 52.1%-71.1% for nonexpansion states, 56.8%-70.2% for expanded geographic regions, and 59.9%-69.2% for FPL categories. Among adults who had unmet health care need because of cost, the range was 8.0%-23.1% for states, 8.0%-21.9% for Medicaid expansion states, 11.9%-23.1% for nonexpansion states, 11.6%-20.3% for expanded geographic regions, and 5.3%-32.9% for FPL categories. Estimated prevalence of cancer screenings, influenza vaccination, and having ever been tested for human immunodeficiency virus also varied by state, state Medicaid expansion status, expanded geographic region, and FPL category. The prevalence of insurance coverage varied by approximately 25 percentage points among racial/ethnic groups (range: 63.9% among Hispanics to 88.4% among non-Hispanic Asians) and by approximately 32 percentage points by FPL category (range: 64.2% among adults with household income <100% of FPL to 95.8% among adults with household income >400% of FPL). The prevalence of unmet health care need because of cost varied by nearly 14 percentage points among racial/ethnic groups (range: 11.3% among non-Hispanic Asians to 25.0% among Hispanics), by approximately 17 percentage points among adults with and without disabilities (30.8% versus 13.7%), and by approximately 28 percentage points by FPL category (range: 5.3% among adults with household income >400% of FPL to 32.9% among adults with household income <100% of FPL). Among the 43 states that included questions from the optional module, a majority of adults reported private health insurance coverage (63.4%), followed by public health plan coverage (19.4%) and no primary source of insurance (17.1%). Financial barriers to health care (unmet health care need because of cost, unmet prescribed medication need because of cost, and medical bills being paid off over time [medical debt]) were typically lower among adults in Medicaid expansion states than those in nonexpansion states regardless of source of insurance. Approximately 75.6% of adults reported being continuously insured during the preceding 12 months, 12.9% reported a gap in coverage, and 11.5% reported being uninsured during the preceding 12 months. The largest proportion of adults reported =3 visits to a health care professional during the preceding 12 months (47.3%), followed by 1-2 visits (37.1%), and no health care visits (15.6%). Adults in expansion and nonexpansion states reported similar levels of satisfaction with received health care by primary source of health insurance coverage and by continuity of health insurance coverage during the preceding 12 months. Interpretation: This report presents for the first time estimates of population-based health care access and use of CPS among adults aged 18-64 years. The findings in this report indicate substantial variations in health insurance coverage other health care access measures; and use of CPS by state, state Medicaid expansion status, expanded geographic region, and FPL category. In 2014, health insurance coverage, having a usual source of care, having a routine checkup, and not experiencing unmet health care need because of cost were higher among adults living below the poverty level (i.e., household income <100% of FPL) in states that expanded Medicaid than in states that did not. Similarly, estimates of breast and cervical cancer screening and influenza vaccination were higher among adults living below the poverty level in states that expanded Medicaid than in states that did not. These disparities might be due to larger differences to begin with, decreased disparities in Medicaid expansion states versus nonexpansion states, or increased disparities in nonexpansion states. Public Health Action: BRFSS data from 2014 can be used as a baseline by which to assess and monitor changes that might occur after 2014 resulting from programs and policies designed to increase access to health care, reduce health disparities, and improve the health of the adult population. Post-2014 changes in health care access, such as source of health insurance coverage, attainment and continuity of coverage, financial barriers, preventive care services, and health outcomes, can be monitored using these baseline estimates."

Secondary data analysis was performed on 439 surveys. Respondents were aggregated by the geographic regions and neighborhoods where they live and by two community health centers where they receive care. Outcome measures included pragmatic and skill barrier indices adapted from the Barriers to Care Questionnaire (BCQ); the pragmatics index consists logistical barriers, including transportation and cost; the skills index is made up of items related to navigating the healthcare system, including communicating with physicians and completing paperwork. The results indicate that immigrant Latinos living in western Cincinnati and northern Hamilton County face significantly higher pragmatic barriers to care, while Latino immigrants going to a community health center in western Cincinnati have significantly fewer pragmatic and skill barriers than immigrants utilizing a nearby community health center. Because healthcare options for undocumented immigrants do not improve with the Affordable Care Act, community health centers will continue to serve as their primary source of care. This is particularly true in non-traditional migration areas, where immigrants tend to be isolated and lack resources. Efforts to improve access to healthcare for immigrant Latinos require place-based approaches that allow for targeted resources to improve care in these locations. This study helps to fill that need by identifying variation in barriers to care on multiple levels and offering strategies to alleviate these barriers. © 2016 W. Montague Cobb-NMA Health Institute"

Interoperability between Health Information Systems (HIS) such as Electronic Health Records (EHRs), Laboratory Information Systems (LIS), and health registries, maintained by various care providers (e.g., primary/specialty care, ED, inpatient hospital systems) and public health departments (e.g., IIS, formerly referred to as immunization registries) are required for full realization of healthcare reform, set forth by the Affordable Care Act [1], [2]. Pediatric immunization is mainly covered by the primary care providers, supplemented in certain circumstances by alternative settings such as the ED and hospitals. It is critical that updated immunization records of individual patients are available at the Point-Of-Care (POC), to help decide the need for an immunization, such as tetanus vaccination in trauma patients, and prevent over or under immunization. To provide up-to-date information about immunization administered to individual patients by all care providers, with a view to improve immunization coverage and reduce unnecessary and duplicate immunization, the Georgia Department of Public Health (DPH) created a population based IIS (Georgia Registry of Immunization Transactions and Services or GRITS) [3]. Children's Healthcare of Atlanta worked with the DPH to establish an interface between their EHR system and GRITS so that the updated immunization records could be accessed online within the EHR at POC. This online access could also be viewed as a golden opportunity to improve the Center for Disease Control (CDC) recommended Tetanus, Diphtheria and Pertussis (Tdap) coverage for the 11 to 19 year-old children, known to be difficult population to reach out to, to improve Tdap coverage targets. We compared the immunization coverage practices, based on CDC recommendations, in patients 10 to 20 years of age, presenting with trauma where tetanus immunization was indicated, pre-post availability of GRITS via EHR. At implementation onset, there was a significant increase in vaccination rates (2.3%, p=0.01), but, the increase was not sustained and the pre-implementation downward trend continued (p=0.91). There were only 4 patients who were seen more than once for trauma and ordered tetanus immunization (combined) twice; 2 patients before and 2 after the implementation. Both the pre-implementation patients were vaccinated twice, whereas only 1 patient was vaccinated twice in the post-implementation phase and the other patient's order was discontinued. While showing a short-term increase in ED based immunization post-implementation of GRITS, real time access to updated immunization records did not impact the overall long-term rates of updating Tdap immunization in the ED. As with many Quality Initiative (QI) efforts, improvements may be transient and further evaluation of GRITS and strategies to maintain the QI impact of this and other EHR systems are important. As suggested by some experts, providing appropriate interactive reminders and alerts at POC to reduce 'missed opportunities' to vaccinate during all patient encounters are needed to reach the 90% target of Tdap coverage by 2020 set forth by the government [4]. © 2016 IEEE."

Methods: Using the 2002-2011 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) data, our cross-sectional study analyzed 197 patient records - 79 patients with one record and 59 with two entries per patient (138 unique patients). We used three patient groups, based on international statistical classification of diseases version 9 code for condition (ICD9CODX) classification, to focus inference from the analysis: (a) non-dialysis dependent CKD, (b) dialysis and (c) transplant. Covariate information included region, demographic, co-morbid conditions and types of services. We used descriptive methods and multivariate generalized linear models to understand the impact of cost drivers. We compared actual and predicted CKD cost of care data using a hold-out sample of nine, randomly selected patients to validate the models. Results: Total costs were significantly affected by treatment type, with dialysis being significantly higher than non-dialysis and transplant groups. Costs were highest in the West region of the U.S. Average costs for patients with public insurance were significantly higher than patients with private insurance (p < .0743), and likewise, for patients with co-morbid conditions over those without co-morbid conditions (p < .001). Conclusions: Managing CKD patients both before and after the onset of dialysis treatment and managing co-morbid conditions in individuals with CKD are potential sources of substantial cost savings in the care of CKD patients. Comparing total costs pre and post the United States Affordable Care Act could provide invaluable insights into managing the cost-quality tradeoff in CKD care. © 2016 The Author(s)."

This has occurred mostly through charity care. This article examines how not-for-profit hospitals spent Community Benefit dollars prior to full implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). METHODS:: Using data from 2009 to 2012 hospital tax and other governmental filings, we constructed national, hospital-referral-region, and facility-level estimates of Community Benefit spending. Data were collected in 2015 and analyzed in 2015 and 2016. Data were matched at the facility level for a non-profit hospitalʼs IRS tax filings (Form 990, Schedule H) and CMS Hospital Cost Report Information System and Provider of Service data sets. RESULTS:: During 2009, hospitals spent about 8% of total operating expenses on Community Benefit. This increased to between 8.3% and 8.5% in 2012. The majority of spending (>80%) went toward charity care, unreimbursed Medicaid, and subsidized health services, with approximately 6% going toward both community health improvement and health professionalsʼ education. By 2012, national spending on Community Benefit likely exceeded $60 billion. The largest hospital systems spent the vast majority of the nationʼs Community Benefit; the top 25% of systems spent more than 80 cents of every Community Benefit dollar. DISCUSSION:: Community Benefit spending has remained relatively steady as a proportion of total operating expenses and so has increased over time—although charity care remains the major focus of Community Benefit spending overall. IMPLICATIONS:: More than $60 billion was spent on Community Benefit prior to implementation of the ACA. New reporting and spending requirements from the IRS, alongside changes by the ACA, are changing incentives for hospitals in how they spend Community Benefit dollars. In the short term, and especially the long term, hospital systems would do well to partner with public health, other social services, and even competing hospitals to invest in population-based activities. The mandated community health needs assessment process is a logical home for these sorts of collaborations. Relatively modest investments can improve the baseline level of health in their communities and make it easier to improve population health. Aside from a population health justification for a partnership model, a business case is necessary for widespread adoption of this approach. Because of their authorities, responsibilities, and centuries of expertise in community health, public health agencies are in a position to help hospitals form concrete, sustainable collaborations for the improvement of population health. CONCLUSION:: The ACA will likely change the delivery of uncompensated and charity care in the United States in the years to come. How hospitals choose to spend those dollars may be influenced greatly by the financial and political environments, as well as the strength of community partnerships.

Underinsurance is associated with reduced access to care, household debt, and bankruptcy but has been difficult to track without economic data. METHODS:: We used readily available state-level survey data to build a model that states can adopt to implement surveillance over underinsurance and health care-related financial burden, as well as assess related disparities and health profiles. RESULTS:: The state prevalence of underinsurance and dental uninsurance did not change in the first year of the ACAʼs individual mandate. Underinsurance was associated with poorer health-related quality-of-life measures: compared with the fully insured, underinsured adults had an adjusted odds ratio of 2.40 (95% CI, 1.71-3.38) of fair or poor general health. CONCLUSION:: Tracking underinsurance and medical debt can help public health and health care access stakeholders evaluate which mechanisms (deductibles, co-pays, uncovered services, or is proportionately priced health care services and products) are barriers to care and improved health outcomes.

Methods: This mixed-methods study was set in Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC). Qualitative interviews with 29 KPNC leaders explored planning for ACA implementation. Quantitative analyses compared newly enrolled HIV-positive patients in KPNC between January and December 2012 (""pre-ACA,"" N 661) with newly enrolled HIV-positive patients between January and December 2014 (""post-ACA,"" N 880) on demographics; medical, psychiatric, and substance use disorder diagnoses; HIV clinical indicators; and type of health care utilization. Results: Interviews found that ACA preparation focused on enrollment growth, staffing, competition among health plans, concern about cost sharing, and HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) services. Quantitative analyses found that post-ACA HIV-positive patient enrollment grew. New enrollees in 2014 were more likely than 2012 enrollees to be enrolled in high-deductible plans (P < 0.01) or through Medicaid (P < 0.01), and marginally more likely to have better HIV viral control (P < 0.10). They also were more likely to be diagnosed with asthma (P < 0.01) or substance use disorders (P < 0.05) and to have used primary care health services in the 6 months postenrollment (P < 0.05) than the pre-ACA cohort. Conclusions: As anticipated by KPNC interviewees, ACA implementation was followed by HIV-positive patient enrollment growth and changing benefit structures and patient characteristics. Although HIV viral control improved, comorbid diagnosis findings reinforced the importance of coordinated health care. © 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc."

American health care costs so much because we both overuse and overpay for health care goods and services. The Affordable Care Act's cost control policies focus on curbing overutilization by encouraging health care providers to integrate to promote efficiency and eliminate waste, but the cost control policies largely ignore prices. This article examines this overlooked half of health care cost control policy: rising prices and the policy levers held by the states to address them. We challenge the conventional wisdom that reducing overutilization through health care integration will effectively reduce health spending. We argue that vertical integration - bringing together disparate providers from hospitals to physicians - is a doubleedged sword, with not only the potential to reduce wasteful and unnecessary use of services but also downside risks of increasing market consolidation and health care prices. Due to already highly concentrated health care markets and the limits of federal antitrust enforcement of vertical health care integration, states have both an opportunity and an obligation to supplement federal antitrust efforts to control rising health care prices stemming from health care integration. The way to manage the double-edged sword of health care integration is to require price and quality oversight to avoid harm to competition. We offer a menu of six policy initiatives for states to choose from, ranging from data collection to rate regulation. If we are to control our personal and national health care spending, states have a critical role to play in overseeing health care integration and private health care price increases."

OBJECTIVE.: As an initial effort to address readmissions after lumbar discectomy, reasons for hospital readmission are identified and discussed. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA.: Lumbar discectomy is a commonly performed procedure. The Affordable Care Act codifies penalties for hospital readmissions. New quality-based reimbursements tied to readmissions call for a better understanding of the causes of readmission after procedures such as lumbar discectomy. METHODS.: Lumbar discectomies performed in 2012–2014 were identified in the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) database. Patient Demographics, surgical variables, and reasons for readmissions within 30 days were recorded. Pearsonʼs Chi Square was used to compare rates of demographics and surgical variables between readmitted and non-readmitted patients. Multivariate regression was used to identify risk factors for readmission. RESULTS.: Of 20,376 lumbar discectomies, 533 patients (2.62%) were readmitted within 30 days of surgery. The most common reasons for readmission were surgical site infections (n?=?130, 0.64% of all discectomies, 24.4% of all readmissions), followed by pain issues (n?=?89, 0.44%, 16.7%), and thromboembolic events (43, 0.21%, 8.1%). Overall time to readmission was 13.0 days?±?8.0 days (mean?±?standard deviation). Factors most associated with readmission after lumbar discectomy were higher ASA class (Relative risk [RR]?=?1.49, p?<?0.001) and prolonged operative time (RR?=?1.41, p?=?0.002). CONCLUSIONS.: Surgical site infection, postoperative pain, and thromboembolic events were the most common reasons for readmission after lumbar discectomy. These findings identify potential areas for quality improvement initiatives. Copyright © 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved."

Using cross-sectional and panel survey data, the findings reveal that healthcare attitudes are responsive to information that individuals receive through personal experience. Individuals who experienced a positive change in their insurance situation are found to express more positive views toward the health reform law, while individuals who lost their insurance or experienced an otherwise negative personal impact on their insurance situations express more negative views. The results point to personal experience as a source of information that can influence individuals’ preferences. However, although attitudes are responsive to the quality of one’s personal interactions with the healthcare system, the results also suggest that partisan bias is still at work. Republicans are more likely to blame the health reform law for negative changes in their health insurance situations, while Democrats are more likely to credit the law for positive changes in their situations. These motivated attributions for their personal situations temper how responsive partisans’ attitudes are to information acquired through personal experience. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York."

Efforts to increase insurance coverage, including passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), were intended to improve access to care and promote improvements in outcomes. However, despite reported gains in coverage, the ACA's success in promoting use of high-quality care and enacting changes in clinical end points remains unclear. Objectives: To assess for observed changes in insurance coverage and rehabilitation use among young adult trauma patients associated with the ACA, including the Dependent Coverage Provision (DCP) and Medicaid expansion/open enrollment, and to consider possible insurance and rehabilitation differences between DCP-eligible vs - ineligible patients and among stratified demographic and community subgroups. Design, Setting, and Participants: A longitudinal assessment of DCP implementation and Medicaid expansion/open enrollment using risk-adjusted before-and-after, difference-in-difference, and interrupted time-series analyses was conducted. Eleven years (January 1, 2005, to September 31, 2015) of Maryland Health Services Cost Review Commission data, representing complete patient records from all payers within the state, were used to identify all hospitalized young adult (aged 18-34 years) trauma patients in Maryland during the study period. Results: Of the 69 507 hospitalized patients included, 50 548 (72.7%) were male, and the mean (SD) age was 25 (5) years. Before implementation of the DCP, 1 of 4 patients was uninsured. After ACA implementation, the number fell to less than 1 of 10, with similar patterns emerging in emergency department and outpatient settings. The change was primarily driven by Medicaid expansion/open enrollment, which corresponded to a 20.1 percentage-point increase in Medicaid (95% CI, 18.9-21.3) and an 18.2 percentage-point decrease in uninsured (95% CI, -19.3 to -17.2). No changes were detected among privately insured patients. Rehabilitation use increased by 5.4 percentage points (95% CI, 4.5-6.2)-a 60% relative increase from a baseline of 9%. Mortality (-0.5; 95% CI, -0.9 to -0.1) and failure-to-rescue rates (-4.5; 95% CI, -7.4 to -1.6) also significantly declined. Stratified changes point to significant differences in the percentage of uninsured patients and rehabilitation access across the board, mitigating or even eradicating disparities in certain cases. Conclusions and Relevance: For patients who are injured, young, and uninsured, Medicaid expansion/open enrollment in Maryland changed insurance coverage and altered patient outcomes in ways that the DCP alone was never intended to do. Implementation of Medicaid expansion/open enrollment transformed the landscape of trauma coverage, directly affecting the health of one of the country's most vulnerable at-risk groups.

This comprehensive health care reform legislation sought to expand health care coverage to millions of Americans, control health care costs, and improve the overall quality of the health care system. The ACA required that all US citizens and legal residents have qualifying health insurance by 2014. In this paper we give readers a brief overview of the effects of the ACA based on recent research. We then turn our attention to the possibility of using the ACA expansion to answer important underlying questions, such as: To what extent does the holding of insurance lead to improvements in access to care? To what extent does the holding of coverage lead to improvements in health? In mental health? Are there likely general equilibrium effects on labor force participation, hours worked, employment setting, and indeed even the probability of marrying? By necessity, researchers' ability to answer these questions depends on the availability of data, so we discuss current and potential data sources relevant for answering these questions. We also look to what has been studied about the health reform in Massachusetts and early Medicaid expansions to speculate what we can expect to learn about the effects of the ACA on these outcomes in the future."

As a result, hospitals must now do more than provide charity care to their patients in exchange for the benefits of tax exemption. The CHNA requirement has the potential both to prompt a radical change in hospitals' relationship to their communities and to enlist hospitals as meaningful contributors to community health improvement initiatives. Final regulations issued in December 2014 clarify hospitals' obligations under the CHNA requirement, but could do more to facilitate hospitals' engagement in collaborative community health projects. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has a rich opportunity, while hospitals are still learning to conduct CHNAs, to develop guidance establishing clear but flexible expectations for how providers should assess and address community needs. This Article urges the IRS to seize that opportunity by refining its regulatory framework for the CHNA requirement. Specifically, the IRS should more robustly promote transparency, accountability, community engagement, and collaboration while simultaneously leaving hospitals a good degree of flexibility. By promoting alignment between hospitals' regulatory compliance activities and broader community health improvement initiatives, the IRS could play a meaningful role in efforts to reorient our system towards promoting health and not simply treating illness."

Methods Our sample consisted of 36,802 young adults aged 19–25 years from 2011 to 2014 National Health Interview Survey. Sociodemographic differences among young adults with the four insurance types were described: privately insured under parents, privately insured under self/spouse, publicly insured, and uninsured. Multivariable logistic models were fitted to compare those covered under parent with those covered through other traditional insurance types, in terms of the following outcomes: health status, health behaviors, insurance history and experience, access to care, care utilization, and receipt of preventive service, controlling for sociodemographic factors. Results Young adults who were covered under their parents' insurance were most likely to be college students and non-Hispanic whites. These young adults also had more stable insurance, better access to care, better care utilization patterns, and reported better health status, compared to their peers. Conclusions The beneficiaries of the ACA-dependent coverage expansion were more likely to be college students from families with high socioeconomic status. Coverage under parents was associated with improved access to care and health outcomes among young adults. The enrollees through the ACA represent the healthiest subgroup of young adults and those with the best care utilization patterns, suggesting that the added cost relative to premium for insurers from this population will likely be minimal. © 2016 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine"

The expansion of coverage for smoking cessation therapy with no out-of-pocket cost could reduce Medicaid expenditures in all 3 states. © 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc."

But what is the state of core medical relationships in the wake of these changes? Throughout ACA-era health care reform, the doctor–patient relationship was targeted as a particularly important focus for improving communication and health outcomes. Recent developments however have shifted the focus from individual-level outcomes to the wellbeing of populations. This, we argue, requires a fundamental rethinking of health care reform as an opportunity to renegotiate relationships. For example, the move to population medicine requires that the very concept of a patient be resituated and the scope of relevant relationships expanded. Medical relationships in this era of health care are likely to include partnerships between various types of clinicians and the communities in which patients reside, as well as a host of new actors, from social workers and navigators to scribes and community health workers. To address the upstream determinants of population health, providers must be increasingly willing and trained to collaborate with community stakeholders to address both medical and non-medical issues. These community-based partnerships are critical to providing health care that is both relevant and appropriate for addressing problems, and sustainable. Approaching health care reform, and the focus on population health, as a fundamental reworking of relationships provides scholars with a sharper theoretical lens for understanding 21st century American health care. © 2016 The Authors"

To accomplish this goal, the Department of Health and Human Services is designing and implementing new payment models intended to improve the quality of health care while reducing its cost. Collectively, these novel payment models and programs have been characterized under the moniker of value-based purchasing (VBP), and although many of these models retain a fundamental fee-for-service (FFS) structure, they are seen as essential tools in the evolution away from volume-based health care financing toward a health system that provides “better care, smarter spending, and healthier people.” In 2014, approximately 20% of Medicare provider FFS payments were linked to a VBP program. The Department of Health and Human Services has committed to a four-year plan to link 90% of Medicare provider FFS payments to value-based purchasing by 2018. To achieve this goal, all items and services currently reimbursed under Medicare FFS programs will need to be evaluated in the context of VBP. To this end, the Medicare Hospice benefit appears to be appropriate for inclusion in a model of VBP. This policy analysis proposes an adaptable model for a VBP program for the Medicare Hospice benefit linking payment to quality and efficiency in a manner consistent with statutory requirements established in the Affordable Care Act. © 2016 American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine"

Approximately 10 years ago, the 2006 Tax Relief and Health Care Act established the Physician Quality Reporting System and eligible providers were given an opportunity to earn incentives by successfully reporting quality metrics. The Affordable Care Act brought important refinements to PQRS, including the introduction of negative adjustments for nonparticipation. The MACRA recognized that one of the challenges facing practitioners was the disparate nature of the various CMS programs designed to facilitate quality of care and measure resource use. Going forward, these metrics will be aggregated into a single numeric score, which may be attractive to providers.

Expenditures were self-reported payments for premiums, coinsurance, deductibles, and health services and supplies not covered by health insurance. The burden was measured as a ratio of total medical expenditures relative to family income. Supported by literature, several cutoffs (as opposed to just one threshold) were proposed to determine the critical point of increased health risk of medical financial burden. A treatment effects model was estimated recognizing that ratios are jointly influenced by other confounding factors such as chronic conditions. Data on 16,907 adults in the 2011 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey were analyzed. The researchers concluded that ratios exceeding 10% increased the probability of reporting poor or fair health status. However, estimating this relationship while accounting for insurance but ignoring the presence of chronic conditions completely reversed this relationship.

The objectives of this study were to examine the types of physicians sought by women beyond their customary reproductive years and before being elderly. Methods: This retrospective cohort study involved an analysis of national data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) between 2002 and 2012. Women between 45 and 64 years old (n = 44,830) were interviewed, and reviews of corresponding office visits (n = 330,114) were undertaken. Results: In 2002, women aged 45-64 years (62%) went to a family or internal medicine physician only and this reached 72% in 2012. The percentage of women who went to an obstetrician-gynecologist (ob-gyn) only decreased from 20% in 2002 to 12% in 2012. Most went to a family physician or general internist for a general checkup or for diagnosis or treatment. By contrast, visits to ob-gyn physicians were predominantly for general checkups. Those who went to an ob-gyn office were more likely to have a higher family income, live in the Northeast, and describe their overall health as being excellent. Conclusions: Women aged 45-64 years were substantially more likely to obtain care exclusively at offices of family physicians or general internists than of ob-gyn physicians.

The present effort describes a payer-provider patient registry for behavioral health home service. STUDY DESIGN: An observational study design was used to describe characteristics of individuals identified by the payer-provider patient registry. METHODS: In Pennsylvania, behavioral health agencies serve as health homes, with support by a behavioral health managed care organization (BHMCO) in the absence of a state waiver for health homes. The BHMCO initiates a priority patient registry monthly based on diagnoses for serious mental illness (SMI) and at least 1 chronic physical health condition. Providers contribute health data through a secure Web-based portal that become part of the registry and identify new participants. RESULTS: We identified 3759 individuals in the priority patient registry; 91% were identified by the payer. Most commonly, individuals with SMI were identified with hypertension (39%), asthma/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (27%), hyperlipidemia (20%), and diabetes (18%). Annual behavioral health Medicaid expenditures for individuals in the 12 months prior to appearing on the registry averaged $ 14, 685 per individual. Twelve percent of registry participants had annual behavioral health care expenditures over $ 25, 000. CONCLUSIONS: The use of claims data and health assessment information can identify individuals presenting with complex healthcare needs that may benefit from behavioral health home service."

OBJECTIVE: To characterize the impact of state Medicaid expansion status under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) on payer mix, length of stay (LOS), and in-hospital mortality. DESIGN/SETTING/PATIENTS: Retrospective cohort study of general medicine patients discharged from academic medical centers (AMCs) within the University HealthSystem Consortium from October 1, 2012 to September 30, 2015. INTERVENTION/MEASUREMENTS: Hospitals were stratified according to state Medicaid expansion status. The proportion of discharges by primary payer, LOS index, and mortality index were compared between Medicaid-expansion and nonexpansion hospitals before and after ACA implementation. ACA implementation was defined as January 1, 2014, for all states except Michigan, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, and Indiana, which had unique dates of Medicaid expansion. RESULTS: We identified 3,144,488 discharges from 156 hospitals in 24 Medicaid-expansion states and Washington, DC, and 1,114,464 discharges from 55 hospitals in 14 nonexpansion states during the study period. Hospitals in Medicaid-expansion states experienced a significant 3.7% increase in Medicaid discharges (P = 0.013) and a 2.9% decrease in uninsured discharges (P < 0.001) after ACA implementation, whereas hospitals in nonexpansion states saw no significant change in payer mix. In a difference-in-differences analysis, the changes in LOS and mortality indices pre- to post-ACA implementation did not differ significantly between hospitals in Medicaid-expansion versus nonexpansion states.

However, roughly half of justice-involved individuals were estimated to be newly eligible for health insurance through the Affordable Care Act (ACA). OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess health insurance trends among justice-involved individuals before and after implementation of the ACA’s key provisions, the dependent coverage mandate and Medicaid expansion, and to examine the relationship between health insurance and treatment for behavioral health conditions. DESIGN: Repeated and pooled cross-sectional analyses of data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH). PARTICIPANTS: Nationally representative sample of 15,899 adults age 19–64 years between 2008 and 2014 with a history of justice involvement during the prior 12 months. MAIN MEASURES: Uninsurance rates between 2008 and 2014 are reported. Additional outcomes include adjusted treatment rates for depression, serious mental illness, and SUD by insurance status. KEY RESULTS: The dependent coverage mandate was associated with a 13.0 percentage point decline in uninsurance among justice-involved individuals age 19–25 years (p < 0.001). Following Medicaid expansion, uninsurance declined among justice involved individuals of all ages by 9.7 percentage points (p < 0.001), but remained 16.3 percentage points higher than uninsurance rates for individuals without justice involvement (p < 0.001). In pooled analyses, Medicaid, relative to uninsurance and private insurance, was associated with significantly higher treatment rates for illicit drug abuse/dependence and depression. CONCLUSION: Given the high prevalence of mental illness and substance use disorders among justice-involved populations, persistently elevated rates of uninsurance and other barriers to care remain a significant public health concern. Sustained outreach is required to reduce health insurance disparities between individuals with and without justice involvement.

Lack of insurance coverage has been associated with more advanced disease at presentation, more emergent admissions at time of colectomy, and lower survival relative to privately insured patients. The 2006 Massachusetts health care reform serves as a unique natural experiment to assess the impact of insurance expansion on colorectal cancer care. Methods: We used the Hospital Cost and Utilization Project State Inpatient Databases to identify patients with colorectal cancer with government-subsidized or self-pay (GSSP) or private insurance admitted to a hospital between 2001 and 2011 in Massachusetts (n = 17,499) and three control states (n = 144,253). Difference-in-differences models assessed the impact of the 2006 Massachusetts coverage expansion on resection of colorectal cancer, controlling for confounding factors and secular trends. Results: Before the 2006 Massachusetts reform, government-subsidized or self-pay patients had significantly lower rates of resection for colorectal cancer compared with privately insured patients in both Massachusetts and the control states. The Massachusetts insurance expansion was associated with a 44% increased rate of resection (rate ratio = 1.44; 95% CI, 1.23 to 1.68; P < .001), a 6.21 percentage point decreased probability of emergent admission (95% CI, -11.88 to -0.54; P = .032), and an 8.13 percentage point increased probability of an elective admission (95% CI, 1.34 to 14.91; P = .019) compared with the control states. Conclusion: The 2006 Massachusetts health care reform, a model for the Affordable Care Act, was associated with increased rates of resection and decreased probability of emergent resection for colorectal cancer.

We aimed to assess differences in medical resource utilization, drug therapy, and health outcomes among RA patients by insurance type in the United States. Methods: Individuals with a self-reported diagnosis of RA were identified in the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) database, 2006–2009. Data regarding sociodemographic characteristics, insurance type and status, and outcomes (including health care resource utilization, prescription medication use, health status, and patient-reported barriers to health care) were extracted.

Accordingly, the emergence and routine use of real-world institutional registries have been vital to the longitudinal assessment of quality. However, prospectively obtaining longitudinal outcomes for patients at 24 months after spine surgery remains a challenge. The aim of this study was to assess if 12-month measures of treatment effectiveness accurately predict long-term outcomes (24 months). METHODS A nationwide, multiinstitutional, prospective spine outcomes registry was used for this study. Enrollment criteria included available demographic, surgical, and clinical outcomes data. All patients had prospectively collected outcomes measures and a minimum 2-year follow-up. Patient-reported outcomes instruments (Oswestry Disability Index [ODI], SF-36, and visual analog scale [VAS]-back pain/leg pain) were completed before surgery and then at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after surgery. The Health Transition Index of the SF-36 was used to determine the 1- and 2-year minimum clinically important difference (MCID), and logistic regression modeling was performed to determine if achieving MCID at 1 year adequately predicted improvement and achievement of MCID at 24 months. RESULTS The study group included 969 patients: 300 patients underwent anterior lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF), 606 patients underwent transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF), and 63 patients underwent lateral interbody fusion (LLIF). There was a significant correlation between the 12- and 24-month ODI (r = 0.82; p < 0.0001), SF-36 Physical Component Summary score (r = 0.89; p < 0.0001), VAS-back pain (r = 0.90; p < 0.0001), and VAS-leg pain (r = 0.85; p < 0.0001). For the ALIF cohort, patients achieving MCID thresholds for ODI at 12 months were 13-fold (p < 0.0001) more likely to achieve MCID at 24 months. Similarly, for the TLIF and LLIF cohorts, patients achieving MCID thresholds for ODI at 12 months were 13-fold and 14-fold (p < 0.0001) more likely to achieve MCID at 24 months. Outcome measures obtained at 12 months postoperatively are highly predictive of 24-month outcomes, independent of the surgical procedure. CONCLUSIONS In a multiinstitutional prospective study, patient-centered measures of surgical effectiveness obtained at 12 months adequately predict long-term (24-month) outcomes after lumbar spine surgery. Patients achieving MCID at 1 year were more likely to report meaningful and durable improvement at 24 months, suggesting that the 12-month time point is sufficient to identify effective versus ineffective patient care."

The goal of this study was to assess available databases and present accurate data on the current otolaryngology workforce, examine methods for prediction of future health care needs, and explore potential issues with forecasting methods and policy implementation based on these predictions. Study Design: Retrospective analysis of research databases, public use files, and claims data. Methods: The total number of otolaryngologists and current practices in the United States was tabulated using the databases of the American Academy of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery, American Medical Association, American Board of Otolaryngology, American College of Surgeons, Association of American Medical Colleges, National Center for Health Statistics, and Department of Health and Human Services. Otolaryngologists were identified as surgeons and classified into surgical groups using a combination of AMA primary and secondary self-reported specialties and American Board of Medical Specialties certifications. Data gathered were cross-referenced to rule out duplications to assess total practicing otolaryngologists. Data analyzed included type of practice: 1) academic versus private and 2) general versus specialty; and demographics: 1) urban versus rural, 2) patient age, 3) reason for visit (referral, new, established, surgical follow-up), 4) reason for visit (diagnosis), and 5) payer type. Results: Analysis from the above resources estimates the total number of otolaryngologists practicing in the United States in 2011 to be 12,609, with approximately 10,522 fully trained practicing physicians (9,232–10,654) and 2,087 in training (1,318 residents and 769 fellows/others). Based on 2011 data, workforce projections would place the fully trained and practicing otolaryngology workforce at 11,088 in 2015 and 12,084 in 2025 unless changes in training occur. The AAO-HNS Physicians Resource Committee performed an extensive analysis of collated data from multiple sources in 2014 and identified 10,800 practicing otolaryngologists and 2,087 in training. It is estimated that the current attrition rate is approximately 306 otolaryngologists per year. Percentage distribution of office visits by patient age was found to be 20% <15 years old, 7% 15 to 24 years old, 21% 25 to 44 years old, 32% 45 to 64 years old, 11% 65 to 74 years old, and 10% ≥75 years old. Reason for visit was 34% new, 29% chronic, 17% chronic with exacerbation, and 15% pre- or postsurgical follow-up. The top diagnoses consisted of otitis media, chronic sinusitis, and impacted cerumen. Payer mix consisted of 59% private insurance, 19% Medicare, and 12% Medicaid/Children's Health Insurance Program. Conclusions: Despite past findings and predictions of 8,000 to 8,500 otolaryngologists practicing in the United States, collated data from above resources places the total at 12,887, with 10,800 fully trained and practicing in 2014. This 30% to 50% underestimation of the otolaryngology workforce has an impact on future predictions and resource utilization analysis. Even when this correction is considered, the available trained otolaryngologists required to serve the otolaryngologic health care needs of the US population are still insufficient and understaffed. The impact of an aging population and the estimated 30 to 47 million newly insured citizens under the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act are also unprecedented variables that must be considered. Further analysis of differences in physician productivity and geographic population density, and model formation of current otolaryngology workforce utilization, are needed to predict future public health needs.

SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA.: Limited studies have been conducted to examine the issue of patient access to spine surgeons based on different insurance types (Medicaid vs. a specific private insurance), especially in relation to the Medicaid expansion that resulted from the Affordable Care Act. METHODS.: Appointment success rates, the need for a referral, and waiting periods were compared between Medicaid and a specific private insurance for patients needing an evaluation for a herniated lumbar disc. The waiting period was studied in the context of comparing states that have expanded Medicaid eligibility to ones that have not, and the surgical training of the spine surgeon (orthopaedic surgeons vs. neurosurgeons). RESULTS.: Appointment success rate for patients seeking access to lumbar spine care was significantly higher for patients with BlueCross insurance (95.0%) vs. patients with Medicaid insurance (0.8%) (p?<?0.001). The need for referrals was significantly higher for patients with Medicaid insurance (93.3%) vs. patients with BlueCross insurance (4.2%) (p?<?0.001). Among BlueCross patients, wait times were longer in Medicaid-expanded states. However, the same trend was not seen among patients with Medicaid insurance. CONCLUSIONS.: Patients with Medicaid were less successful at scheduling an appointment and faced more barriers to care, such as the need for a referral, compared to the private insurance studied. In the states with expanded Medicaid, wait times for appointments were longer for BlueCross patients, but were not longer for patients with Medicaid insurance. Overall, this study suggests that increased coverage resulting from Medicaid expansion does not necessarily equate to increased access to care.Level of Evidence: 2 Copyright © 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Prior research has addressed the performance of these markets, individually, without specifically quantifying the extent to which they are linked. Increasing levels of health insurance losses could increase the scale of potential malpractice claims, boosting medical malpractice losses, or could embody an improvement in medical care quality, which will reduce malpractice losses. Our results for a state panel data set from 2002 to 2009 demonstrate that health insurance losses are negatively related to medical malpractice insurance losses. An additional dollar of health insurance losses is associated with a $0.01–$0.05 reduction in medical malpractice losses.

Updated, detailed, nationally representative data describing adverse drug events can help focus these efforts. OBJECTIVE To describe the characteristics of emergency department (ED) visits for adverse drug events in the United States in 2013-2014 and describe changes in ED visits for adverse drug events since 2005-2006. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Active, nationally representative, public health surveillance in 58 EDs located in the United States and participating in the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System-Cooperative Adverse Drug Event Surveillance project. EXPOSURES Drugs implicated in ED visits. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Nationalweighted estimates of ED visits and subsequent hospitalizations for adverse drug events. RESULTS Based on data from 42 585 cases, an estimated 4.0 (95%CI, 3.1-5.0) ED visits for adverse drug events occurred per 1000 individuals annually in 2013 and 2014 and 27.3% (95%CI, 22.2%-32.4%) of ED visits for adverse drug events resulted in hospitalization. An estimated 34.5%(95%CI, 30.3%-38.8%) of ED visits for adverse drug events occurred among adults aged 65 years or older in 2013-2014 compared with an estimated 25.6%(95% CI, 21.1%-30.0%) in 2005-2006; older adults experienced the highest hospitalization rates (43.6%; 95%CI, 36.6%-50.5%). Anticoagulants, antibiotics, and diabetes agents were implicated in an estimated 46.9%(95%CI, 44.2%-49.7%) of ED visits for adverse drug events, which included clinically significant adverse events, such as hemorrhage (anticoagulants), moderate to severe allergic reactions (antibiotics), and hypoglycemia with moderate to severe neurological effects (diabetes agents). Since 2005-2006, the proportions of ED visits for adverse drug events from anticoagulants and diabetes agents have increased, whereas the proportion from antibiotics has decreased. Among children aged 5 years or younger, antibiotics were the most common drug class implicated (56.4%; 95%CI, 51.8%-61.0%). Among children and adolescents aged 6 to 19 years, antibiotics also were the most common drug class implicated (31.8%; 95%CI, 28.7%-34.9%) in ED visits for adverse drug events, followed by antipsychotics (4.5%; 95%CI, 3.3%-5.6%). Among older adults (aged≥65 years), 3 drug classes (anticoagulants, diabetes agents, and opioid analgesics) were implicated in an estimated 59.9%(95%CI, 56.8%-62.9%) of ED visits for adverse drug events; 4 anticoagulants (warfarin, rivaroxaban, dabigatran, and enoxaparin) and 5 diabetes agents (insulin and 4 oral agents) were among the 15 most common drugs implicated. Medications to always avoid in older adults according to Beers criteria were implicated in 1.8%(95%CI, 1.5%-2.1%) of ED visits for adverse drug events. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The prevalence of emergency department visits for adverse drug events in the United States was estimated to be 4 per 1000 individuals in 2013 and 2014.

Hospital administrative data from 201 non-federal Illinois hospitals for patients age 18–64 were used to analyze ED visits and hospitalizations through the ED. ACSH was defined using Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Prevention Quality Indicators (PQIs). Logistic regression was used to test the effect of time period on the odds of an ACSH for uninsured Illinois residents, controlling for patient sociodemographic characteristics, weekend visits and state region. Total ED visits increased 5.6% in Illinois after ACA implementation, with virtually no change in hospital admissions. Uninsured ED visits declined from 22.9% of all visits pre-ACA to 12.5% in 2014–2015, reflecting a 43% decline in average monthly ED visits and 54% in ED hospitalizations. The proportion of uninsured ED hospitalizations classified as ACSH increased from 15.4 to 15.5%, a non-significant difference. Older uninsured female, minority and downstate Illinois patients remained significantly more likely to experience ACSH throughout the study period. ED visits for the uninsured declined dramatically after ACA implementation in Illinois but over 12% of ED visits are for the remaining uninsured. The proportion of visits resulting in ACSH remained stable. Providing universal insurance with care coordination focused on improved access to home and ambulatory care could be highly cost effective. © 2016 Springer Science+Business Media New York"

Those seeking health insurance struggle to understand insurance options and choose a plan that best suits their needs. Methods: We interviewed stakeholders to identify the challenges associated with the ACA Marketplace health insurance enrollment and elicited feedback about what to include in health insurance decision support tools. Interviews were transcribed and themes were identified using inductive thematic analysis. Results: Stakeholders stated that consumers felt frustrated by unclear terminology, high plan costs, and complex calculations required to assess costs. Consumers felt anxious about making the wrong choice and being unable to change plans within a calendar year. Stakeholders recommended using plain language tables defining complex terms, grouping information, and using engaging graphics to communicate information about health insurance. Stakeholders thought that narratives of how others made decisions about insurance might be helpful to consumers, but recommended that they be tailored to the needs of specific consumers. Conclusion: Strategies that clarify health insurance terms using plain language and graphics, acknowledge concern associated with making the wrong choice, calculate and enable cost comparison, and tailor information to consumers' unique needs could benefit those enrolling in ACA Marketplace plans, Narratives developed should be simple and inclusive enough for diverse populations. © 2016 The Author(s)."

Design Cross-sectional, descriptive survey. Setting New Mexico. Participants Women's health providers in New Mexico, including nurse practitioners, certified nurse-midwives, and family practice and obstetrician-gynecologist physicians. Methods Participants completed a self-administered survey to measure knowledge, attitudes, external barriers, and adherence to each of the eight guidelines. Adherence was defined as following a guideline more than 90% of the time. Results The response rate was 22% (399/1,798). Among the eight guidelines, participant adherence ranged from 17.2% to 88.4%. Only 39.7% of participants indicated adherence to most of the guidelines (four or more). Overall, provider adherence was directly associated with familiarity with the guidelines (odds ratio = 3.69; 95% confidence interval [1.96, 6.96]), self-efficacy to implement them (odds ratio = 4.25; 95% confidence interval [2.21, 8.20]), and younger age (odds ratio = 0.97; 95% confidence interval [0.94, 1.00]).

Methods We identified diabetes (n = 1,022,588) and CVD (n = 1,187,035) patients receiving primary care between October 2013 and September 2014 in 130 Veterans Affairs facilities. We compared glycemic control (hemoglobin A1c < 7%) in diabetic patients, blood pressure (BP) < 140/90 mmHg in diabetic or CVD patients, cholesterol control (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol < 100 mg/dL, receiving a statin) in diabetic or CVD patients, and those receiving a β-blocker (with history of myocardial infarction in the last 2 years) among patients receiving care from physicians and APPs. We also compared the proportion meeting composite measure (glycemic, BP, and cholesterol control in diabetic patients; BP, cholesterol control, and receipt of β-blocker among eligible CVD patients). Results Diabetic patients receiving care from APPs were statistically more likely to have glycemic (50% vs 51.4%, odds ratio [OR] 1.06 [1.05-1.08]) and BP control (77.5% vs 78.4%, OR 1.04 [1.03-1.06]), whereas patients receiving care from physicians were more likely to have cholesterol control (receipt of statin 68% vs 66.5%, OR 0.94 [0.93-0.95]) in adjusted models, although these differences are not clinically significant. Similar results were seen in CVD patients. Few patients met the composite measure (27.1% and 27.6% of diabetic and 54.0% and 54.8% of CVD patients receiving care from physicians and APPs, respectively). Conclusions Diabetes and CVD care quality was comparable between physicians and APPs with clinically insignificant differences. Regardless of provider type, there is a need to improve performance on eligible measures in diabetes or CVD patients. © 2016"

With an analysis spanning more than 50 years, it first traces the pressures for reform that created the Declaration more than 50 years ago, demonstrating that American bishops were crucial actors in the Declaration’s existence and passage, and that this was the case because of the strong legitimacy pressures they were under as Roman Catholic leaders in a predominantly Protestant country. The paper then turns to a summary of how the Birth Control Mandate of the Affordable Care Act once again created pressures for legitimacy for the American Catholic hierarchy, pressures which were again articulated in terms of critiques of hypocrisy. It demonstrates that although the specific critique changed, accusations of hypocrisy remain central in discussions of the Catholic Church’s stance on the Birth Control Mandate in the Affordable Care Act. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."

Recent implementation of the 2010 Affordable Care Act (ACA) has increased access to health insurance for young adults, in part by maintaining health coverage through their parents until age 26. This paper examines patterns of Latino young adults' insurance coverage during early ACA implementation by addressing three questions: 1) To what extent do Latino young adults remain uninsured relative to their peers of other ethnoracial groups? 2) How do young adults' family socioeconomic background, immigrant characteristics, college enrollment, and employment status mediate their coverage? And, 3) do patterns of insurance coverage differ for employer-provided coverage versus other sources of coverage (including parents’ health insurance)? Using a 2011 representative sample of U.S.-born and 1.5-generation immigrant young adults in California, we find that Latinos are more likely than other ethnoracial groups to remain uninsured. While they are as likely as similar peers to obtain employer-provided health insurance, they are less likely to possess insurance through other sources (including their parents). This study contributes to our understanding of the limits of the ACA in reducing disparities in insurance coverage for Latinos by highlighting the importance of family socioeconomic background, immigrant characteristics, college enrollment, and employment in shaping coverage among this age group. © 2016"

We aimed to evaluate Rhode Island residents' experiences with cost-related access challenges within the state's healthcare system. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of resident experiences with healthcare in Rhode Island. Our survey instrument was composed of the RAND Corporation ""Short-Form Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire (PSQ-18)"", questions developed by the Rhode Island Office of the Health Insurance Commissioner, and ranking of health priorities based on prior community assessments conducted by the Rhode Island Department of Health. Data were collected at venues across the state as part of the Rhode Island Department of Health 2015 Statewide Health Inventory. From July to August 2015, 404 surveys were completed. We found that 40% of respondents had a co-pay of $20-$50, while 35.7% of respondents had a deductible of greater than $500. Further, one-third of respondents delayed receiving care due to financial barriers. This decision resulted in a worsening condition or hospital visit for nearly half of those respondents. Co-pays and deductibles pose challenges to Rhode Islanders accessing health care. Cost-related barriers to healthcare access should continue to be addressed, especially in the context of preventive care services, which are now being built into health insurance premiums through the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.

Johnson’s great society. It has been claimed that many of the law’s reforms are now so integrated in the health system that full repeal would be impractical, while others including President Elect Trump have rejected that idea and called for full repeal and replacement claiming ACA law cannot be fixed. A tsunami of increasing regulatory burden over the past 8 years, the current health care milieu has moved independent practitioners towards hospital employment in great numbers. In addition, public opinion has been slowly climbing against ObamaCare with 54% of Americans now opposing the law. President Obama has indicated that the law has accomplished many of its goals, including increasing accessibility, affordability, and quality of health care. However, others have contradicted these assertions and described the ACA as “insurance for many with coverage for few.” Some believe that the ACA might be more appropriately labeled the “Medicaid Expansion Act.” There are multiple plans developed over the years by republican members of the congress; however, of significant consequence and importance are President-elect Trump’s proposals and the plan developed by Speaker Paul Ryan to repeal and replace the ACA. The President-elect has described the problems he perceives with the ACA; rapidly rising premiums and deductibles, narrow networks, and limits of coverage imposed by health insurance companies. The Presidentelect has indicated that his goal will be to create a patient-centered health care system that promotes choice, quality, and affordability with health insurance and health care, and take any needed action to alleviate the burdens imposed on American families and businesses by law. © 2016, American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians.

As such, health systems optimize value by providing the most cost-effective care possible without sacrificing safety or outcomes. Elective, minimal risk surgical procedures in children may be value-enhanced by moving from an operating room (OR) to a more cost-efficient setting. The purpose of this study was to assess the safety and cost of performing the removal of implantable central venous access devices (“ports”) in locations other than the main OR. Methods We compared port removal at three sites: 1. Main OR, 2. Satellite OR, and 3. Clinic Procedure Room. This was a mixed-methods study including a retrospective review of medical records and prospective observation/interviewing. To calculate cost without the inherent biases of hospital charges, costs, and payments, we utilized the methodology of time-driven activity based costing. Specifically, we recorded time spent by the patient in hospital facilities and with health care personnel. This duration was then weighted with the hourly cost of each health care professional and hospital space. The Mann–Whitney U test compared time and cost across the three sites. Overall cost at each site was divided by overall cost at the referent site (Main OR) to obtain a ratio of cost savings. Results A total of 120 patients (40 per site) were included in the analysis. Demographic and clinical factors were not significantly different between sites. No complication occurred with port removal at any site. Time of the entire care episode was significantly decreased in the Clinic (median 161 min, 95% confidence interval [CI] 134–188 min), compared to the Main OR (median 235 min, 95% confidence interval [CI] 209–251 min) or Satellite OR (median 228 min, 95% confidence interval [CI] 211–245 min). Overall cost was decreased by 25% (95% CI: 13–34%) at the Clinic and by 6% (95% CI: − 2–11%) at the Satellite OR, compared to the Main OR (referent, P < 0.01). Conclusion In our study, port removal in the Clinic Procedure Room was not associated with increased risk of negative outcomes. Shifting port removal from the Main OR to the Clinic may result in substantial cost savings. © 2016 Elsevier Inc."

We take an economic and operational (patient flow) perspective to analyze the effectiveness of this policy in encouraging hospitals to reduce readmissions. We develop a game-theoretic model that captures the competition among hospitals inherent in HRRP's benchmarking mechanism. We show that this competition can be counterproductive: it increases the number of nonincentivized hospitals, which prefer paying penalties over reducing readmissions in any equilibrium. We calibrate our model with a data set of more than 3,000 hospitals in the United States and show that under the current policy, and for a large set of parameters, 4%-13% of the hospitals remain nonincentivized to reduce readmissions. We also validate our model against the actual performance of hospitals in the three years since the introduction of the policy. We draw several policy recommendations to improve this policy's outcome. For example, localizing the benchmarking process-comparing hospitals against similar peers-improves the performance of the policy. © 2016 INFORMS."

With these changes, the role of the pharmacist continues to evolve as pharmacists assume expanded roles, with hopes of achieving provider status. Thus, evaluating the delivery of psychiatric pharmacy curricula in U.S. schools of pharmacy is necessary to ensure that the students receive a strong foundation to prepare themselves to assume key roles in the management of patients with mental illness. Methods A 29-item survey was developed and disseminated to 136 schools of pharmacy electronically via SurveyMonkey®. Results Sixty-two (46%) schools of pharmacy completed the survey. A large number of schools (73%) employ faculty with psychiatric residency or fellowship training. Most schools use a variety of teaching methodologies to deliver content, with didactic lecture being the most common (86%). A majority (69%) of responders feel an adequate amount of time is dedicated to the psychiatric pharmacy curriculum, and 90% believe faculty are appropriately qualified to teach psychiatric pharmacy. Conclusions Psychiatric pharmacy education is delivered in a similar manner in a majority of U.S. pharmacy schools. Compared to previous surveys, the amount of time dedicated to psychiatric pharmacy increased and more qualified clinical faculty specializing in psychiatric pharmacy are responsible for delivering content. Additionally, an increased number of psychiatric experiential rotations are now available, along with more schools offering elective coursework. © 2016 Elsevier Inc."

This study evaluated the effectiveness of an IPV intervention in reducing violence among abused women in perinatal home visiting programs. Materials and Methods: This assessor-blinded multisite randomized control trial of 239 women experiencing perinatal IPV was conducted from 2006 to 2012 in U.S. urban and rural settings. The Domestic Violence Enhanced Home Visitation Program (DOVE) intervention group (n = 124) received a structured abuse assessment and six home visitor-delivered empowerment sessions integrated into home visits. All participants were screened for IPV and referred appropriately. IPV was measured by the Conflicts Tactics Scale2 at baseline through 24 months postpartum. Results: There was a significant decrease in IPV over time (F = 114.23; p < 0.001) from baseline to 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months postpartum (all p < 0.001). Additional models examining change in IPV from baseline indicated a significant treatment effect (F = 6.45; p < 0.01). Women in the DOVE treatment group reported a larger mean decrease in IPV scores from baseline compared to women in the usual care group (mean decline 40.82 vs. 35.87). All models accounted for age and maternal depression as covariates. Conclusions: The DOVE intervention was effective in decreasing IPV and is brief, thereby facilitating its incorporation within well-woman and well-child care visits, as well as home visiting programs, while satisfying recommendations set forth in the Affordable Care Act for IPV screening and brief counseling. © 2016 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc."

We assessed the effects of health insurance, ADAP, and income on HIV viral load suppression. Methods: We used existing cohort data from the HIV-infected participants of the Women's Interagency HIV Study. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the time from 2006 to unsuppressed HIV viral load (>200 copies/mL) among those with Medicaid, private, Medicare, or other public insurance, and no insurance, stratified by the use of ADAP. Results: In 2006, 65% of women had Medicaid, 18% had private insurance, 3% had Medicare or other public insurance, and 14% reported no health insurance. ADAP coverage was reported by 284 women (20%); 56% of uninsured participants reported ADAP coverage. After accounting for study site, age, race, lowest observed CD4, and previous health insurance, the hazard ratio (HR) for unsuppressed viral load among those privately insured without ADAP, compared with those on Medicaid without ADAP (referent group), was 0.61 (95% CI: 0.48 to 0.77). Among the uninsured, those with ADAP had a lower relative hazard of unsuppressed viral load compared with the referent group (HR, 95% CI: 0.49, 0.28 to 0.85) than those without ADAP (HR, 95% CI: 1.00, 0.63 to 1.57). Conclusions: Although women with private insurance are most likely to be virally suppressed, ADAP also contributes to viral load suppression.

Along with recent updates in HCV screening policy and expansions in insurance coverage, treatment demand in the United States is changing rapidly. Our objective was to project the characteristics and number of people needing antiviral treatment and HCV-associated disease burden in the era of oral DAAs. We used a previously developed and validated Hepatitis C Disease Burden Simulation model (HEP-SIM). HEP-SIM simulated the actual clinical management of HCV from 2001 onward, which included antiviral treatment with pegylated interferon (Peg-IFN)-based therapies as well as the recent oral DAAs, risk-based and birth-cohort HCV screening, and the impact of the Affordable Care Act. We also simulated two hypothetical scenarios—no treatment and treatment with Peg-IFN-based therapies only. We estimated that in 2010, 2.5 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.9-3.1) million noninstitutionalized people were viremic, which dropped to 1.9 (95% CI, 1.4-2.6) million in 2015, and projected to drop below 1 million by 2020. A total of 1.8 million HCV patients will receive HCV treatment from the launch of oral DAAs in 2014 until 2030. Based on current HCV management practices, it will take 4-6 years to treat the majority of patients aware of their disease. However, 560,000 patients would still remain unaware by 2020. Even in the oral DAA era, 320,000 patients will die, 157,000 will develop hepatocellular carcinoma, and 203,000 will develop decompensated cirrhosis in the next 35 years. Conclusions: HCV-associated disease burden will still remain substantial in the era of oral DAAs. Increasing HCV screening and treatment capacity is essential to further decreasing HCV burden in the United States.

Federal Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) payments help hospitals recover such uncompensated costs of Medicaid-insured and uninsured patients. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act reduces DSH payments in anticipation of fewer uninsured patients and therefore decreased uncompensated care. However, unlike adults, few hospitalized children are uninsured, while many have Medicaid coverage. Therefore, DSH payment reductions may expose extensive Medicaid financial losses for hospitals serving large absolute numbers of children. OBJECTIVES To identify types of hospitals with the highest Medicaid losses from pediatric inpatient care and to estimate the proportion of losses recovered through DSH payments. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This retrospective cross-sectional analysis evaluated Medicaid-insured hospital discharges of patients 20 years and younger from 23 states in the 2009 Kids' Inpatient Database. The dates of the analysis were March to September 2015. Hospitals were categorized as freestanding children's hospitals (FSCHs), children's hospitals within general hospitals, non-children's hospital teaching hospitals, and non-children's hospital nonteaching hospitals. Financial records of FSCHs in the data set were used to estimate the proportion of Medicaid losses recovered through DSH payments. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Hospital financial losses from inpatient care of Medicaid-insured children (defined as the reimbursement minus the cost of care) were compared across hospital types. For our subsample of FSCHs, Medicaid-insured inpatient financial losses were calculated with and without each hospital's DSH payment. RESULTS The 2009 Kids' Inpatient Database study population included 1485 hospitals and 843 725 Medicaid-insured discharges. Freestanding children's hospitals had a higher median number of Medicaid-insured discharges (4082; interquartile range [IQR], 3524-5213) vs non-children's hospital teaching hospitals (674; IQR, 258-1414) and non-children's hospital nonteaching hospitals (161; IQR, 41-420). Freestanding children's hospitals had the largest median Medicaid losses from pediatric inpatient care (-$9 722 367; IQR, -$16 248 369 to -$2 137 902). Smaller losses were experienced by non-children's hospital teaching hospitals (-$204 100; IQR, -$1 014 100 to $14 700]) and non-children's hospital nonteaching hospitals (-$28 310; IQR, -$152 370 to $9040]). Disproportionate Share Hospital payments to FSCHs reduced their Medicaid losses by almost half. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Estimated financial losses from pediatric inpatients covered by Medicaid were much larger for FSCHs than for other hospital types. For children's hospitals, small anticipated increases in insured children are unlikely to offset the reductions in DSH payments. Copyright 2016 American Medical Association. All rights reserved."

There has always been a wide range of opinions on the Supreme Court about the proper contours of legislative standing doctrine and even about whether the Court should adjudicate disputes between the other two branches at all. Perhaps owing to these disagreements, the full Court has never articulated a clear vision of the doctrine. While the Court has managed to resolve some cases, it has not achieved the consensus necessary to provide a comprehensive and coherent account of critical doctrinal issues such as what type of injury can give rise to legislative standing and which legislative injuries may support litigation by legislators, as opposed to by a legislative institution. Thus, the so-called ""legislative standing doctrine"" is less a doctrine than a loosely organized collection of ad hoc results in cases. For many years, these deficiencies hardly mattered. Legislative standing cases were so rare that the lack of a clear approach to identifying which litigants could assert which legislative injuries caused no great embarrassment. But there has been a dramatic uptick during the Obama administration in the frequency of litigation between Congress and the President. In just the past four terms, the Court has decided three cases raising legislative standing issues, and another one is undoubtedly on the way: in September 2015, the District Court for the District of Columbia granted standing to the House of Representatives to sue over the President's implementation of the Affordable Care Act (""ACA""). The uncertainty in the doctrine is thus long overdue for correction. This Article provides that correction. First, it develops an original typology of legislative injury, detailing all the varieties of ""injury"" that might afflict legislators, legislatures, and other legislative litigants, and illustrating each with examples from past legislative standing cases. Second, it articulates a method for determining which legislative injuries may be asserted by individual legislators, and which require the participation of a full chamber, or both chambers acting bicamerally. Finally, it illustrates this model by applying it to the Court's recent forays into legislative standing and the pending ACA litigation."

Methods: High utilizers were defined as patients with ≥. 4 visits in the 6. months before their most recent visit in the study period (July-December before and after Maryland's Medicaid expansion in January 2014). A differences-in-differences approach using logistic regression was used to investigate if differences between high and low utilizer cohorts changed from before and after the expansion. Results: During the study period, 726 (4.1%) out of 17,795 unique patients in 2013 and 380 (2.4%) of 16,458 during the same period in 2014 were high utilizers (p-value <. 0.001). ACSC-associated visit predicted being a high utilizer in 2013 (OR 1.66 (95% CI [1.37, 2.01])) and 2014 (OR 1.65 (95% CI [1.27, 2.15])) but this was not different between years (OR ratio 0.99, 95% CI [0.72, 1.38], p-value 0.97).

Medicare claims data for the years 1999-2004 from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services were linked to four waves of data from the Baltimore ECA cohort collected between 1981 and 2005 (n = 566). A generalized linear model with a log link and gamma distribution was used to examine direct Medicare costs associated with SUD status. Medicare recipients with no history of SUD had mean six-year costs of $42,576. Those with a history of SUD based on both Baltimore ECA and Medicare data, or based on Medicare claims data alone, had significantly higher costs ($98,754 and $64,876, respectively). A history of SUD based solely on Baltimore ECA data alone had lower average costs ($25,491).

Academic health centers must identify nimble leaders who can harness the expertise of every team member to succeed in yielding the triple aim—better care for individuals, better health for populations, and lower overall cost.

The objective of the current study was to clarify the association between insurance status and survival of patients with GBM by analyzing population-based data. METHODS: The authors performed a cohort study using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program. They included adult patients (aged ≥18 years) with GBM as their primary diagnosis from the years 2007 to 2012. Patients without information regarding insurance status were excluded. A survival analysis between insurance status and GBM-related death was performed using an accelerated failure time model. Demographic and clinical variables were included to adjust for confounding effects. RESULTS: Among the 13,665 adult patients in the study cohort, 558 (4.1%) were uninsured, 1516 (11.1%) had Medicaid coverage, and 11,591 (84.8%) had non-Medicaid insurance. Compared with patients who were uninsured, insured patients were more likely to be older, female, white, married, and with a smaller tumor size at diagnosis. Accelerated failure time analysis demonstrated that older age (hazard ratio [HR], 1.04; P<.001), male sex (HR, 1.08; P<.001), large tumor size at the time of diagnosis (HR, 1.26; P<.001), uninsured status (HR, 1.14; P =.018), and Medicaid insurance (HR, 1.10; P =.006) were independent risk factors for shorter survival among patients with GBM, whereas radiotherapy (HR, 0.40; P<.001) and married status (HR, 0.86; P<.001) indicated a better outcome. The authors discovered an overall yearly progressive improvement in survival in patients with non-Medicaid insurance who were diagnosed from 2007 through 2011 (P =.015), but not in uninsured or Medicaid-insured patients. CONCLUSIONS: Variations existed in insurance status within the GBM population. Uninsured status and Medicaid insurance suggested shorter survival compared with non-Medicaid insurance among a population of patients with GBM.

The choice for states to expand Medicaid could affect the financial health of hospitals by decreasing the proportion of patient volume and unreimbursed expenses attributable to uninsured patients while increasing revenue from newly covered patients. OBJECTIVE To estimate the association between the Medicaid expansion in 2014 and hospital finances by assessing differences between hospitals in states that expanded Medicaid and in those states that did not expand Medicaid. DESIGN AND SETTING Observational study with analysis of data for nonfederal general medical or surgical hospitals in fiscal years 2011 through 2014, using data from the American Hospital Association Annual Survey and the Health Care Cost Report Information System from the US Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Multivariable difference-in-difference regression analyses were used to compare states with Medicaid expansion with states without Medicaid expansion. Hospitals in states that expanded Medicaid eligibility before January 2014 were excluded. EXPOSURES Medicaid expansion in 2014, accounting for variation in fiscal year start dates. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Hospital-reported information on uncompensated care, uncompensated care as a percentage of total hospital expenses, Medicaid revenue, Medicaid as a percentage of total revenue, operating margins, and excess margins. RESULTS The sample included between 1200 and 1400 hospitals per fiscal year in 19 states with Medicaid expansion and between 2200 and 2400 hospitals per fiscal year in 25 states without Medicaid expansion (with sample size varying depending on the outcome measured). Expansion of Medicaid was associated with a decline of $2.8 million (95%CI,-$4.1 to-$1.6 million; P < .001) in mean annual uncompensated care costs per hospital. Hospitals in states with Medicaid expansion experienced a $3.2 million increase (95%CI, $0.9 to $5.6 million; P = .008) in mean annual Medicaid revenue per hospital, relative to hospitals in states without Medicaid expansion. Medicaid expansion was also significantly associated with improved excess margins (1.1 percentage points [95%CI, 0.1 to 2.0 percentage points]; P = .04), but not improved operating margins (1.1 percentage points [95%CI,-0.1 to 2.3 percentage points]; P = .06). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The hospitals located in the 19 states that implemented the Medicaid expansion had significantly increased Medicaid revenue, decreased uncompensated care costs, and improvements in profit margins compared with hospitals located in the 25 states that did not expand Medicaid.

Governments in the region tout the economic potential of treating foreign patients while several new private hospitals primarily target international patients. This analysis explores the perspectives of a range of medical tourism sector stakeholders in two LAC countries, Guatemala and Barbados, which are beginning to develop their medical tourism sectors. These perspectives provide insights into how beliefs about international patients are shaping the expanding regional interest in medical tourism. Methods: Structured around the comparative case study methodology, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 50 medical tourism stakeholders in each of Guatemala and Barbados (n = 100). To capture a comprehensive range of perspectives, stakeholders were recruited to represent civil society (n = 5/country), health human resources (n = 15/country), public health care and tourism sectors (n = 15/country), and private health care and tourism sectors (n = 15/country). Interviews were transcribed verbatim, coded using a collaborative process of scheme development, and analyzed thematically following an iterative process of data review. Results: Many Guatemalan stakeholders identified the Guatemalan-American diaspora as a significant source of existing international patients. Similarly, Barbadian participants identified their large recreational tourism sector as creating a ready source of foreign patients with existing ties to the country. While both Barbadian and Guatemalan medical tourism proponents share a common understanding that intra-regional patients are an existing supply of international patients that should be further developed, the dominant perception driving interest in medical tourism is the proximity of the American health care market. In the short term, this supplies a vision of a large number of Americans lacking adequate health insurance willing to travel for care, while in the long term, the Affordable Care Act is seen to be an enormous potential driver of future medical tourism as it is believed that private insurers will seek to control costs by outsourcing care to providers abroad. Conclusions: Each country has some comparative advantage in medical tourism. Assumptions about a large North American patient base, however, are not supported by reliable evidence. Pursuing this market could incur costs borne by patients in their public health systems. © 2016 The Author(s)."

The increasing life expectancy coupled with the attendant rise in breast cancer incidence and elimination of out-of-pocket expenses for screening mammography as a result of the Affordable Care Act could lead to higher utilization rates of screening mammography. Although research indicates that life expectancy should be a strong consideration when making screening decisions among older women, the extent to which screening mammography utilization is tailored to comorbidity and life expectancy is not well established. Methods/design: To identify relevant studies, a systematic search of the literature will be conducted using PubMed and EMBASE between January 1, 1991, and March 1, 2016. Additional studies will be found through citation review or by contacting experts in the field. The inclusion criteria will be any study design comprised of women aged 65 and older, assessing women's comorbidity, functional impairments, and/or health status, and reporting outcome measures that addressed mammography utilization within the last 1-5 years. For each study, two authors will independently abstract data regarding study eligibility and outcomes to determine relevance. Quantitative results will be extracted from text and tables, choosing preferably those adjusted for important confounders. Discussion: The review will provide evidence on the impact of comorbidity, functional limitations, and health status on screening mammography utilization in older women and inform decision aids in this area.

We analyzed the 2010 financial statements of 98 large, urban safety net hospital systems in 34 states, supplemented with data on population demographics, hospital features, and state policies. We used multivariate regression to identify independent predictors of three outcomes: 1) Medicaid-reliant payer mix (hospitals for which at least 25% of hospital days are paid for by Medicaid); 2) safety net revenue-to-cost ratio (Medicaid and Medicare Disproportionate Share Hospital payments and local government transfers, divided by charity care costs and Medicaid payment shortfall); and 3) operating margin. Medicaid-reliant payer mix was positively associated with more inclusive state Medicaid eligibility criteria and more minority patients. More inclusive Medicaid eligibility and higher Medicaid reimbursement rates positively predicted safety net revenue-to-cost ratio. University governance was the strongest positive predictor of operating margin. Safety net hospital financial performance varied considerably. Academic hospitals had higher operating margins, while more generous Medicaid eligibility and reimbursement policies improved hospitals' ability to recoup costs.

We present and synthesize research findings from the last 5Â years regarding both the immediate and long-term effects of the ACA. We conclude with a summary and offer a research agenda for future studies. Study Design: We identified relevant articles from peer-reviewed scholarly journals by performing a comprehensive search of major electronic databases. We also identified reports in the “gray literature” disseminated by government agencies and other organizations. Principal Findings: Overall, research shows that the ACA has substantially decreased the number of uninsured individuals through the dependent coverage provision, Medicaid expansion, health insurance exchanges, availability of subsidies, and other policy changes. Affordability of health insurance continues to be a concern for many people and disparities persist by geography, race/ethnicity, and income. Early evidence also indicates improvements in access to and affordability of health care. All of these changes are certain to ultimately impact state and federal budgets. Conclusions: The ACA will either directly or indirectly affect almost all Americans. As new and comprehensive data become available, more rigorous evaluations will provide further insights as to whether the ACA has been successful in achieving its goals.

The objective of this study was to determine whether sociodemographic variables and treatment services varied among PIPF recipients since enactment of the ACA. Methods: North Carolinians who received financial assistance from the PIPF between 1 January 2013 and 31 December 2014 were included in the study, and the cohort was divided into two groups based on receipt of assistance before or after the enactment of the ACA. Descriptive statistics were tabulated as frequencies. Comparative univariate analysis between both groups was conducted using the χ2 and Mann–Whitney U tests. All tests were two-sided and a p value &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant. All analyses were conducted using Stata. Results: Overall, 1016 individuals fulfilled the inclusion criteria, and the median age of the cohort was 49 years (interquartile range 45–55). The ACA groups did not differ significantly by age, race, and sex; however, the groups varied with respect to income, employment, and clinical stage. In addition, the groups differed on the types of services for which they received financial assistance, but no difference was observed between groups with respect to insurance status. Conclusion: Since the enactment of the health insurance market component of the ACA, there has been a reduction in subjects receiving assistance from the PIPF; however, no change in their insurance status has been observed. © 2016, Society of Surgical Oncology."

Background: Rural hospitals have served as the backbone of rural communities in the United States. Over time, these facilities have witnessed enhanced expectations, expanding their scope of operations from acute care to diversified services through linked provider networks and disaster management. Simultaneously, financial challenges, increasing emphasis on safety and quality, and the Affordable Care Act have introduced new challenges for rural hospitals. Currently, there is little empirical knowledge in this domain from a facility perspective. Methods: An exploratory qualitative study was conducted, involving semistructured interviews of upper and mid-level administrators in four rural hospitals located in West Texas. All questions attempted to obtain the subject’s knowledge, ideas, and opinions concerning the physical design of the hospitals and the hospital experience. Results: According to data on staff experiences, two classes of factors surfaced as potential influencers of hospital experience and care quality: (1) care configuration and (2) outdated building. Care configuration pertains to positioning facilities designed with inpatient care focus to a market expanding in outpatient services. Outdated buildings affect several issue including perceived provider quality and spatial accommodations for safe/efficient care and thereby also affecting the healthcare experience.

The expansion of Medicaid and creation of healthcare exchanges to compete with existing commercial payers will alter the current payer-mix seen at AMC's. While prior studies have analyzed this impact at a hospital level, we evaluated these changes in payer-mix on three distinct internal medicine service lines by modeling out their effect on overall contribution margin (CM) for each service line using actual hospital data collected from a tertiary-care, urban AMC. We performed a sensitivity analysis to account for varying rates of participation in the newly created exchanges using 33, 50, and 100% take-up rates to simulate the unknown migration of current commercial patients to exchanges in addition to a threshold analysis. We found that despite an increase in CM from Medicaid expansion, the negative impact on CM from commercial patients migrating to exchange plans at all three take-up rates caused an overall loss in CM across all three service lines ranging from $215 020 to $1 482 597. Threshold points ranged from 19 to 37% across service lines. Our results reveal that the key drivers to determining the impact on CM is ultimately driven by what exchange rates will be set at as well as how many current commercial patients transition to the newly created exchanges. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

Officially, the reform aimed to improve access for the uninsured and underinsured, in collaboration with the private, for-profit insurance industry. After several historical attempts at health reform adhering to the neoliberal pattern, favored by international financial institutions and multinational insurance corporations, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) similarly enhanced access by corporations to public-sector trust funds. An ideology favoring for-profit corporations in the marketplace justified these reforms through unproven claims about the efficiency of the private sector and enhanced quality of care under principles of competition and business management. The ACA maintains this historical continuity by dealing with health care as a commodity bought and sold in a marketplace, rather than a fundamental human right to be guaranteed according to principles of social solidarity.

We surveyed 1,151 adults visiting safety-net emergency departments in Massachusetts in late 2013 on their preference for NHI or the Massachusetts reform and on their experiences with insurance.

The Affordable Care Act allows uninsured individuals to select health insurance from numerous private plans, a challenging decision-making process. This study examined the effectiveness of strategies to support health insurance decisions among the uninsured. Methods. Participants (N = 343) from urban, suburban, and rural areas were randomized to 1 of 3 conditions: 1) a plain language table; 2) a visual condition where participants chose what information to view and in what order; and 3) a narrative condition. We administered measures assessing knowledge (true/false responses about key features of health insurance), confidence in choices (uncertainty subscale of the Decisional Conflict Scale), satisfaction (items from the Health Information National Trends Survey), preferences for insurance features (measured on a Likert scale from not at all important to very important), and plan choice. Results. Although we did not find significant differences in knowledge, confidence in choice, or satisfaction across condition, participants across conditions made value-consistent choices, selecting plans that aligned with their preferences for key insurance features. In addition, those with adequate health literacy skills as measured by the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine-Short Form (REALM-SF) had higher knowledge overall (x = 6.1 v. 4.8, P < 0.001) and preferred the plain language table to the visual (P = 0.04) and visual to narrative (P = 0.0002) conditions, while those with inadequate health literacy skills showed no preference for study condition. A similar pattern was seen for those with higher subjective numeracy skills and higher versus lower education with regard to health insurance knowledge. Individuals with higher income felt less confident in their choices (x = 28.7 v. 10.0, where higher numbers indicate less confidence/more uncertainty; P = 0.004). Conclusions. Those developing materials about the health insurance marketplace to support health insurance decisions might consider starting with plain language tables, presenting health insurance terminology in context, and organizing information according to ways the uninsured might use and value insurance features. Individuals with limited health literacy and numeracy skills and those with lower education face unique challenges selecting health insurance and weighing tradeoffs between cost and coverage. © The Author(s) 2015."

It is unclear what impact Medicaid expansion will have on transplantation outcomes. We performed a retrospective cohort analysis to measure the frequency and variation in Medicaid transplantation and post-transplantation survival in Medicaid patients. Study Design Adult heart, lung, liver, and renal transplant recipients between 2002 and 2011 (n = 169,194) reported to the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients were identified. Transplant recipients were classified based on insurance status (private, Medicare or Medicaid). Outcomes measures included 5-year post-transplantation survival, summarized using Kaplan-Meier curves and compared with log-rank tests. Organ-specific Cox proportional hazards models were used to adjust for donor and recipient factors. Results Medicaid patients comprised 8.6% of all organ transplant recipients. Fewer transplantations were performed than expected among Medicaid beneficiaries for all organs except liver (liver: observed to expected ratio = 1.21; 95% CI, 0.68–1.90; heart: observed to expected ratio = 0.89; 95% CI, 0.44–1.49; lung: observed to expected ratio = 0.57; 95% CI, 0.22–1.06; renal: observed to expected ratio = 0.32; 95% CI, 0.08–0.72). Medicaid transplant recipients were listed with more severe organ failure and experienced shorter transplant wait times. Post-transplantation survival was lower in Medicaid patients compared with private insurance for all organs. Post-transplantation survival in Medicaid patients was similar to Medicare patients for heart, liver, and renal but lower in lung. Conclusions Medicaid organ transplant beneficiaries had significantly lower survival compared with privately insured beneficiaries. The more severe organ failure among Medicaid beneficiaries at the time of listing, suggested a pattern of late referral, which might account for worse outcomes. Implementation of the Affordable Care Act gives the opportunity to develop the necessary infrastructure to ensure timely transplantation referrals and improve long-term outcomes in this vulnerable population. © 2016 American College of Surgeons"

Aims: Using the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database from 2001 to 2012, we aimed to evaluate factors contributing to hospital cost of patients admitted to US hospitals for TIPS. Methods: Using the NIS, we identified a discharge-weighted national estimate of 61,004 TIPS procedures from 2001 to 2012. Through independent sample analysis, we determined profile factors related to increases in hospital costs. Results: Of all TIPS cases, the mean charge adjusted for inflation to the year 2012 is $125,044 ± $160,115. The mean hospital cost adjusted for inflation is $44,901 ± $54,565. Comparing pre- and post-2005, mean charges and cost have increased considerably ($98,154 vs. $142,652, p < 0.001 and $41,656 vs. $46,453, p < 0.001, respectively). Patients transferred from a different hospital, weekend admissions, Asian/Pacific Islander patients, and hospitals in the Northeastern and Western region had higher cost. Number of diagnoses and number of procedures show positive correlations with hospital cost, with number of procedures exhibiting stronger relationships (Pearson 0.613). Comorbidity measures with highest increases in cost were pulmonary circulation disorders ($32,157 increase, p < 0.001). Conclusion: The cost of the TIPS procedure is gradually rising for hospitals.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between PCC, diabetes self-care, glycemic control, and quality of life (QOL) in a sample of adults with type 2 diabetes. Methods: Six hundred fifteen patients were recruited from two adult primary care clinics in the southeastern United States. Primary outcome variables were self-care behaviors (medication adherence, diet, exercise, blood sugar testing, and foot care), glycemic control, and QOL (physical component summary [PCS] score and mental component summary [MCS] score of SF12). PCC was assessed using a modified 7-item Picker Patient Experience Questionnaire. Regression modeling was used to assess independent associations while adjusting for relevant covariates. Results: In adjusted analyses, PCC was significantly associated with PCS QOL (β = -0.03, 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.05 to -0.01), MCS QOL (β = 0.09, 95% CI 0.04-0.14), medication adherence (β = 0.12, 95% CI 0.08-0.17), general diet (β = 0.12, 95% CI 0.07-0.17), specific diet (β = 0.05, 95% CI 0.01-0.08), blood sugar testing (β = 0.09, 95% CI 0.04-0.15), and foot care (β = 0.12, 95% CI 0.07-0.18). Conclusion: PCC is associated with diabetes self-management and QOL, but was not significantly associated with glycemic control in patients with diabetes.

This study investigates the extent to which physician assistant (PA) students report learning about the PCMH model and how clinical exposure to PCMH might impact their interest in a primary care career. METHODS: An electronic survey was distributed to second-year PA students who had recently completed their PC rotation from 12 PA programs. Descriptive statistics and ordered logistic regression analyses were used to characterize the results. RESULTS: A total of 202 second-year PA students completed the survey. When asked about their knowledge of the new health care delivery models, 30% of the students responded they had received instruction about the PCMH. Twenty- five percent of respondents stated they were oriented to new payment structures proposed in the Affordable Care Act and quality improvement principles. Based on their experiences in the primary care clerkship, 64% stated they were likely to pursue a career in primary care, 13% were not likely, and 23% were unsure. Predictors of interest in a primary care career included: (1) age greater than 35 years, (2) being a recipient of a NHSC scholarship, (3) clerkship site setting in an urban cluster of 2,500 to 50,000 people, (4) number of PCMH elements offered at site, and (4) positive impression of team-based care.

This increased access to treatment has broad implications for delivering health services and creates a dramatic need for transformation in clinical care, service lines, and collaborative care models. Medication-assisted treatments (MAT) are effective for helping SUD patients reach better outcomes. This article uses electronic health record (EHR) data to examine the prevalence of EHR-documented SUDs, patient characteristics, and patterns of MAT prescribing and screening for patients within the Community Health Applied Research Network (CHARN), a national network of 17 community health centers that facilitates patient-centered outcomes research among underserved populations. Methods: Hierarchical generalized linear models examined patient characteristics, SUD occurrence rates, MAT prescription, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis virus C screening for patients with AUDs or OUDs. Results: Among 572,582 CHARN adult patients, 16,947 (3.0%) had a documented AUD diagnosis and 6,080 (1.1%) an OUD diagnosis. Alcohol MAT prescriptions were documented for 547 AUD patients (3.2%) and opioid MAT for 1,764 OUD patients (29.0%). Among OUD patients, opioid MAT was significantly associated with HIV screening (odds ratio [OR] = 1.31, P <.001) in OUD patients, as was alcohol MAT among AUD patients (OR = 1.30, P =.013).

Methods: Longitudinal data on client-reported physical health status, clinician-reported mental health recovery, and screening for common chronic conditions among 1,941 persons enrolled in integrated care programs for serious mental illness and chronic general medical illness were combined with site visit data measuring the level of integration of general medical and mental health care among ten integrated care programs. Various analyses were used to compare outcomes by level of program integration (generalized estimating equations for physical health status and mental health recovery and logistic regression and chisquare tests for screening for common chronic conditions and clinical risk factors). Results: Clients in more highly integrated programs had greater improvements in physical health status and mental health recovery and higher rates of screening for common chronic conditions compared with clients in less integrated programs. They also had greater reductions in hypertension but a worrisome increase in prediabetes and diabetes. Conclusions: Highly integrated mental health and general medical programs were associated with greater improvements in health outcomes compared with less integrated programs. Additional research is necessary to identify predictors of integration, to determine which aspects of integration drive improvements in health outcomes, and to identify strategies to increase integration within less integrated programs.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine if uninsured CHC patients who gain Medicaid coverage experience greater primary care utilization, receive more cessation medication orders, and achieve higher quit rates, compared to continuously uninsured smokers. DESIGN: Longitudinal observational cohort study using electronic health record data from a network of Oregon CHCs linked to Oregon Medicaid enrollment data. PATIENTS: Cohort of patients who smoke and who gained Medicaid coverage in 2008–2011 after ≥ 6 months of being uninsured and with ≥ 1 smoking assessment in the 24-month follow-up period from the baseline smoking status date. This group was propensity score matched to a cohort of continuously uninsured CHC patients who smoke (n = 4140 matched pairs; 8280 patients).

CONCLUSIONS: Newly insured patients had increased odds of quit smoking status over 24 months of follow-up than those who remained uninsured. Providing insurance coverage to vulnerable populations may have a significant impact on smoking cessation. © 2016, Society of General Internal Medicine."

There is a growing interest in understanding the impact of evidence-based heart failure therapy on 30-day all-cause readmission. In the current study, we examined the impact of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ACEI-ARBs) on 30-day all-cause readmission in heart failure. Methods Of the 1384 hospitalized Medicare beneficiaries with heart failure and left ventricular ejection fraction <45% discharged alive from 106 Alabama hospitals (1998-2001) without prior ACEI-ARB use and without known contraindications to ACEI-ARB use; 734 received new predischarge prescriptions for these drugs. Using propensity scores for ACEI-ARB initiation, we assembled a matched cohort of 477 pairs of patients balanced on 32 baseline characteristics (mean age 75 years, 46% women, 26% African American). Results Thirty-day all-cause readmissions occurred in 18% and 24% of matched patients receiving and not receiving ACEI-ARBs, respectively (hazard ratio [HR] 0.74; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.56-0.97; P = .030). ACEI-ARB use was also associated with lower risk of 30-day all-cause mortality (HR 0.56; 95% CI, 0.33-0.98; P = .041) and of the combined endpoint of 30-day all-cause readmission or 30-day all-cause mortality (HR 0.73; 95% CI, 0.56-0.94; P = .017). All associations remained significant at 1 year post discharge. Conclusions Among hospitalized patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction, the use of ACEI-ARBs was associated with a significantly lower risk of 30-day all-cause readmission and 30-day all-cause mortality; both beneficial associations persisted during long-term follow-up. © 2016"

A recent study found that the value of these healthcare subsidies varied with the number of health plans in the different geographic rating areas, but that study only examined the premiums and the deductibles of those health plans. OBJECTIVES: To examine the value of subsidies of health plans, including cost-sharing for prescription drugs in the health insurance marketplace. METHODS: We have used publicly available health plan data from HealthCare.gov and from county population data obtained from the US Census Bureau in June 2015. The average-weighted premium; medical deductible; medical maximum out-of-pocket spending; and cost-sharing for generic drugs, preferred and nonpreferred brand-name drugs, and specialty drugs were calculated for the second lowest-cost silver plan in each geographic rating area. These were then compared across geographic areas with different numbers of plans to determine the value of the subsidies. We also compared the difference between the cost of the average silver plan and the second lowest-cost silver plan for each area to determine the cost to enrollees if they selected the average silver plan. RESULTS: The monetary value of the subsidies provided by health plans was lower in areas with a larger number of plans, because the second lowest-cost silver plans in these areas tended to have lower premiums and higher deductibles. For the most common type of cost-sharing for generic and for preferred brand-name drugs, plan enrollees would likely have a lower or similar copayment if they selected the average-cost silver plan instead of the second lowest-cost silver plan. However, they may end up paying approximately $8 less in copayment for nonpreferred branded drugs and approximately 4% less for coinsurance after a deductible for specialty drugs if they resided in a geographic area with fewer than 11 plans. CONCLUSION: The value of subsidies provided by the ACA-initiated health plans in the healthcare marketplace, including cost-sharing for prescription drugs, varies across geographic areas with different numbers of health plans. This suggests that potential enrollees should consider cost-sharing for prescription drugs in addition to health plans’ premiums and deductibles when choosing their health plan. © 2016 by Engage Healthcare Communications, LLC, all rights reserved."

In addition, while coverage gains from the ACA's Medicaid expansion are well documented, impacts on utilization and health are unclear. Objective: To assess changes in access to care, utilization, and self-reported health among low-income adults in 3 states taking alternative approaches to the ACA. Design, Setting, and Participants Differences-in-differences analysis of survey data from November 2013 through December 2015 of US citizens ages 19 to 64 years with incomes below 138%of the federal poverty level in Kentucky, Arkansas, and Texas (n = 8676). Data analysis was conducted between January and May 2016. Exposures: Medicaid expansion in Kentucky and use of Medicaid funds to purchase private insurance for low-income adults in Arkansas (private option), compared with no expansion in Texas. Main Outcomes And Measures: Self-reported access to primary care, specialty care, and medications; affordability of care; outpatient, inpatient, and emergency utilization; receiving glucose and cholesterol testing, annual check-up, and care for chronic conditions; quality of care, depression score, and overall health. Results: Among the 3 states included in the study, Arkansas (n=2890), Kentucky (n=2898, and Texas (n=2888), therewere no differences in sex, income, or marital status. Respondents from Texaswere younger, more urban, and disproportionately Latino compared with those in Arkansas and Kentucky. Significant changes in coverage and accesswere more apparent in 2015 than in 2014. By 2015, expansionwas associated with a 22.7 percentage-point reduction in the uninsured rate compared with nonexpansion (P < .001). Expansionwas associated with significantly increased access to primary care (12.1 percentage points; P < .001), fewer skipped medications due to cost (-11.6 percentage points; P < .001), reduced out-of-pocket spending (-29.5%; P = .02), reduced likelihood of emergency department visits (-6.0percentage points, P = .04), and increased outpatient visits (0.69 visits per year; P = .04). Screening for diabetes (6.3 percentage points; P = .05), glucose testing among patients with diabetes (10.7 percentage points; P = .03), and regular care for chronic conditions (12.0percentage points; P = .008) all increased significantly after expansion. Quality of care ratings improved significantly (-7.1 percentage points with ""fair/poor quality of care""; P = .03), as did the share of adults reporting excellent health (4.8 percentage points; P = .04). Comparisons of Arkansas vs Kentucky showed increased private coverage in the former (21.7 percentage points; P < .001), increased Medicaid in the latter (21.3 percentage points; P < .001), and higher diabetic glucose testing rates in Kentucky (11.6 percentage points; P = .04), but no other statistically significant differences. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In the second year of expansion, Kentucky's Medicaid program and Arkansas's private optionwere associated with significant increases in outpatient utilization, preventive care, and improved health care quality; reductions in emergency department use; and improved self-reported health. Aside from the type of coverage obtained, outcomes were similar for nearly all other outcomes between the 2 states using alternative approaches to expansion.

Complex patients, including those with chronic kidney disease (CKD), present the most challenges and opportunities. CKD is a condition with significant morbidity, mortality, and cost and thought to be partly secondary to known gaps in care delivery. Successful population management for CKD requires consideration of the needs of patients at all phases of the disease. In this article, we offer a comprehensive framework for a population-based approach to CKD and examples of programs we are implementing in each area. These initiatives include the development and implementation of an electronic nephrology consult (e-consult) platform, CKD quality metrics, CKD registry, CKD collaborative care agreement, multidisciplinary care clinic for advanced CKD, end-stage renal disease care coordinator program, shared decision-making tools for renal replacement, CKD education videos, and a tablet-based CKD patient-reported outcome measures tool. © 2016 National Kidney Foundation, Inc."

The purpose of this study is to explore the dynamic processes and interactions by which workforce planning and development (WFPD) is evolving in this new environment. Methods: Informed by the theory of loosely coupled systems (LCS), we use a case study design to examine how workforce changes are being managed in Kaiser Permanente and Montefiore Health System. We conducted site visits with in-depth interviews with 8 to 10 stakeholders in each organization. Results: Both systems demonstrate a concern for the impact of change on their workforce and have made commitments to avoid outsourcing and layoffs. Central workforce planning mechanisms have been replaced with strategies to integrate various stakeholders and units in alignment with strategic growth plans. Features of this new approach include early and continuous engagement of labor in innovation; the development of intermediary sense-making structures to garner resources, facilitate plans, and build consensus; and a whole system perspective, rather than a focus on single professions. We also identify seven principles underlying the WFPD processes in these two cases that can aid in development of a new and more adaptive workforce strategy in healthcare. Conclusions: Since passage of the ACA, healthcare systems are becoming larger and more complex. Insights from these case studies suggest that while organizational history and structure determined different areas of emphasis, our results indicate that large-scale system transformations in healthcare can be managed in ways that enhance the skills and capacities of the workforce. Our findings merit attention, not just by healthcare administrators and union leaders, but by policymakers and scholars interested in making WFPD policies at a state and national level more responsive. © 2016 The Author(s)."

The political, social, and health consequences of austerity--along with fallout from the 2008 financial collapse and the shortcomings of the Affordable Care Act (ACA)--are made evident in websites like GoFundMe. Here, patients and caregivers create campaigns to solicit donations for medical care, hoping that they will spread widely through social networks. As competition increases among campaigns, patients and their loved ones are obliged to produce compelling and sophisticated appeals. Despite the growing popularity of crowdfunding, little research has explored the usage, impacts, or consequences of the increasing reliance on it for health in the U.S. or abroad. This paper analyzes data from a mixed-methods study conducted from March-September 2016 of 200 GoFundMe campaigns, identified through randomized selection. In addition to presenting exploratory quantitative data on the characteristics and relative success of these campaigns, a more in-depth textual analysis examines how crowdfunders construct narratives about illness and financial need, and attempt to demonstrate their own deservingness. Concerns with the financial burdens of illness, combined with a high proportion of campaigns in states without ACA Medicaid expansion, underscored the importance of crowdfunding as a response to contexts of austerity. Successful crowdfunding requires that campaigners master medical and media literacies; as such, we argue that crowdfunding has the potential to deepen social and health inequities in the U.S. by promoting forms of individualized charity that rely on unequally-distributed literacies to demonstrate deservingness and worth. Crowdfunding narratives also distract from crises of healthcare funding and gaping holes in the social safety net by encouraging hyper-individualized accounts of suffering on media platforms where precarity is portrayed as the result of inadequate self-marketing, rather than the inevitable consequences of structural conditions of austerity. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd."

Veterans with multiple health conditions, such as the homeless, may be particularly susceptible to the adverse effects of dual use. Homeless veteran dual use is an understudied yet timely topic given the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and Veterans Choice Act of 2014, both of which may increase non-VA care for this population. The study purpose was to evaluate homeless veteran dual use of VA and non-VA health care by describing the experiences, perspectives, and recommendations of community providers who care for the population. Methods: Three semi-structured focus group interviews were conducted with medical, dental, and behavioral health providers at a large, urban Health Care for the Homeless (HCH) program. Qualitative content analysis procedures were used. Results: HCH providers experienced challenges coordinating care with VA medical centers for their veteran patients. Participants lacked knowledge about the VA health care system and were unable to help their patients navigate it. The HCH and VA medical centers lacked clear lines of communication. Providers could not access the VA medical records of their patients and felt this hampered the quality and efficiency of care veterans received. Conclusions: Substantial challenges exist in coordinating care for homeless veteran dual users. Our findings suggest recommendations related to education, communication, access to electronic medical records, and collaborative partnerships. Without dedicated effort to improve coordination, dual use is likely to exacerbate the fragmented care that is the norm for many homeless persons. © 2016 The Author(s)."

Effective September 23, 2010, the ACA has required all private health insurance plans to cover dependents until the age of 26. However, it is unknown whether the ACA dependent coverage expansion had an impact on prescription drug insurance or the use of prescription drugs. Objectives To evaluate short-term changes in prescription health insurance coverage, prescription drug insurance coverage, prescription drug use, and prescription drug expenditures following implementation of the ACA young adult insurance expansion using national data from 2009 and 2011. Results Full-year health insurance coverage increased 4.9 percentage points during the study period, which was mainly due to increases in private health insurance among middle- and high-income young adults. In contrast, full-year prescription drug insurance coverage increased 5.5 percentage points and was primarily concentrated among high-income young adults. Although no significant short-term changes in overall prescription drug use were observed, a 30% decrease in out-of-pocket expenditures was seen among young adults.

Whether the ACA's mandate has impacted long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARC) use is unknown. Objective: The aim of this article is to assess trends in LARC cost-sharing and uptake before and one year after implementation of the ACA's contraceptive mandate. Design: A retrospective cohort study using Truven Health MarketScan claims data from January 2010 to December 2013. Subjects: Women aged 18-45 years with continuous insurance coverage with claims for oral contraceptive pills, patches, rings, injections, or LARC during 2010-2013 (N=3,794,793). Measures: Descriptive statistics were used to assess trends in LARC cost-sharing and uptake from 2010 through 2013. Interrupted time series models were used to assess the association of time, ACA, and time after the ACA on LARC cost-sharing and initiation rates, adjusting for patient and plan characteristics. Results: The proportion of claims with $0 cost-sharing for intrauterine devices and implants, respectively, rose from 36.6% and 9.3% in 2010 to 87.6% and 80.5% in 2013. The ACA was associated with a significant increase in these proportions and in their rate of increase (level and slope change both P<0.001).

The implementation of ACA is likely to influence the insurance status of Americans and reimbursement rates of trauma centers. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of ACA on the patient insurance status, hospital reimbursements, and clinical outcomes at a Level I trauma center. We hypothesized that there would be a significant decrease in the proportion of uninsured trauma patients visiting our Level I trauma center following the ACA, and this is associated with improved reimbursement. METHODS We performed a retrospective analysis of the trauma registry and financial database at our Level I trauma center for a 27-month (July 2012 to September 2014) period by quarters. Our outcome measures were change in insurance status, hospital reimbursement rates (total payments/expected payments), and clinical outcomes before and after ACA (March 31, 2014). Trend analysis was performed to assess trends in outcomes over each quarter (3 months). RESULTS A total of 9,892 patients were included in the study. The overall uninsured rate during the study period was 20.3%. Post-ACA period was associated with significantly lower uninsured rate (p < 0.001). During the same time, there was as a significant increase in the Medicaid patients (p = 0.009). This was associated with significantly improved hospital reimbursements (p < 0.001). On assessing clinical outcomes, there was no change in hospitalization (p = 0.07), operating room procedures (p = 0.99), mortality (p = 0.88), or complications (p = 0.20). Post-ACA period was also not associated with any change in the hospital (p = 0.28) or length of stay at intensive care unit (p = 0.66). CONCLUSION The implementation of ACA has led to a decrease in the number of uninsured trauma patients. There was a significant increase in Medicaid trauma patients. This was associated with an increase in hospital reimbursements that substantially improved the financial revenues. Despite the controversies, implementation of ACA has the potential to substantially improve the financial outcomes of trauma centers through Medicaid expansion. © 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc."

In 2012, the Supreme Court ruled in support of most provisions but held that the mandatory Medicaid expansion was unconstitutional, in effect making it optional for the states. Yet Medicaid expansion is critical if the ACA is to achieve its goal of substantially increasing coverage, especially for lower-income adults with health problems, many of whom are racial and ethnic minorities. This article examines the factors explaining state variation in Medicaid expansion from 2012 to 2014.

Through ethnography of face-to-face interaction between navigators and the uninsured poor in Chicago, this study shows that successful navigators deployed a combination of cultural repertoires for building trust and legitimacy. These repertoires included ceding control of the conversation, creating ethnic solidarity, and disassociating themselves from government bureaucrats or self-serving insurance employees.

Methods: Employing standard explanators of state policy choices, coupled with common indicators of public health, we examine a cross-sectional, 50-state regression model to determine whether southern states are different from other states in their policy choices in this arena. Results: We find that southern state choices are driven by control of the governor's mansion, while other factors drive non-South state choices.

While Medicaid unambiguously reduces out-of-pocket premium and medical costs for low-income people, it is less certain that marketplace coverage and other types of insurance purchased to comply with the law's individual mandate also protect from high health spending. Goal: To compare out-of-pocket spending in 2014 to spending in 2013; assess how this spending changed in states where many people enrolled in the marketplaces relative to states where few people enrolled; and project the decline in the percentage of people paying high amounts out-of-pocket. Methods: Linear regression models were used to estimate whether people under age 65 spent above certain thresholds. Key findings and conclusions: The probability of incurring high out-of-pocket costs and premium expenses declined as marketplace enrollment increased. The percentage reductions were greatest among those with incomes between 250 percent and 399 percent of poverty, those who were eligible for premium subsidies, and those who previously were uninsured or had very limited nongroup coverage. These effects appear largely attributable to marketplace enrollment rather than to other ACA provisions or to economic trends."

The growth of peer-run and recovery community organizations in the changing health care environment are discussed, including issues related to workforce development, funding, relevant policies, and opportunities for expansion. These initiatives are designed to increase access to recovery-promoting services. Methods: We conducted an environmental scan and analysis of peer support services within the behavioral health care field in the United States, with particular attention to initiatives of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. Published manuscripts, policy statements, and reports were reviewed. Findings: There is abundant and growing literature illustrating how peer support services have become an integral component of behavioral health care systems in many states. Peer support services have the potential to increase access to recovery-oriented services for people with mental and substance use disorders served by the public behavioral health care system.

Although the provision improved coverage and survey-reported access to care, little is known regarding its impact on timely access for acute conditions. This study aims to assess changes in insurance coverage and perforation rates among young adults with acute appendicitis - an established metric for population-level health care access - after the DCP. Methods: The National Inpatient Sample and difference-in-differences linear regression were used to assess prepolicy/postpolicy changes for policy-eligible young adults (aged 19-25 y) compared with a slightly older, policy-ineligible comparator group (aged 26-34 y). Results: After adjustment for covariates, 19-25 year olds experienced a 3.6-percentage point decline in the uninsured rate after the DCP (baseline 22.5%), compared with 26-34 year olds (P<0.001). This coincided with a 1.4-percentage point relative decline in perforated appendix rate for 19-25 year olds (baseline 17.5%), compared with 26-34 year olds (P=0.023). All subgroups showed significant reductions in uninsured rates; however, statistically significant reductions in perforation rates were limited to racial/ethnic minorities, patients from lower-income communities, and patients presenting to urban teaching hospitals. Conclusions: Reductions in uninsured rates among young adults after the DCP were associated with significant reductions in perforated appendix rates relative to a comparator group, suggesting that insurance expansion could lead to fewer delays in seeking and accessing care for acute conditions. Greater relative declines in perforation rates among the most at-risk subpopulations hold important implications for the use of coverage expansion to mitigate existing disparities in access to care.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether insurance status predicts for more advanced disease in these four currently screened cancers. Study design The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database was queried for breast, prostate, colorectal and cervix in patients aged 18–64 years. The database was queried from 2007 to 2011, with 425,614 patients with known insurance status included. Methods Multinomial logistic regression was used to evaluate insurance status and cancer presentation. Results Under multivariate analysis for breast cancer, uninsured patients more often had invasive disease (odds ratio [OR]: 1.55), T- (OR: 2.00), N- (OR: 1.59) stage, and metastatic disease (OR: 3.48), and were more often high-grade (OR: 1.21). For prostate cancer, uninsured patients again presented more commonly with higher T-stage (OR: 1.45), nodal (OR: 2.90) and metastatic (OR: 4.98) disease, in addition to higher prostate-specific antigen (OR: 2.85) and Gleason score (OR: 1.65). Colorectal cancer had similar findings with uninsured individuals presenting with more invasive disease (OR: 1.78), higher T (OR: 1.86), N (OR: 1.22), and M (OR: 1.58) stage, in addition to higher carcinoembryonic antigen levels (OR: 1.66). Similar results were seen for cervical cancer with uninsured having higher T (OR: 2.03), N (OR: 1.21), and M (OR: 1.45) stage.

The National Institutes of Health's ResearchMatch recruitment tool was used to facilitate Internetmediated data collection from 376 patients with cancer. DES-10 scores demonstrated good internal consistency reliability (α = .80), and the hypothesized unidimensional factor structure fit the data well. The reliability and factor structure were supported across subgroups based on demographic, socioeconomic, and health characteristics. Higher DES-10 scores were associated with better health-related quality of life (r = .31). In concurrent validity analyses controlling for age, socioeconomic status, and health-related quality of life, higher DES-10 scores were associated with higher scores on quality-of-care indices, including greater awareness of one's treatments, greater preferences for shared decision making, and clearer preferences about end-of-life care. A mini-measure, the DES-3, also performed well psychometrically. In conclusion, DES-10 and DES-3 scores showed evidence of reliability and validity, and these brief patient-reported measures can be used by researchers, clinicians, nonprofits, hospitals, insurers, and policymakers interested in evaluating and improving the quality of cancer care. © 2016 American Psychological Association."

Payments have never been analyzed in detail among urologists. Methods We reviewed the most recent CMS Open Payments database for the full year 2014, released on June 30, 2015. Urology practitioners were extracted and the database was analyzed for number of total payments, total dollar value of payments, mean, median and number of physicians, number of manufacturers, and number of drugs/biologicals. Data were further categorized according to provider specialty, form of payment, nature of payment, practitioner ownership and dispute status. Results Payments totaled $32,450,382. Practitioner payments were unevenly distributed, with a median payment of $15. The majority of payments were in the form of food and beverage. Female pelvic medicine practitioners received the highest payments out of the provider specialties. The largest categorical difference from the median was in the form of stock, options and other ownership interests ($24,050). Ownership status and disputed payments were associated with payment values above median values ($400 and $61, respectively).

Recently published guidelines by the American Academy of Pediatrics create a new consensus among professional organizations around the suitability of long-acting reversible contraceptives as first-line contraception for adolescents. Through a narrative review of U.S. studies published after 2000, this study seeks to summarize existing access barriers to long-acting reversible contraceptives for adolescents and highlight areas that warrant further intervention so that the recommendations of these professional organizations can be effectively integrated into clinical practice. Existing barriers include costs for institutions providing contraceptive care and for recipients; consent and confidentiality for adolescent patients; providers' attitudes, misconceptions and limited training; and patients' lack of awareness or misconceptions. Systemic policy interventions are required to address cost and confidentiality, such as the Affordable Care Act's mandate that contraceptive coverage be a part of essential health benefits for all insurance providers. Individual-level access barriers such as providers' misconceptions and gaps in technical training as well as patients' lack of awareness can be addressed directly by professional medical organizations, health care training programs, and other interventions. © 2016 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine"

Despite passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010) that requires all qualifying employers to provide mothers “reasonable” break time and a private, non-bathroom space to express breast milk, the majority of women in the United States still do not have access to both accommodations. The Problem At least three issues may be influencing this suboptimal implementation at workplaces: 1) federal law does not address lactation space functionality and accessibility, 2) federal law only protects a subset of employees, and 3) enforcement of the federal law requires women to file a complaint with the United States Department of Labor. Recommendations To address each of these issues, we recommend the following modifications to current law: 1) additional requirements surrounding lactation space and functionality, 2) mandated coverage of exempt employees, and 3) requirement that employers develop company-specific lactation policies. Conclusions If the goal is to give women a real choice of whether to continue breastfeeding after returning to work, we must provide the proper social and structural supports that will allow for a truly personal decision. No mother should have to choose between breastfeeding her child and earning a paycheck. © 2016 Jacobs Institute of Women's Health"

This is one of the most pivotal moments in the history of nursing and we must act with deliberate and swift intention. Nurses can no longer be viewed as “just caregivers”. Nurses must be seen as leaders, influencers, advocates and change agents. To solidify this viewpoint, nurses must pursue these roles from the bedside to the boardroom, from the breakroom to the classroom. Transformation of nursing needs to occur and is intimately aligned in three broad areas: practice, leadership and education. Nurses as leaders must move beyond managing discrete parts of an organization to integrating the interrelationship of the parts through the utilization of systems thinking to achieve operational excellence.

The DHHS Office of Civil Rights enforces Section 1557. These new regulations and accompanying commentary give warning of the standards the agency will use in its enforcement efforts. Courts will also give some deference to the DHHS regulations in interpreting the statute in lawsuits by individuals claiming damages against covered health care providers for illegal discrimination under Section 1557. Three central issues are the nature of the rights created in Section 1557 and their relation to the listed federal antidiscrimination statutes, the sorts of health care programs and activities that are covered by Section 1557, and the definition of the personal characteristics, including sexual orientation and gender identity, against which discrimination is prohibited. © 2016 The Hastings Center"

While a large body of previous work has estimated the effects of that contracting, surprisingly little has investigated how those effects vary with the generosity of the contract. In this paper we examine this issue in the Medicare Advantage (MA) program, through which the federal government contracts with private insurers to coordinate and finance health care for 17 million Medicare recipients. To do this, we exploit a substantial policy-induced increase in MA reimbursement in metropolitan areas with a population of 250,000 or more relative to MSAs below this threshold. Our results demonstrate that the additional reimbursement leads more private firms to enter this market and to an increase in the share of Medicare recipients enrolled in MA plans. Our findings also reveal that about one-eighth of the additional reimbursement is passed through to consumers in the form of better coverage. A somewhat larger share accrues to private insurers in the form of higher profits and we find suggestive evidence of a large impact on advertising expenditures. Our results have implications for a key feature of the Affordable Care Act that will reduce reimbursement to MA plans by $156 billion from 2013 to 2022. © 2016 Elsevier B.V."

Well-known risk factors are age, cytogenetics, and treatment intensity. The purpose of our study was to investigate the effects of insurance status on the outcome of AML; age, Carlson comorbidity index, distance travelled to the treatment center, and type of treatment center were adjusted by analyzing data from National Cancer Database (NCDB). In the wake of the Affordable Care Act, and its impact on insurance coverage, evaluating the effect having insurance has on health outcome is urgently necessary. Materials and Methods: Data were analyzed from 67,443 men and women (18 years of age), who were registered in the NCDB and diagnosed with AML between 1998 and 2011 with follow-up to the end of 2012. The primary predictor variable was payer status, and the outcome variable was overall survival. Additional variables addressed and adjusted, included: sex, age, race, Charleston Comorbidity index, level of education, income, distance traveled, facility type, diagnosing/treating facility, treatment delay, and chemotherapy. Results: In multivariate analysis, after adjusting for other predictor variables, payer status was a statistically significant predictor of overall survival for AML. Relative to privately insured patients, patients with Medicaid had a 17% increased risk, those without insurance had a 21% increased risk, those with Medicare had a 19% increased risk and those with unknown insurance status had a 22% increased risk of mortality from AML. The percentage of patients surviving from AML after 24 months was 37.6%, 31.4%, 32.3%, 31.8%, and 33.1% for patients with private, unknown, Medicare, uninsured, and Medicaid payer status, respectively. All factors investigated were found to be significant predictors of AML survival except distance traveled. Conclusion: We observed that payer status has a statistically significant relationship with overall survival from AML."

Using the 1997 Balanced Budget Act (BBA) as an experiment, we compare long-run trends in 30-day readmission across hospitals with different amount of payment cuts. Research Design, Subjects, and Measures: Using 100% Medicare claims between 1995 and 2011 and instrumental variable hospital fixed-effects regression models, we compared changes in 30-day readmission trends for 5 leading Medicare conditions between urban hospitals facing small, moderate, and large BBA payment reductions across 4 periods [1995-1997 (pre-BBA period), 1998-2000, 2001-2005, 2006-2001]. Patient sample includes Medicare patients who were admitted to general, acute, urban, short-stay hospitals in the United States 1995-2011. Sample size ranges from 1.4 million patients for acute myocardial infarction to 3 million for pneumonia. Results: We found that 30-day readmission trends diverged post-BBA (2001-2005) between hospitals facing small and large payment cuts, where large-cut hospitals experience slower improvement in readmission rates relative to small-cut hospitals. The gap between small-cut and large-cut hospitals readmission trend was 6% for acute myocardial infarction, 4% for congestive heart failure and pneumonia (all P<0.01) in the 2001-2005 period. The gaps between hospitals were eliminated by the 2006-2011 period as the effect of BBA naturally dissipated over time. Conclusions: Although payment-cut differences are associated with widening gaps in readmission rates across hospitals, the negative association appears to dissipate in the long run.

U.S. health care costs continue to increase, occupying 17.5% of the gross domestic product (GDP) in 2014 and surpassing $3 trillion in overall health care expenditure. Solo and independent practices face unique challenges and many are being acquired by hospitals or larger groups. This transfer of services to hospital settings is indisputably leading to an increase in the net cost to the system. Comparison of facility payments for interventional techniques in HOPD, ASC, and in-office settings shows wide variation for multiple interventional techniques. Major discrepancies in payment schedules are related to higher payments for hospitals than comparable treatments in in-office settings and ASCs. In-office procedures, which have been converted to ASC procedures, are reimbursed at as high as 1,366% higher than ASCs and 2,156% higher than in-office settings. The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) has made recommendations on avoiding the discrepancies and site-of-service differentials in in-office settings, hospital outpatient settings, and ASCs. These have not been implemented by CMS. In addition, there have been slow reductions in reimbursements over the recent years, which continue to accumulate, leading to significant reductions in payments In conclusion, equalization of site-of-service differentials will simultaneously improve reimbursement patterns for interventional pain management procedures, increase access and quality of care, and finally, reduce costs for CMS, extending Medicare solvency. © 2016, American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians.

Methods: A cross-sectional probability survey of U.S. psychiatrists was fielded during September through December 2013 by using practice-based research methods, including distribution by priority mail. Psychiatrists (N=2,800) were randomly selected from the American Medical Association Physician Masterfile, and 1,188 of the 2,615 (45%) with deliverable addresses responded. Of those, 93% (N=1,099) reported currently treating psychiatric patients, forming the sample for this study. Results: Thirty percent or more of psychiatrists reported being unable to provide or find a source for each of the following services in the past 30 days: psychotherapy, housing, supported employment, case management or assertive community treatment, and substance use treatment. Approximately 20% reported being unable to provide or find a source for inpatient treatment, psychosocial rehabilitation, generalmedical care, pharmacologic treatment, and child and adolescent treatment. Approximately half (52%) of psychiatrists reported not having enough time during patient visits, affecting 28% of patients. More than one-third (37%) reported being unable to provide enough visits tomeet patients' clinical needs, affecting 24% of patients. Conclusions: Psychiatrists reported constrained availability of a range of mental health, substance use, and general medical services. In order for the Affordable Care Act to realize the promise of increased access to care, the infrastructure for mental health and substance use treatment, workforce, and services delivery may require significant enhancement."

In 2010, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) extended eligibility for dependent coverage under private health insurance, allowing young adults to continue on family plans until age 26. The objective of this study was to analyze outof- pocket (OOP) spending as a share of total health care expenditures for young adults with behavioral health conditions before and after the implementation of the ACA dependent care provision. The study examined the population of young adults with behavioral health conditions overall and by race and ethnicity. Methods: The study analyzed 2008-2009 and 2011-2012 nationally representative data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey with zero-or-one inflated beta regression models in a difference-in-differences framework to estimate the impact of the ACA's dependent coverage expansion. OOP spending was examined as a share of total health care expenditures among young adults with behavioral health disorders. The study compared the treatment group of individuals ages 19-25 (unweighted N=1,158) with a group ages 27-29 (unweighted N=668). Results: Young adults ages 19-25 with behavioral health disorders were significantly less likely than the older group to have high levels of OOP spending after the implementation of the ACA's dependent coverage expansion. The reduction was pronounced among young adults from racial-ethnic minority groups. Conclusions: The extension of health insurance coverage to young adults with behavioral health disorders has provided them with additional financial protection, which can be important given the low incomes and high debt burden that characterize the age group."

Immigrants, as compared to non-immigrants, reported more concern about paying premiums (30 vs. 11 %, p = 0.0003) and about affording the current ED visit (38 vs. 22 %, p < 0.0001). Immigrants were also less likely to report having unpaid medical bills (24 vs. 32 %, p = 0.0079), however this difference was not present among those with any hospitalization in the past year.

The purpose of this study is to assess the effects of the ACA's payment freeze and restructuring of the bidding and payment processes on favorable risk selection in Medicare Advantage plan enrollment (objective 1) and changes in the health status of beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans over time (objective 2). Methods: We used the Medicare Health Outcome Survey baseline data (2007→2013) for analyses of the first objective (7 cohorts, 1.7 million beneficiaries) and the linked baseline and follow-up data (2007-2009→2011-2013) for analyses of the second objective (5 cohorts, 0.5 million beneficiaries). To examine favorable risk selection we used the following outcomes: self-rated health, falls, balance problems, falls management, frailty, and morbidity. To examine changes in beneficiary health status over time, we examined changes (over time) in these same outcomes. The focal independent variable is the policy implementation measure, which is time dependent and measures the accumulation of changes to Medicare Advantage payment policies resulting from the ACA. Multiple regression models were developed to examine the relationship between ACA implementation and outcomes of interest. Results: In terms of favorable selection, individuals enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans post-ACA have, on average, better self-rated health (b = 0.003, p < 0.01), lower odds of falls (AOR = 0.981, p < 0.001), higher odds of falls management (AOR = 1.040, p < 0.001), lower frailty risks (IRR = 0.983, p < 0.001), and lower risks of comorbidities (IRR = 0.989, p < 0.001). In terms of health status changes over time, the results indicate that in the post-ACA period, beneficiaries reported better self-rated health (b = 0.028, p < 0.001), lower odds of falls (AOR = 0.965, p < 0.001), lower odds of balance problems (AOR = 0.958, p < 0.001), lower odds of falls management (AOR = 0.981, p < 0.05), lower frailty risks (IRR = 0.944, p < 0.001), and lower risks of comorbidity (IRR = 0.986, p < 0.001) at follow up compared to the same risks at baseline.

The Affordable Care Act coupled with an ageing population, are increasing demand for health care and, in turn, RNs. Numbering 3 million, RNs comprise the largest professional occupation in health care. Therefore, the labour force participation and hours worked are of keen interest to stakeholders and policymakers. Rising demand may exacerbate nursing shortages and have important effects on costs. We estimate the impact of wages on participation and hours worked as a possible policy tool to increase nursing supply. In 2008, the RN wage had a positive and significant effect on participation and a small positive but only marginally significant effect on hours worked given participation. The latter elasticity for married females (single females) was 0.11 (0.33). Therefore, the elasticity of hours worked with respect to the nurse wage is and unlikely to have an important effect on the participation rates or hours worked of currently trained female RNs. Consequently, wage increases are unlikely to be an effective policy to increase the labour supply among the currently licensed RNs and will not relieve any short-term nursing shortage. © 2015 Taylor & Francis."

A secondary analysis of data gathered during relicensure compared the nursing workforce at an interval of one decade, with surveys in 2005 (n = 4075; 65% response rate) and in 2015 (n = 6723; 97% response rate). Findings demonstrated an increase in the proportion of nurses who reported working in ambulatory care and community settings (p = 0.001). However, there was no associated decrease in the proportion of nurses who reported working in hospitals. Among respondents who reported employment in the ambulatory care/community settings in 2005, 34.3% had a BSN or higher, a proportion that increased to 41.2% in 2015 (p = 0.010); nevertheless, the greatest proportional increase was among AD prepared nurses (34% to 48%).

Vulnerability during transfer may be exacerbated by loss of insurance. A provision of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) allows young adults (YAs) to remain on parental private insurance through age 25 years. There has been a decrease in uninsured YAs since its implementation in 2010. Little is known about whether insurance coverage of YAs with IBD has been affected. OBJECTIVE:: To determine whether proportion of uninsured YAs with IBD has changed following implementation of extended dependent eligibility under the ACA. DESIGN/METHODS:: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of hospitalized patients with IBD, identified in the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) using diagnostic codes, to estimate proportions of insurance coverage during the years 2006–2013. We compared 19–25 year olds(yo) to 2–18 and 26–35 yo, unaffected by the provision, to account for underlying trends. RESULTS:: From 2006–2010 19–25 yo had the highest proportion uninsured, peaking at 14.1% in 2010. In 2011, the proportion decreased to 10.1%, below the proportion of uninsured 26–35 yo (13.1%), remaining in this range through 2013. Private coverage increased in 2011 for 19–25 yo, remaining stable for 26–35 yo. DISCUSSION:: Previous research cited 5% uninsured among all hospitalized patients with IBD. Our study indicates a higher proportion for YAs, decreasing after the ACA. Lack of insurance increases vulnerability during transfer, but may be modifiable through policy change. Further research should analyze effects of Medicaid expansion and health care exchanges. © 2016 by European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition and North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology,"

The Compassionate Care program is a practice model designed to bridge gaps in care for the dying and is one example of a program offering concurrent care, a recent focus of evaluation though the Affordable Care Act. Concurrent care involves offering curative care alongside palliative or hospice care. Additionally, the program offers comprehensive case management and online resources to enrollees in a national health plan (Spettell et al., 2009).SI and GST are compatible and interrelated theories that provide a relevant picture of barriers to end-of-life care and a practice model that might evoke change among multiple levels of systems.

Community-Based Pediatric Palliative Care (CBPPC) provides a holistic approach to patient care that can improve their quality of life and lead to reduced costs of hospital care. This study's purpose was to analyze and report unpublished evaluation study results from 2007 that demonstrate the potential for CBPPC on Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) and hospital utilization and costs in light of the increasing national focus on the care of children with complex-medical conditions, including the Affordable Care Act's emphasis on patient-centered outcomes. Methods: A multi-method research design used primary data collected from caregivers to determine the Program's potential impact on HRQoL, and administrative data to assess the Program's potential impact on hospital utilization and costs. Caregivers (n=53) of children enrolled in the Northeast Florida CBPPC program (Community PedsCare) through the years 2002-2007 were recruited for the Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) study. Children (n=48) enrolled in the Program through years 2000-2006 were included in the utilization and cost study. Results: HRQoL was generally high, and hospital charges per child declined by $1203 for total hospital services (p=.34) and $1047 for diagnostic charges per quarter (p=0.13). Hospital length of stay decreased from 2.92 days per quarter to 1.22 days per quarter (p<.05). Conclusion: The decrease in hospital utilization and costs and the high HRQoL results indicate that CBPPC has the potential to influence important outcomes for the quality of care available for children with complex-medical conditions and their caregivers. © 2016 The Author(s)."

The law implemented comprehensive reforms designed to improve the accessibility, affordability, and quality of health care. Objectives: To review the factors influencing the decision to pursue health reform, summarize evidence on the effects of the law to date, recommend actions that could improve the health care system, and identify general lessons for public policy from the Affordable Care Act. Evidence: Analysis of publicly available data, data obtained from government agencies, and published research findings. The period examined extends from 1963 to early 2016. Findings: The Affordable Care Act has made significant progress toward solving long-standing challenges facing the US health care system related to access, affordability, and quality of care. Since the Affordable Care Act became law, the uninsured rate has declined by 43%, from 16.0% in 2010 to 9.1%in 2015, primarily because of the law's reforms. Research has documented accompanying improvements in access to care (for example, an estimated reduction in the share of nonelderly adults unable to afford care of 5.5 percentage points), financial security (for example, an estimated reduction in debts sent to collection of $600-$1000 per person gaining Medicaid coverage), and health (for example, an estimated reduction in the share of nonelderly adults reporting fair or poor health of 3.4 percentage points). The law has also begun the process of transforming health care payment systems, with an estimated 30% of traditional Medicare payments now flowing through alternative payment models like bundled payments or accountable care organizations. These and related reforms have contributed to a sustained period of slow growth in per-enrollee health care spending and improvements in health care quality. Despite this progress, major opportunities to improve the health care system remain. Conclusions and Relevance: Policy makers should build on progress made by the Affordable Care Act by continuing to implement the Health Insurance Marketplaces and delivery system reform, increasing federal financial assistance for Marketplace enrollees, introducing a public plan option in areas lacking individual market competition, and taking actions to reduce prescription drug costs. Although partisanship and special interest opposition remain, experience with the Affordable Care Act demonstrates that positive change is achievable on some of the nation's most complex challenges. © 2016 American Medical Association.

New York City continues to be a focal point of the U.S. HIV epidemic. In 2011, the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (NYC DOHMH) issued a recommendation that all HIV infected individuals should be offered antiretroviral therapy (ART) regardless of CD4 cell count or other indicators of disease progression. This policy is based in the concept of ""treatment as prevention,"" in which providing ART to people living with HIV (PLWH) greatly reduces the likelihood of HIV transmission, while also improving individual health. The ""ART for ALL"" (AFA) study was designed to inform modifications to and identify gaps in the implementation of universal ART, and specifically to help guide allocation of resources to obtain local policy goals for increasing viral suppression among PLWH who have problem substance use. Methods/Design: The AFA Study is informed by two complementary frameworks: Glasgow and colleagues' RE-AIM model, a multi-level framework developed to guide the evaluation of implementation of new policies, and Bronfrenbrenner's ecological systems model, which conceptualizes the bi-directional interplay between people and their environment. Using multi-level data and mixed methods, the primary aims of the AFA Study are to assess rates of viral load suppression, using the NYC HIV Surveillance Registry, within 12 months of HIV diagnosis with (a) yearly cohorts of high-risk-to-transmit, difficult-to-treat, substance using patients recruited from NYC Sexually Transmitted Disease clinics and a large detoxification unit and (b) yearly cohorts of all newly HIV diagnosed people in NYC. Further goals include (c) recruiting cross-sectional samples of HIV/AIDS service providers to assess ART initiation with problem substance users and d) examining geographic factors that influence rates of viral load suppression. An Implementation Collaborative Board meets regularly to guide study procedures and interpret results. Discussion: The AFA Study has the unique strength of accessing and analyzing data at multiple levels using mixed methodology, taking advantage of NYC DOHMH biomedical surveillance data. If successful, others may benefit from lessons learned to inform local and state policies to improve the health of PLWH and further reduce HIV transmission. © 2016 The Author(s)."

The purpose of this article was to examine workplace barriers and facilitators to breastfeeding in a small rural American community following the passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010. We used a qualitative research design: semi-structured interviews with major employers and low-income working breastfeeding mothers, and a focus-group with another group of employed and unemployed breastfeeding low-income mothers. While some businesses accommodate breastfeeding mothers, few actively promote breastfeeding. Lack of compliance with the new law, inadequate breastfeeding information for mothers, and lack of support from co-workers and supervisors emerged as the main barriers to successful workplace breastfeeding. To improve workplace breastfeeding support significantly there is need for authentic collaboration among maternal-child and rural health agencies and businesses in creating breastfeeding-tolerant, flexible, and forward-looking work environments that, at a minimum, satisfy the law. © Meharry Medical College."

With implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the individual market has attained a more prominent role. However, achieving accessible and affordable coverage in this market is a long-standing challenge, in large part due to the threat of adverse risk selection. New Jersey pursued comprehensive reforms beginning in the 1990s to achieve a stable, accessible, and affordable individual market. We review how adverse risk selection can pose a challenge to achieving such objectives in the individual health insurance market. We follow this discussion by describing the experience of NewJersey through three rounds of legislative reform and through the first year of the implementation of theACAcoverage provisions. While the NewJersey reforms did not require individuals to purchase coverage, its experiences with direct and indirect market subsidies and regulations guiding plan design, issuance, and rating have important implications for how the ACA may achieve its coverage goals in the absence of the controversial individual purchase mandate. © 2016 by Duke University Press."

With the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, many state AIDS Drug Assistance Programs (ADAPs) shifted their healthcare delivery model from direct medication provision to purchasing qualified health plans (QHPs). The objective of this study was to characterize the demographic and healthcare delivery factors associated with Virginia ADAP clients' QHP enrollment and to assess the relationship between QHP coverage and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) viral suppression. Methods. The cohort included persons living with HIV who were enrolled in the Virginia ADAP (n = 3933). Data were collected from 1 January 2013 through 31 December 2014. Multivariable binary logistic regression was conducted to assess for associations with QHP enrollment and between QHP coverage and viral load (VL) suppression. Results. In the cohort, 47.1% enrolled in QHPs, and enrollment varied significantly based on demographic and healthcare delivery factors. In multivariable binary logistic regression, controlling for time, age, sex, race/ethnicity, and region, factors significantly associated with achieving HIV viral suppression included QHP coverage (adjusted odds ratio, 1.346; 95% confidence interval, 1.041-1.740; P =. 02), an initially undetectable VL (2.809; 2.174-3.636; P <. 001), HIV rather than AIDS disease status (1.377; 1.049-1.808; P =. 02), and HIV clinic (P <. 001). Conclusions. QHP coverage was associated with viral suppression, an essential outcome for individuals and for public health. Promoting QHP coverage in clinics that provide care to persons living with HIV may offer a new opportunity to increase rates of viral suppression. © 2016 The Author 2016.

With limited and contradictory evidence, this study intends to assess the impact of ACA on the utilization rates and the cost burden of women's reproductive preventive service. Methods: A pre-post analysis was conducted using a nationally representative sample of females (aged 15-44 years, n = 4397) participating in the 2011-2013 National Survey of Family Growth. The utilization rates and cost burdens were compared for six services using bivariate and multivariable logistic regression models. Results: After the ACA expansion, there wasn't a significant increase in the utilization rates of birth control/prescription (33.7% vs. 30.7%), birth control counseling (17.7% vs. 16.9%), sterilization counseling (3.3% vs. 3.5%), STI counsel/test/treat (15% vs. 14.6%) and HIV screening (24.1% vs. 23.1%). Respondents paying through insurance increased after ACA, but out-of-pocket spending (cost-sharing) didn't decrease for respondents. Type of insurance was an important predictor of utilization rates with publicly insured having significantly higher Odds Ratio (OR) or likelihood of receiving birth control counseling (OR:1.71), sterilization counseling (OR:2.67), STI counsel/test/treat (OR:1.54) and HIV screening (OR:1.69) compared to privately insured. Conclusions: The early-on impact of ACA expansion on utilization rates of women's reproductive preventive services didn't appear to be significant.

Before implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) in 2014, 100 000 persons living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (PLWH) lacked healthcare coverage and relied on a safety net of Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program support, local charities, or uncompensated care (RWHAP/Uncomp) to cover visits to HIV providers. We compared HIV provider coverage before (2011-2013) versus after (first half of 2014) ACA implementation among a total of 28 374 PLWH followed up in 4 sites in Medicaid expansion states (California, Oregon, and Maryland), 4 in a state (New York) that expanded Medicaid in 2001, and 2 in nonexpansion states (Texas and Florida). Methods. Multivariate multinomial logistic models were used to assess changes in RWHAP/Uncomp, Medicaid, and private insurance coverage, using Medicare as a referent. Results. In expansion state sites, RWHAP/Uncomp coverage decreased (unadjusted, 28% before and 13% after ACA; adjusted relative risk ratio [ARRR], 0.44; 95% confidence interval [CI],. 40-.48). Medicaid coverage increased (23% and 38%; ARRR, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.70-1.94), and private coverage was unchanged (21% and 19%; 0.96;. 89-1.03). In New York sites, both RWHAP/Uncomp (20% and 19%) and Medicaid (50% and 50%) coverage were unchanged, while private coverage decreased (13% and 12%; ARRR, 0.86; 95% CI,. 80-.92). In nonexpansion state sites, RWHAP/Uncomp (57% and 52%) and Medicaid (18% and 18%) coverage were unchanged, while private coverage increased (4% and 7%; ARRR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.62-1.99). Conclusions. In expansion state sites, half of PLWH relying on RWHAP/Uncomp coverage shifted to Medicaid, while in New York and nonexpansion state sites, reliance on RWHAP/Uncomp remained constant. In the first half of 2014, the ACA did not eliminate the need for RWHAP safety net provider visit coverage. © 2016 The Author 2016.

To compare access to care and perceived health care quality by insurance type among low-income adults in 3 southern US states, before Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act. Methods. We conducted a telephone survey in 2013 of 2765 low-income US citizens, aged 19 to 64 years, in Arkansas, Kentucky, and Texas. We compared 11 measures of access and quality of care for respondents with Medicaid, private insurance, Medicare, and no insurance with adjustment for sociodemographics and health status. Results. Low-income adults with Medicaid, private insurance, and Medicare reported significantly better health care access and quality than uninsured individuals. Medicaid beneficiaries reported greater difficulty accessing specialists but less risk of high out-ofpocket spending than those with private insurance. For other outcomes, Medicaid and private coverage performed similarly. Conclusions. Low-income adults with insurance report significantly greater access and quality of care than uninsured adults, regardless of whether they have private or public insurance. Access to specialty care in Medicaid may require policy attention. Public Health Implications. Many states are still considering whether to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act and whether to pursue alternative models for coverage expansion.

Methods. We used data from the American Community Survey from 2008 to 2014 to examine changes in the percentage of nonelderly adults who were uninsured, covered by Medicaid, or covered by private health insurance. In addition to presenting overall trends by race/ethnicity, we stratified the analysis by income group and state Medicaid expansion status. Results. In 2013, 40.5% of Hispanics and 25.8% of Blacks were uninsured, compared with 14.8% of Whites. We found a larger gap in private insurance, which was partially offset by higher rates of public coverage among Blacks and Hispanics. After the main ACA provisions went into effect in 2014, coverage disparities declined slightly as the percentage of adults who were uninsured decreased by 7.1 percentage points for Hispanics, 5.1 percentage points for Blacks, and 3 percentage points for Whites. Coverage gains were greater in states that expanded Medicaid programs. Conclusions. The ACA has reduced racial/ethnic disparities in coverage, although substantial disparities remain.

Viral suppression is one of the primary public health goals for People Living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). A crucial component of this goal involves adequate access to health care, specifically anti-retroviral HIV medications. The enactment of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in 2010 raised hopes for millions of PLWHA without access to health care coverage. High cost-sharing requirements enacted by health plans place a financial burden on PLWHA who need ongoing access to these life-saving medications. Plighted with poverty, Detroit, Michigan, is a center of attention for examining the financial burden of HIV medications on PLWHA under the new health plans. From November 2014 to January 2015, monthly out-of-pocket costs and medication utilization requirements for 31 HIV medications were examined for the top 12 insurance carriers offering Qualified Health Plans on Michigan's Health Insurance Marketplace Exchange. The percentage of medications requiring quantity limits and prior authorization were calculated. The average monthly out-of-pocket cost per person ranged from $12 to $614 per medication. Three insurance carriers placed all 31 HIV medications on the highest cost-sharing tier, charging 50% coinsurance. High out-of-pocket costs and medication utilization restrictions discourage PLWHA from enrolling in health plans and threaten interrupted medication adherence, drug resistance, and increased risk of viral transmission. Health plans inflicting high costs and medication restrictions violate provisions of the ACA and undermine health care quality for PLWHA. © Copyright 2016, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2016."

Data: Medical Expenditure Panel Survey from 2006 to 2012. Study Design: Difference-in-difference regressions comparing pre-/postpolicy-outcome changes between 19- to 25-year-olds and 27- to 34-year-olds. Principal Findings: Following significant increases in 2011, insurance take-up among 19- to 25-year-olds leveled off overall in 2012. However, increases in coverage for Black young adults were higher in 2012 compared to 2011. Despite increased coverage, there is little evidence of an overall effect on health services use postmandate. Evidence points to increased doctor visits and emergency department visits among Hispanics in the first year postmandate. Conclusions: The Affordable Care Act young adult mandate led to significant gains in insurance take-up, though evidence suggests that the bulk of the gains occurred in the first year after the mandate. Gains for Black young adults appear to have picked up in 2012. © 2016 SAGE Publications."

This article addresses the long American preoccupation with negative rights rather than positive rights in health care. Positive health care rights are an exception to the overall moral range and general thrust of U.S. legal doctrine. Some positive rights to health care have arisen from U.S. Constitutional Eighth Amendment cases and federal and state laws like Medicare, Medicaid, the State Children’s Health Insurance Program, the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.

However, gaps in women's health coverage persist. Insurers often exclude health services that women are likely to need, leaving women vulnerable to higher costs and denied claims that threaten their economic security and physical health. Goal: To uncover the types and incidence of insurer exclusions that may disproportionately affect women's coverage. Method: The authors examined qualified health plans from 109 insurers across 16 states for 2014, 2015, or both years. Key findings and conclusions: Six types of services are frequently excluded from insurance coverage: treatment of conditions resulting from noncovered services, maintenance therapy, genetic testing, fetal reduction surgery, treatment of self-inflicted conditions, and preventive services not covered by law. Policy change recommendations include prohibiting variations within states' ""essential health benefits"" benchmark plans and requiring transparency and simplified language in plan documents."

This essay examines partisanship's effects on health policy and asks whether the ACA experience was an exception or the new political normal. Partisanship itself has been essential for American democracy, but American institutions were not designed to handle its current form-ideologically pure, racially sorted, closely matched parties playing by ""Gingrich rules"" before a partisan media. The new partisanship injects three far-reaching changes into national health policy: an unprecedented lack of closure, a decline in the traditional political arts of compromise and bargaining, and a failure to define and debate alternative health policies. We can get a better sense of how far partisanship reaches by turning to state health policies. The highly charged national debate has migrated into some of the states; others retain the traditional politics of compromise and problem solving.

Literature suggests that cost sharing has a deterrent effect on initiation of treatments, and can reduce utilization of ongoing treatments. Furthermore, cost sharing may be difficult for low-income populations to understand, patients often lack sufficient information to choose medical treatment, and cost sharing may be difficult to balance within the budgets of poor adults. Gaps in the literature include evidence of long-term effects of cost sharing on health and financial well-being, evidence related to effectiveness of cost sharing combined with patient education, and evidence related to targeted programs that use financial incentives for wellness.

Herein, we characterize and compare institutional index hospitalization and 30-day readmission cost following open and endovascular vascular procedures. Methods: The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database was used to identify inpatient open and endovascular procedures at a single institution, from January 2011 through June 2012. Variable and fixed costs for index hospitalization and unplanned 30-day readmissions were obtained using SAP BusinessObjects. Patient characteristics and outcome variables were analyzed using Student t tests or Wilcoxon rank-sum nonparametric tests for continuous variables and Fisher exact tests for categorical variables. Results: One thousand twenty-six inpatient procedures were included in the analysis. There were 605 (59%) open and 421 (41%) endovascular procedures with a 30-day unplanned readmission rate of 16.9% and 17.8%, respectively (P =.679). The mean index hospitalization costs for open and endovascular procedures were US$27 653 and US$23 999, respectively (P =.146). The mean costs for 30-day unplanned readmission for open and endovascular procedures were US$19 117 and US$17 887, respectively (P =.635). Among open procedures, the mean cost for patients not readmitted was US$28 321 compared to US$31 115 for those readmitted (P =.003). Among endovascular procedures, the mean cost for patients not readmitted was US$26 908 compared to US$32 262 for those readmitted (P =.028).

With the advent of the Affordable Care Act and with Medicaid expansion on the horizon, more patients will be requiring access to care. Safety net programs have been shown to provide equivalent levels of care for patients compared with non-safety net providers, and the survival of these hospitals for the disadvantaged is essential to providing quality care for this growing patient population.

Using hospitalizations for ambulatory care sensitivity (ACS) conditions as a proxy measure for PCA, this study investigated the recession’s impact on PCA for the homeless and non- homeless in four states. The State Inpatient Databases were used to identify ACS admissions. Findings from this study indicate the recession was a barrier to PCA for homeless people who were uninsured.

Variables examined included payer mix, costs of unreimbursed care, and hospital operating margin. Sensitivity analyses were conducted as well as a triple difference analysis. Effects were estimated for hospitals overall and by ownership type. Principal Findings: California insurance expansions primarily benefited for-profit hospitals, with these facilities experiencing significant decreases in self-pay patients, increases in county-covered patients, and reductions in charity care. Most models yielded no significant change in payer mix and conflicting changes in unreimbursed care for nonprofit hospitals.

In 2013, we identified STD clinics in 21 US metropolitan statistical areas with the highest rates of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention surveillance reports. Patients attending the identified STD clinics completed a total of 4364 surveys (response rate = 86.6%). Results. Nearly half of the insured patients were willing to use their health insurance. Patients covered by government insurance were more likely to be willing to use their health insurance compared with those covered by private insurance (odds ratio [OR] = 3.60; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.79, 4.65), and patients covered by their parents' insurance were less likely to be willing to use their insurance compared with those covered by private insurance (OR = 0.72; 95% CI = 0.52, 1.00).

There were 643,290 US male prisoners aged 18-64 with a chronic health condition. At release, 73% in Medicaid-expansion states would qualify for Medicaid or tax credits.

Objectives: To evaluate the effect of teledermatology on the number of Medicaid enrollees who received dermatology care and to describe which patients were most likely to be referred to teledermatology. Design, Setting, and Participants: Claims data from a large California Medicaid managed care plan that began offering teledermatology as a covered service in April 2012 were analyzed. The plan enrolled 382 801 patients in California's Central Valley, including 108 480 newly enrolled patients who obtained coverage after the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. Rates of dermatology visits by patients affiliated with primary care practices that referred patients to teledermatology and those that did not were compared. Data were collected from April 1, 2012, through December 31, 2014, and assessed from March 1 to October 15, 2015. Main Outcomes and Measures: The percentage of patients with at least 1 visit to a dermatologist (including in-person and teledermatology visits) and total visits with dermatologists (including in-person and teledermatology visits) per 1000 patients. Results: Of the 382 801 patients enrolled for at least 1 day from 2012 to 2014, 8614 (2.2%) had 1 or more visits with a dermatologist. Of all patients who visited a dermatologist, 48.5% received care via teledermatology. Among the patients newly enrolled in Medicaid, 75.7% (1474 of 1947) of those who visited a dermatologist received care via teledermatology. Primary care practices that engaged in teledermatology had a 63.8% increase in the fraction of patients visiting a dermatologist (vs 20.5%in other practices; P < .01). Compared with in-person dermatology, teledermatology served more patients younger vs older than 17 years (2600 of 4427 [58.7%] vs 1404 of 4187 [33.5%]), male patients (1849 of 4427 [41.8%] vs 1526 of 4187 [36.4%]), nonwhite patients (2779 of 4188 [66.4%] vs 1844 of 3478 [53.0%]), and individuals without comorbid conditions (1795 of 2464 [72.8%] vs 1978 of 3024 [65.4%]) (P < .001 for all comparisons). Conditions managed across settings varied; teledermatology physicians were more likely to care for viral skin lesions and acne (3405 of 7287 visits [46.7%]), whereas in-person dermatologists were more likely to care for psoriasis and skin neoplasms (10 062 of 27 347 visits [36.8%]).

It is a mechanism by which buyers of health care services hold providers accountable for high-quality and cost-effective care. The objective of the study was to examine the relationship between quality of hospital care and hospital competition using the quality-quantity behavioral model of hospital behavior. The quality-quantity behavioral model of hospital behavior was used as the conceptual framework for this study. Data from the American Hospital Association database, the Hospital Compare database, and the Area Health Resources Files database were used. Multivariate regression analysis was used to examine the effect of hospital competition on patient mortality. Hospital market competition was significantly and negatively related to the 3 mortality rates. Consistent with the literature, hospitals located in more competitive markets had lower mortality rates for patients with acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, and pneumonia. The results suggest that hospitals may be more readily to compete on quality of care and patient outcomes. The findings are important because policies that seek to control and negatively influence a competitive hospital environment, such as Certificate of Need legislation, may negatively affect patient mortality rates. Therefore, policymakers should encourage the development of policies that facilitate a more competitive and transparent health care marketplace to potentially and significantly improve patient mortality.

Objective: The objective of this study is to explore the population characteristics of the remaining uninsured individuals with and without BHDs and to examine whether the factors that contribute to racial and ethnic disparities in the likelihood of being uninsured were different after the implementation of the ACA provision that extended insurance eligibility for young adults in 2010. Design: We use cross-sectional data analysis. Participants: We use a nationally representative dataset of the non-institutionalized civilian population in the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey from 2007 to 2012. Methods: We compare population characteristics of the remaining uninsured individuals ages 19–25, before and after the implementation of the ACA expansion in 2010. We use multivariate logistic regression to estimate the predictors (such as family income and English proficiency) that are associated with the likelihood of having no health insurance. We utilize the Fairlie decomposition method to examine the factors that contribute to racial (non-Latino White (White) vs. non-Latino African-American (African-American)) and ethnic (non-Latino White (White) vs. Latino) differences in the probability of being uninsured. Finally, we apply our analysis among populations with and without BHDs respectively, to examine the differences in the predictors of being uninsured between these two groups. Results: Among individuals with BHDs, after adjusting for covariates, the estimated probabilities of being uninsured for Whites were 0.21 and 0.16 pre- and post- the ACA expansion, respectively. The predicted probabilities of being uninsured for Latinos were 0.29 and 0.26 and for African-American were 0.19 and 0.17 pre- and post- the ACA expansion, respectively. The ethnic disparity between Whites and Latinos was 19 %. The racial disparity was moderate. Reductions in the uninsured rate of individuals without BHDs were observed as well. However, the ethnicity disparity remained at 19 % and the racial disparity increased by 5 %. Overall, our decomposition model explained 63–89 % of the racial and ethnic disparities in insurance coverage. The major factor associated with the ethnic disparity among those with BHDs was the immigrant status of Latinos, and the major factor associated with racial disparity was geographic location. The major factor associated with the ethnic disparity among those without BHDs included the immigrant status of Latinos, lack of English proficiency, and geographic location, whereas the major factor associated with racial disparity was family income. Discussion: Our study presents health insurance coverage trends among racial and ethnic minorities after the implementation of insurance expansion, a major provision of the ACA. It is important for policy makers to be aware of differences among the remaining uninsured as they evaluate ways to improve healthcare access and affordability. © 2016 W.

Based on the patient-centered medical home (PCMH) concept, PACT aims to improve access, continuity, coordination, and comprehensiveness using team-based care that is patient-driven and patient-centered. However, how VA should adapt PACT to meet the needs of special populations, such as women Veterans (WVs), was not considered in initial implementation guidance. WVs' numerical minority in VA healthcare settings (approximately 7-8 % of users) creates logistical challenges to delivering gender-sensitive comprehensive care. The main goal of this study is to test an evidence-based quality improvement approach (EBQI) to tailoring PACT to meet the needs of WVs, incorporating comprehensive primary care services and gender-specific care in gender-sensitive environments, thereby accelerating achievement of PACT tenets for women (Women's Health (WH)-PACT). Methods/design: EBQI is a systematic approach to developing a multilevel research-clinical partnership that engages senior organizational leaders and local quality improvement (QI) teams in adapting and implementing new care models in the context of prior evidence and local practice conditions, with researchers providing technical support, formative feedback, and practice facilitation. In a 12-site cluster randomized trial, we will evaluate WH-PACT model achievement using patient, provider, staff, and practice surveys, in addition to analyses of secondary administrative and chart-based data. We will explore impacts of receipt of WH-PACT care on quality of chronic disease care and prevention, health status, patient satisfaction and experience of care, provider experience, utilization, and costs. Using mixed methods, we will assess pre-post practice contexts; document EBQI activities undertaken in participating facilities and their relationship to provider/staff and team actions/attitudes; document WH-PACT implementation; and examine barriers/facilitators to EBQI-supported WH-PACT implementation through a combination of semi-structured interviews and monthly formative progress narratives and administrative data. Discussion: Lack of gender-sensitive comprehensive care has demonstrated consequences for the technical quality and ratings of care among WVs and may contribute to decisions to continue use or seek care elsewhere under the US Affordable Care Act. We hypothesize that tailoring PACT implementation through EBQI may improve the experience and quality of care at many levels. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02039856 © 2016 Yano et al."

Methods: We surveyed a convenience sample of 780 patients seeking care in a safety-net system who obtained Medicaid or publicly subsidized insurance after the Massachusetts reform, as well as a group of employed patients with private insurance. Results: We found that although most patients with Medicaid or publicly subsidized exchange-based plans were able to obtain assistance with applying for and choosing an insurance plan, substantial proportions of respondents experienced difficulties with the application process and with understanding coverage and cost features of plans. Conclusions: Under the Affordable Care Act, efforts to simplify the application process and reduce the complexity of plans may be warranted, particularly for vulnerable patient populations cared for by the medical safety net. © 2016 The Author(s)."

The present study evaluated the prevalence of health-care utilization (HCU) among a cohort of African American PWID in Baltimore. Data were from the 2012 Baltimore National HIV Behavioral Surveillance study. Participants were adult PWID and recruited using respondent-driven sampling (RDS). They completed a comprehensive sociobehavioral survey and voluntary HIV test with trained study interviewers. Analyses included descriptive and bivariate statistics to examine the prevalence of HCU, defined as seeing a health-care provider in the past year. Poisson regression assessed correlates of HCU. Participants were 61% male; 23% self-reported HIV seropositivity. Nearly 90% reported unemployment and/or disability; HCU prevalence was 85%. Significant negative correlates of HCU included age and higher injection frequency; positive correlates included previous incarceration and moderate financial stability. Interaction analyses showed unemployed publicly insured individuals had 30% higher HCU than unemployed and uninsured individuals (χ2 = 2.52; p &lt; .05). There is a need to improve health-care utilization among PWID. High prevalence of disability was still found, despite insurance coverage and access to care in this population. While the recent Affordable Care Act has increased health-care coverage and access, our results suggest that is only a first step to improving health outcomes among PWID; targeted intervention to integrate these individuals is still needed. 2016 Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC"

The ACA also requires that private insurance plans cover contraceptives without any out-of-pocket costs. These provisions may have led more women to start using prescription contraception. Study Design: We conducted two cross-sectional studies, collecting data from 8,062 women aged 18 to 39 in the fall 2012 and spring 2015. We examined contraceptive use patterns during both time periods. We used logistic regression to determine whether differences between the two time periods were significant, adjusting for the demographic characteristics of respondents. Results: We observed no changes in contraceptive use patterns among sexually active women. However, use of the pill nearly doubled, from 21% to 40%, among young women aged 18 to 24 who had not had sex in the last month. Many of these women cited benefits of the pill in addition to pregnancy prevention. Conclusions: It may be that the ACA has yet to affect contraceptive use patterns, and it is possible that it will do so in the future, but the evidence thus far suggests the importance of further research into contraceptive access and sources of care. © 2017 Jacobs Institute of Women's Health."

Most private health insurance was associated with employment, and job loss meant insurance loss. Private insurers refused new coverage for people with HIV infection. Medicaid, an important program for uninsured people with low income, was limited to only those in certain categories (eg, pregnant women or children), and although people who had progressed to AIDS were categorized as eligible (ie, “disabled”), those with early stage HIV disease were not. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is a landmark change in health care law in general and for people with HIV infection in particular. Its provisions offer dramatic improvements in health coverage, although a Supreme Court ruling that limited the expansion of Medicaid poses ongoing problems in some states.

For those with higher incomes, the tax credits phase out, meaning that adults in marketplace plans on average have higher premium costs than those in employer plans. The law's cost-sharing reductions are reducing deductibles. Lower-income adults in marketplace plans were less likely than higher-income adults to report having deductibles of $1,000 or more. Majorities of new marketplace enrollees and those who have changed plans since they initially obtained marketplace coverage are satisfied with the doctors participating in their plans.

This issue brief uses newly available data to understand how health insurers fared financially during the ACA's first year of full reforms. Overall, health insurers' financial performance began to show some strain in 2014, but the ACA's reinsurance program substantially buffered the negative effects for most insurers.

The association between access to Medicaid and access to urological health care, however, has not been tested to our knowledge. To test this association we performed a prospective, survey based analysis of Medicaid acceptance rates and new appointment wait times for a patient seeking urological care. This study presents baseline data collected prior to Medicaid expansion in 2014. Methods A primary cohort representing 20% of all urological surgeons in a nationwide database was surveyed using a simulated patient script. The data were collected in November 2013 prior to Medicaid expansion. The primary outcome measures were Medicaid acceptance and new patient appointment wait times. A practice level, secondary cohort was also analyzed. Results A total of 650 urological surgeons were successfully sampled in the primary cohort, of whom 271 (41.7%) did not accept any Medicaid, 205 (31.5%) accepted some but not all Medicaid and 174 (26.8%) accepted all Medicaid insurance plans. The median wait time for a new patient appointment was 18 days. Medicaid acceptance rates were similar in the secondary cohort. The percentage of urologists accepting all forms of Medicaid varied by state, ranging from 10% to 90%. Conclusions Medicaid patient access to urological care is restricted, suggesting that access to Medicaid insurance coverage may not translate into access to urological care.

Hospitals and insurance companies have opted to partner to distribute the risk and resources and increase coordination of care. OBJECTIVE: To examine the ACA’s impact on the health and wellness programs that have resulted from the joint ventures of hospitals and health plans based on the published literature. METHOD: We conducted a review of the literature to identify successful mergers and best practices of health and wellness programs. Articles published between January 2007 and January 2015 were compiled from various search engines, using the search terms “corporate,” “health and wellness program,” “health plan,” “insurance plan,” “hospital,” “joint venture,” and “vertical merger.” Publications that described consolidations or wellness programs not tied to health insurance plans were excluded. Noteworthy characteristics of these programs were summarized and tabulated. RESULTS: A total of 44 eligible articles were included in the analysis. The findings showed that despite rising healthcare costs, joint ventures prevent hospitals from trading-off quality and services for cost reductions. Administrators believed that partnering would allow the companies to meet ACA standards for improving clinical outcomes at reduced costs. Before the implementation of the ACA, some employers had wellness programs, but these were not standardized and did not need to produce measurable results. The ACA encouraged improvement of employee wellness programs by providing funding for expanded health services and by mandating quality care. Successful workplace health and wellness programs have varying components, but all include monetary incentives and documented outcomes. CONCLUSION: The concurrent growth of hospital health plans (especially those emerging from vertical mergers and partnerships) and wellness programs in the United States provides a unique opportunity for employees and patient populations to promote wellness and achieve the Triple Aim goals as initiated by CMS. © 2016, Engage Healthcare Communications, Inc.

Methods: We called 240 foot and ankle surgeons who performed total ankle arthroplasty in 8 representative states (California, Massachusetts, Ohio, New York, Florida, Georgia, Texas, and North Carolina). The caller requested an appointment for a fictitious patient to be evaluated for a total ankle arthroplasty. Each office was called 3 times to assess the responses for Medicaid, Medicare, and BlueCross. From each call, we recorded appointment success or failure and any barriers to an appointment, such as need for a referral. Results: Patients with Medicaid were less likely to receive an appointment compared to patients with Medicare (19.8% vs 92.0%, P <.0001) or BlueCross (19.8% vs 90.4%, P <.0001) and experienced more requests for referrals compared to patients with Medicare (41.9% vs 1.6%, P <.0001) or BlueCross (41.9% vs 4%, P <.0001). Waiting periods were longer for patients with Medicaid compared to those with Medicare (22.6 days vs 11.7 days, P =.004) or BlueCross (22.6 days vs 10.7 days, P =.001). Reimbursement rates did not correlate with appointment success rate or waiting period. Conclusion: Despite the passage of the PPACA, patients with Medicaid continue to have difficulty finding a surgeon who will provide care, increased need for a primary care referral, and longer waiting periods for appointments.

Working-age adults (18–64 years) with diabetes for years 2014–2017 were simulated by bootstrapping from the working-age diabetes patient sample of Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) Household Component 2011. Insurance coverage rates were separately predicted for each racial/ethnic group based on the Congressional Budgeting Office (CBO) report in 2014 and the proportions of Medicaid eligibility. Eye examination rates were weighted to national estimates and compared between racial/ethnic groups. Confidence intervals were estimated using the bootstrap percentile method. Health insurance coverage after the ACA is projected to increase from 90.23 % in 2011 to 98.33 % in 2014 among non-Hispanic Whites (NHW), reaching 98.96 % in 2017. Minorities are forecasted to have about 15 % expansion of insurance coverage from 2011 (80.65 %) to 2014 (96.00 %), reaching 97.25 % in 2017. In 2011, 63.01 % of NHW had eye examinations with forecasted increase to 65.83 % in 2014 and 66.05 % in 2017, while the eye examination rate in the minorities will increase from 55.75 % in 2011 to 59.23 % in 2014 and remain at 59.48 % in 2017. Therefore, racial disparity in eye examination rates is forecasted to persist (ranging from 6.57 % in 2017 to 6.69 % in 2016). The ACA is projected to improve the eye examination rate along with the expansion in insurance coverage. Although predicted racial/ethnic disparities will improve, some differences will persist.

Decisions by state officials vary from full state involvement to partial involvement to refusal to administer a state health exchange or expand Medicaid. The federal government administers a health exchange in those states choosing not to operate an exchange. The article examines whether variation in state program choices affects citizen decisions to enroll in an exchange. Also examined is whether health insurance premiums vary by which level of government administers the exchange.

Methods Cross-sectional study of a national administrative data set of privately insured young adult (18–30 years) beneficiaries hospitalized from January 2012 to June 2013. The most prevalent diagnosis categories for young adult hospitalizations are presented as percentages of all young adult hospitalizations by gender and age group (18–21, 22–25, and 26–30 years). Mean and median out-of-pocket costs by diagnosis category and gender are calculated based on deductible, copay and coinsurance payments. Results We analyzed 158,777 hospitalizations among 4.7 million young adult beneficiaries; young adults accounted for 18.3% of privately insured hospitalizations across all ages. Top diagnoses for young adult female hospitalizations were pregnancy related (71.9%) and mental illness (8.9%). Top diagnoses for young adult male hospitalizations were mental illness (39.3%) and injuries and poisoning (14.0%). Mean and median total out-of-pocket costs for any young adult hospitalization were $1,034 and $700, respectively (mean deductible payment = $411). The most expensive out-of-pocket hospitalizations were for dermatologic diseases (e.g., skin infections) with means of $1,306 for females and $1,287 for males. Conclusions This study establishes a baseline for the ongoing assessment of the most common and costly hospitalizations among privately insured young adults in the United States under the Affordable Care Act. The substantial burden of potentially avoidable hospitalizations (e.g., mental health, injury, and poisonings) supports resource allocation to improve outpatient services, mental health access, and public health prevention strategies for young adults. © 2016 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine"

To examine changes in HIV-positive patient enrollment in a large healthv care delivery system before and after key Affordable Care Act (ACA) provisions went into effect in 2014. Methods. Analyses compared HIV-positive patients newly enrolled in Kaiser Permanente Northern California between January and June 2012 (n = 339) to those newly enrolled between January and June 2014 through the California insurance exchange or via other mechanisms (n = 549). Results. After the ACA, the HIV-positive patient enrollment increased. These new enrollees were more likely to be male (93.6% vs 89.1%; P = .01), to be enrolled in high-deductible benefit plans († $1000; 18.8% vs 5.5%; P = .01), and to have better HIV viral control (HIV RNA levels below limits of quantification 79.5% vs 73.6%; P = .05) compared with pre-ACA new enrollees. Among post-ACA new enrollees, there were more patients in the lowest and highest age groups. Post-ACA exchange enrollees (22%) were more likely to be male and to have high-deductible plans than those enrolled through other mechanisms. Conclusions. More men, higher deductibles, and better HIV viral control characterize newly enrolled HIV-positive patients after the ACA in California. Public health implications. Evolving characteristics of HIV-positive enrollees may affect HIV policy, patient care needs, and service utilization."

Study Design: Retrospective multivariate analyses. Methods: Changes in annual premiums post ACA were evaluated across subgroups of subscriber and health plan characteristics. Data was derived from databases containing information on premiums, plan benefit, and demographics for subscribers aged 18 to 64 years within Kaiser Permanente of the Mid-Atlantic States. A linear regression model was used to examine the independent association between subscriber and health plan characteristics on the relative change in premiums. Results: In 2013, 4169 nongroup subscribers were enrolled in plans that were cancelled as a result of the ACA. The median pre-ACA premium was $3240 (range = $780-$39,492), which increased by a median of 21.3% (range = -77.4% to 193.6%), or $685 (range = -$27,464 to $8676), post ACA in 2014. Premiums increased more for high-deductible plans (median = 63.7%) than standard-deductible plans (median = 8.4%). Due to shifts in the age curve, premiums decreased for more than half of women aged 18 to 44 years, but increased by 35.2% for women aged 55 to 64 years. Premiums fell by 15.5% for subscribers who did not pass standard medical underwriting due to preexisting conditions. Conclusions: Changes in premiums in the nongroup market post ACA, varied substantially across subgroups, primarily due to differences in the amount of coverage, changes in rating criteria, shifts in the age curve, and anticipated differences in risk selection and composition of the risk pool. Given the extent of this variation, it would be incorrect to conclude the ACA as being uniformly beneficial or detrimental to subscribers of these cancelled plans. © 2016, Ascend Media.

In this study, we quantified the association between vulnerable hospitals and readmissions and examined the respective contributions of patient- and hospital-related factors. Methods A total of 110,857 patients who underwent major cancer operations were identified from the 2004-2011 State Inpatient Database of California. Vulnerable hospitals were defined as either self-identified safety net hospitals (SNHs) or hospitals with a high percentage of Medicaid patients (high Medicaid hospitals [HMHs]). We used multivariable logistic regression to determine the association between vulnerable hospitals and readmission. Patient and hospital contributions to the elevation in odds of readmission were assessed by comparing estimates from models with different subsets of predictors. Results Of the 355 hospitals, 13 were SNHs and 31 were HMHs. After adjusting for Hospital Readmission Reduction Program variables, SNHs had higher 30-day (odds ratio [OR] = 1.32; 95% CI, 1.18-1.47), 90-day (OR = 1.28; 95% CI, 1.18-1.38), and repeated readmissions (OR = 1.33; 95% CI, 1.18-1.49); HMHs also had higher 30-day (OR = 1.18; 95% CI, 1.05-1.32), 90-day (OR = 1.28; 95% CI, 1.16-1.42), and repeated readmissions (OR = 1.24; 95% CI, 1.01-1.54). Compared with patient characteristics, hospital factors accounted for a larger proportion of the increase in odds of readmission among SNHs (60% to 93% vs 24% to 39%), but a smaller proportion among HMHs (9% to 15% vs 60% to 115%). Conclusions Vulnerable status of hospitals is associated with higher readmission rates after major cancer surgery.

We hypothesized in advance of beginning data collection that states that expanded Medicaid (""expansion states"") under the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act would experience a reduced rate of ED closure compared with states that did not. Methods We compiled a national census of EDs from 2006 through 2013 from federal databases and manually confirmed each closure. We used difference-in-differences regression on this longitudinal panel to compare the probability over time that a hospital was in operation in expansion states to nonexpansion states. Results The number of hospitals grew every year nationally and in nonexpansion states. In expansion states, the number fell from 2027 in 2009 to 2019 in 2010, not surpassing the 2009 peak until 2012. In regression estimates, hospitals in expansion states were 2.2% (95% confidence interval, 0.3%-4.1%) less likely to be in operation after 2010 compared with the trend in nonexpansion states.

Yet, despite the enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) (commonly known as ‘Obamacare’) in 2010, the USA is not set to provide health care coverage to all, even if and when that reform is fully implemented. This article explores this issue by asking the following question: Why was a clear commitment to universal coverage, the norm in other industrialized countries, excluded as a core objective of the PPACA and how has post-enactment politics at both the federal and the state level further shaped coverage issues? The analysis traces the issue of universal coverage prior to the debate over the PPACA, during the 2008 presidential race, and during consideration of the bill. The article then looks at the post-enactment politics of coverage, with a particular focus on how states have responded to the planned use of the Medicaid programme to expand access to care. The article concludes by discussing how an explanation of the limits of the PPACA, in terms of both its commitment to universal coverage and, more importantly, the failure to provide comprehensive health insurance to all, requires an understanding of complex institutional and policy dynamics. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd"

States that operate their own marketplaces posted a year-to-year enrollment gain of 8.8 percent. To maintain membership and attract new consumers, the state-based marketplaces must sponsor enrollment assistance programs and conduct consumer outreach. These marketplaces relied heavily on such efforts during the third enrollment period, despite declining funding. Goal: To learn which outreach strategies, assistance programs, and other factors marketplace officials viewed as having exerted the greatest influence on enrollment. Methods: Survey of officials representing each of the 17 state-based marketplaces (15 responses). Key findings and conclusions: The cost of coverage and low health insurance literacy pose significant barriers to enrollment for many consumers. Marketplaces sought to overcome them by encouraging consumers to obtain in-person enrollment assistance from ACA-created assistance programs and from insurance brokers, and by partnering with community organizations for outreach activities. Many marketplaces also enhanced their web portals to make them easier to navigate and to give consumers better tools with which to evaluate their coverage options."

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (commonly known as ‘Obamacare’) successfully passed in March 2010 in the context of the economic crisis. We argue that the strategic framing of the economic crisis, through reasoning and arguments linking health care reform with economic downfall, is important in understanding the successful passage of Obamacare, and that this is reflected through strategic frames in speeches delivered by the President on health care reform. Health care reform has been successful not in spite of but rather because of the economic crisis of 2008, that allowed President Obama to use a strategic frame focusing on costs and economic problems. The two main frames identified are the ‘market’ and ‘rights’ frames. President Obama's strategic frames specifically surrounding the economic and cost-containment priority of health care reform are categorized as a ‘market’ frame in this article. He used this frame until the passage of the law in 2010, when the frame shifted to ‘rights’ frames, largely portrayed through anecdotes and focused on the concept of ‘access’ to care rather than the ‘cost’ of care.

Low-income and uninsured adults in particular experience a higher burden of comorbidities, and the Medicaid expansion provision of the Affordable Care Act was designed to improve access to healthcare in this population group. However, a significant number of US states have declined expansion. The purpose of this study is to determine the distribution of low-income and uninsured adults in expanded versus non-expanded states, and evaluate the prevalence of comorbidities in both groups. Methods: Data from the 2013 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) dataset was analyzed, and Medicaid expansion status was assessed from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services report on State Medicaid and CHIP Income Eligibility Standards. Next, age adjusted mean number of comorbidities between expanded and non-expanded states was compared, with adjustment for socio-demographic differences. Results: Expanded states had a higher proportion of adults with income of at least $50,000 per year (39.6% vs. 35.5%, p < 0.01) and a lower proportion of individuals with no health insurance coverage (15.2% vs. 20.3%, p < 0.01) compared with non-expanded states. Among the uninsured, there was a higher proportion of obese (31.6% vs. 26.9%, p < 001), and higher average number of comorbidities (1.62 vs. 1.52, p < 0.01) in non-expanded states compared to expanded states. Overall, the prevalence of comorbidities was higher among BRFSS participants in states that did not expand Medicaid compared with those in expanded states. Conclusion: States without Medicaid expansion have a greater proportion of poor, uninsured adults with more chronic diseases and conditions. © 2016 Elsevier Inc."

These findings indicate that there are statistically significant associations between a variety of factors and the Taiwanese immigrants' desire to return to Taiwan for health care under the new national health insurance plan (2nd NHIA). The variables positively associated with a desire to return to Taiwan for health care include the length of domicile and residence required to receive benefits, a nostalgic desire to return to Taiwan, the lower cost of health care in Taiwan, and if the respondents had come to the USA before 1996. The negatively associated variables include having a job in the USA, having a desire to return to Taiwan to live after retirement, the language preference in communications with a doctor, and a preference about the best place to receive dental treatment.

We examine this trend using Michigan's Medicaid expansion as a case example. We explore the origins, evidence base, and possible consequences of these reforms.

Even the most cautious use of this doctrine demolishes statutes in contravention of legislative intent and without adequate justification. It does so through the imposition of an artificially restrictive framework: one that requires that courts respond to a statute's constitutional flaw by disregarding that statute either in whole or in part. In the last few years alone, this framework has flattened the Voting Rights Act, threatened the Bankruptcy Code, and nearly toppled the Affordable Care Act. Yet courts apply severability reflexively, never demanding justification for its destructive treatment. Scholars, meanwhile, assiduously debate the particulars of the severability rules without questioning whether those rules should apply in the first place. This Article, insisting that severability justify its prominent position among the tools of statutory construction, concludes that it should be abolished. Courts should replace it with a fundamentally broader inquiry into, first, the constructions of a constitutionally defective statute that would diffuse its constitutional defects, and, second, which among these options the legislature would prefer."

Asian Americans are one of the fastest growing racial/ethnic groups in the USA. The majority are foreign born and experience limited English proficiency. The role of navigators has been shown to increase enrollment rates of public insurance programs. They are trusted for their shared traditions and sense of community. By conducting culturally-targeted outreach, Cambodian, Chinese, Vietnamese, Korean, and Laotian community-based organizations were able to reach individuals for whom the percentage of uninsured is disproportionately high. They enrolled eligible Asians immigrants in coverage despite language barriers and limited health knowledge.

Disabilities can amplify their health care burdens. Objective/hypothesis Examine how US- and foreign-born working-age adults with disabilities differ in their health care spending patterns. Methods Medical Expenditures Panel Survey yearly-consolidated files (2000-2010) on working-age adults (18-64 years) with disabilities. We used three operational definitions of disability: physical, cognitive, and sensory. We examined annual total, outpatient/office-based, prescription medication, inpatient, and emergency department (ED) health expenditures. We tested bivariate logistic and linear regression models to, respectively, assess unadjusted group differences in the propensity to spend and average expenditures. Second, we used multivariable two-part models to estimate and test per-capita expenditures adjusted for predisposing, enabling, health need and behavior indicators. Results Adjusted for age and sex differences, US-born respondents with physical, cognitive, sensory spent on average $2977, $3312, and $2355 more in total compared to their foreign-born counterparts (P < 0.01). US-born spending was also higher across the four types of health care expenditures considered. Adjusting for the behavioral model factors, especially predisposing and enabling indicators, substantially reduced nativity differences in overall, outpatient/office-based and medication spending but not in inpatient and ED expenditures. Conclusions Working-age immigrants with disabilities have lower levels of health care use and expenditures compared to their US-born counterparts.

Yet uncertainties exist regarding the impact of hospice preferred practices on patient outcomes. Objective: Assess the impact of 6 hospice preferred practices and hospice organizational characteristics on hospital utilization and death using the first national data on hospice preferred practices. Design: Longitudinal cohort study (2008-2011) of Medicare beneficiaries (N=149,814) newly enrolled in a national random sample of hospices (N=577) from the National Hospice Survey (84% response rate) and followed until death. Outcome Measures: The proportion of patients at each hospice admitted to the hospital, emergency department (ED), and intensive care unit (ICU), and who died in the hospital after hospice enrollment. Results: Hospices that reported assessing patient preferences for site of death at admission had lower odds of being in the highest quartile for hospital death (AOR=0.36; 95% CI, 0.14-0.93) and ED visits (AOR=0.27; 95% CI, 0.10-0.76). Hospices that reported more frequently monitoring symptoms had lower odds of being in the highest quartile for ICU stays (AOR=0.48; 95% CI, 0.24-0.94). In adjusted analyses, a higher proportion of patients at for-profit compared with nonprofit hospices experienced a hospital admission (15.3% vs. 10.9%, P<0.001), ED visit (21.8% vs. 15.6%, P<0.001), and ICU stay (5.1% vs. 3.0%, P<0.001). Conclusions: Hospitalization of patients following hospice enrollment varies substantially across hospices. Two of the 6 preferred practices examined were associated with hospitalization rates and for-profit hospices had persistently high hospitalization rates regardless of preferred practice implementation. © 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc."

In pediatrics, the needs of both the caregiver and the pediatric patient have to be taken into account. Pediatric practices have been shifting toward a family-centered approach, although the primary drivers have not been well defined. Identifying the key patient experiences that lead to higher patient satisfaction would enable a more meaningful clinical encounter. To better understand patient experience, we examined waiting time and the elements of the physician-patient interaction in pediatric neurology. We predict that the determining factor in patient satisfaction is the physician-patient interaction. Methods and Material Patient satisfaction surveys were sent to families via mail or e-mail after their ambulatory pediatric neurology visit. The visits took place between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2014, at one of multiple locations in a children's health system spanning four states. A Likert scale was used for these surveys, and a top-box method (measuring percent of survey questions were rated 5 out of 5) was used to filter data from this database. Statistical analysis using a Pearson correlation was used for data analysis, with likelihood to recommend practice as the dependent variable. Results The five survey questions that correlated most with overall likelihood to recommend the practice were cheerfulness of practice (r = 0.79); staff working together (r = 0.76); cleanliness of practice (r = 0.70); wait time at clinic, from entering to leaving (r = 0.66); and likelihood of recommending care provider (r = 0.65). Conclusion Pediatric neurologists striving to enhance overall patient satisfaction in their practices should work toward providing an atmosphere that supports office staff cheerfulness, teamwork, and visit efficiency provided in a clean and friendly environment. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Objective: To evaluate whether the state Medicaid expansions were associated with changes in insurance coverage, access to and utilization of health care, and self-reported health. Design: Comparison of outcomes before and after the expansions in states that did and did not expand Medicaid. Setting: United States. Participants: Citizens aged 19 to 64 years with family incomes below 138% of the federal poverty level in the 2010 to 2014 National Health Interview Surveys. Measurements: Health insurance coverage (private, Medicaid, or none); improvements in coverage over the previous year; visits to physicians in general practice and specialists; hospitalizations and emergency department visits; skipped or delayed medical care; usual source of care; diagnoses of diabetes, high cholesterol, and hypertension; self-reported health; and depression. Results: In the second half of 2014, adults in expansion states experienced increased health insurance (7.4 percentage points [95% CI, 3.4 to 11.3 percentage points]) and Medicaid (10.5 percentage points [CI, 6.5 to 14.5 percentage points]) coverage and better coverage than 1 year before (7.1 percentage points [CI, 2.7 to 11.5 percentage points]) compared with adults in nonexpansion states. Medicaid expansions were associated with increased visits to physicians in general practice (6.6 percentage points [CI, 1.3 to 12.0 percentage points]), overnight hospital stays (2.4 percentage points [CI, 0.7 to 4.2 percentage points]), and rates of diagnosis of diabetes (5.2 percentage points [CI, 2.4 to 8.1 percentage points]) and high cholesterol (5.7 percentage points [CI, 2.0 to 9.4 percentage points]). Changes in other outcomes were not statistically significant. Limitation: Observational study may be susceptible to unmeasured confounders; reliance on self-reported data; limited post- ACA time frame provided information on short-term changes only. Conclusion: The ACA Medicaid expansions were associated with higher rates of insurance coverage, improved quality of coverage, increased utilization of some types of health care, and higher rates of diagnosis of chronic health conditions for lowincome adults. © 2016 American College of Physicians."

It refers to change in economic behavior when individuals are protected or insured against certain risks and losses whose costs are borne by another party. It asserts that the presence of an insurance contract increases the probability of a claim and the size of a claim. Through the US Affordable Care Act (ACA) of 2010, this study seeks to examine the validity and relevance of moral hazard in health care reform and determine how welfare losses or inefficiencies could be mitigated. Design/methodology/approach – This study is divided into three sections. The first contrasts conventional moral hazard from an emerging or alternative theory. The second analyzes moral hazard in terms of the evolution, organization, management, and marketing of health insurance in the USA. The third explains why and how salient reform measures under the ACA might induce health care consumption and production in ways that could either promote or restrict personal health and safety as well as social welfare maximization. Findings – Insurance generally induces health care (over) consumption. However, not every additional consumption, with or without adverse selection, can be considered wasteful or risky, even if it might cost insurers more in the short run. Moral hazard can generate welfare and equity gains. These gains might vary depending on which ACA provisions, insured population, covered illnesses, treatments, and services, as well as health outcomes are taken into account, and because of the relative ambiguities surrounding definitions of “health.” Actuarial risk models can nonetheless benefit from incorporating welfare and equity gains into their basic assumptions and estimations. Originality/value – This is the first study which examines the ACA in the context of the new or alternative theory of moral hazard. It suggests that containing inefficient moral hazard, and encouraging its desirable counterpart, are prime challenges in any health care reform initiative, especially as it adapts to the changing demographic and socio-economic characteristics of the insured population and regulatory landscape of health insurance in the USA. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

The purpose of this study was to examine the variables that affect total joint arthroplasty reimbursement. Along with standard economic variables, we include unique health-care variables. Given the focus on value in the Affordable Care Act, the model examines the relationship of the quality of care to total joint arthroplasty reimbursement. We hoped to find that reimbursement patterns reward quality and reflect standard economic principles. Methods: Multivariable regression was performed to identify variables that correlatewithMedicare reimbursement for total joint arthroplasty. Inpatient charge or reimbursement data on Medicare reimbursements were available for 2,750 hospitals with at least 10 discharges for uncomplicated total joint arthroplasty from the Centers for Medicare &Medicaid Services (CMS) for fiscal year 2011. Reimbursement variability was examined by using the Dartmouth Atlas to group institutions into hospital referral regions and hospital service areas. Independent variables were taken from the Dartmouth Atlas, CMS, the WWAMI (Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana, Idaho) Rural Health Research Center, and the United States Census. Results: There were 427,207 total joint arthroplasties identified, with a weighted mean reimbursement of $14,324.84 (range, $9,103 to $38,686). Nationally, the coefficient of variation for reimbursements was 0.19. The regression model accounted for 52.5% of reimbursement variation among providers. The total joint arthroplasty provider volume (p < 0.001) and patient satisfaction (p < 0.001) were negatively correlated with reimbursement. Government ownership of a hospital (p < 0.001) and higher Medicare costs (p < 0.001) correlated positively with reimbursement. Conclusions: Medicare reimbursements for total joint arthroplasty are highly variable. Greater reimbursement was associated with lower patient volume, lower patient satisfaction, a healthier patient population, and government ownership of a hospital. As value-based reimbursement provisions of the Affordable Care Act are implemented, there will be dramatic changes in total joint arthroplasty reimbursements. To meet these changes, providers should expect qualities such as high patient volume, willingness to care for sicker patient populations, patient satisfaction, safe outcomes, and procedural demand to correlate with their reimbursement. Clinical Relevance: Practicing orthopaedic surgeons and hospital administrators should be aware of discrepancies in inpatient reimbursement for total joint arthroplasty from Medicare. Furthermore, these discrepancies are not associated with typical economic factors. These findings warrant further investigation and collaboration between policymakers and providers to develop value-based reimbursement. © 2016 By the Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery, Incorporated."

This paper draws on focus group data collected to evaluate and learn from one such community effort, located in a two-state region with significant political opposition to the ACA. Specifically, the research objectives were to better understand low income consumers’ experiences with ACA marketplaces during the initial sign–up period, both barriers and facilitators, and to learn what improvements they recommend for future outreach efforts. Focus group results show very limited knowledge of basic insurance concepts as well as the ACA. Participants reported numerous technological and related access barriers, which further complicated sign–up and caused them to lose confidence and become suspicious of the process. When asked how best to provide information and assistance to individuals such as themselves, participants pointed to several reasons conventional outreach might not be effective and suggested alternative strategies. Although public attention has focused on technical aspects of ACA sign–up, our findings suggest that future obstacles for those who remain uninsured are also likely to be related to perceptions and culturally–based understandings of “Obamacare” and how insurance works.

However, not all legal residents have benefited equally. As part of a community-based participatory research (CBPR) partnership with the Marshallese community, an interpretative policy analysis research project was conducted to document Marshallese Compact of Free Association (COFA) migrants' understanding and experiences regarding the ACA and related health policies. This article is structured to allow the voice of Marshallese COFA migrants to explain their understanding and interpretation of the ACA and related polices on their health in their own words. Methods: Qualitative data was collected from 48 participants in five focus groups conducted at the local community center and three individual interviews for those unable to attend the focus groups. Marshallese community co-investigators participated throughout the research and writing process to ensure that cultural context and nuances in meaning were accurately captured and presented. Community co-investigators assisted with the development of the semi-structured interview guide, facilitated focus groups, and participated in qualitative data analysis. Results: Content analysis revealed six consistent themes across all focus groups and individual interviews that include: understanding, experiences, effect on health, relational/historical lenses, economic contribution, and pleas. Working with Marshallese community co-investigators, we selected quotations that most represented the participants' collective experiences. The Marshallese view the ACA and their lack of coverage as part of the broader relationship between the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) and the United States. The Marshallese state that they have honored the COFA relationship, and they believe the United States is failing to meet its obligations of care and support outlined in the COFA. Conclusion: While the ACA and Medicaid Expansion have reduced the national uninsured rate, Marshallese COFA migrants have not benefited equally from this policy. The lack of healthcare coverage for the Marshallese COFA migrants exacerbates the health disparities this underserved population faces. This article is an important contribution to researchers because it presents the Marshallese's interpretation of the policy, which will help inform policy makers that are working to improve Marshallese COFA migrant health. © 2016 The Author(s)."

In particular, this research addresses how enduring health disparities are understood within the larger discussion of healthcare reform. Due to the similarity of approaches favored by participants in this study and community-based philosophy, a suggestion is made for future health policy dialogue. Although Evangelical Protestants have been most likely to reject all aspects of the Affordable Care Act, in many ways the findings of this study suggest the potential for successful future health policy collaboration.

The authors examined the early impact of the ACA (before the implementation of insurance exchanges in 2014) on insurance rates in young adults with cancer, a historically underinsured group. METHODS Using National Cancer Institute Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data for 18 cancer registries, the authors examined insurance rates before (pre) (January 2007-September 2010) versus after (post) (October 2010-December 2012) dependent insurance provisions among young adults aged 18 to 29 years when diagnosed with cancer during 2007 through 2012. Using multivariate generalized mixed effect models, the authors conducted difference-in-differences analysis to examine changes in overall and Medicaid insurance after the ACA among young adults who were eligible (those aged 18-25 years) and ineligible (those aged 26-29 years) for policy changes. RESULTS Among 39,632 young adult cancer survivors, the authors found an increase in overall insurance rates in those aged 18 to 25 years after the dependent provisions (83.5% for pre-ACA vs 85.4% for post-ACA; P<.01), but not among individuals aged 26 to 29 years (83.4% for pre-ACA vs 82.9% for post-ACA; P =.38). After adjusting for patient sociodemographics and cancer characteristics, the authors found that those aged 18 to 25 years had a 3.1% increase in being insured compared with individuals aged 26 to 29 years (P<.01); however, there were no significant changes noted in Medicaid enrollment (P =.17). CONCLUSIONS The findings of the current study identify an increase in insurance rates for young adults aged 18 to 25 years compared with those aged 26 to 29 years (1.9% vs -0.5%) that was not due to increases in Medicaid enrollment, thereby demonstrating a positive impact of the ACA dependent care provisions on insurance rates in this population. © 2016 American Cancer Society."

Obstetrics is a huge cost to the U.S. healthcare system. Maternal-infant care represents the largest single category of hospital expenditures for most commercial health plans and state Medicaid programs. Reducing these costs provides a major opportunity to reduce insurance premiums for employers and to make Medicaid coverage more affordable. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2012) encourages the State contracts with Accountable Care Organizations (ACO) by transforming traditional fee-for-service contracts into bundled contracts paying providers and facilities in a single fee. It is then the role of the physician, hospital, or institution to develop strategies to cut costs, improve outcomes, collect, tabulate and report results, and to be competitive within the new reality of the ACO. An attempt is made to develop a theoretical model to assist institutions in moving forward with the Affordable Care Act, by introducing strategies for a self-sustaining obstetric ACO in the following clusters: (1) cost containment, (2) combating stereotype, (3) medical recording, and (4) revenue enhancement. We conclude, that trends in relatively low costs care by both providers and patients are potent with hidden or adverse expenses and remedies. Self-sustained ACO in obstetrics are feasible when stemmed of well-developed patient-centered policies and screening protocols that balance the input–output ratio favoring the patient.

Uninsured patients contribute significantly to the burden of trauma center costs. The Affordable Care Act implemented changes in 2014 to provide health care coverage for all Americans. This study analyzes the impact of the recent health care changes on an Ohio Level I trauma center financials. METHODS: We conducted an analysis of trauma charges, reimbursement, and supplemental payments at an Ohio Level I trauma center. A 3-year trauma patient cohort (2012-2014) was selected and grouped by reimbursement source (Medicare, Medicaid, other government, commercial, and self-pay/charity). A total of 9,655 patients were reviewed. Data were collected with the Transition Systems Inc. accounting system and analyzed with IBM SPSS Statistics 22.0. RESULTS: For trauma cases, the percentage of self-pay/charity patients decreased during the 2012 to 2014 period (15.1%, 15%, to 6.4%, respectively), while the percentage of Medicaid decreased from 2012 to 2013 followed by a large increase in 2014 (15.4%, 13.9%, to 24.3%, respectively). The percentage of commercially insured patients decreased slightly from 2012 to 2014 (34.2%, 32.3%, to 30.7%, respectively). Uninsured charges decreased notably (approximately $22.5 million and $21 million for 2012-2013 to approximately $8.6 million in 2014). Medicaid charges decreased from 2012 to 2013, followed by a rebound in 2014 ($50.7 million in 2012 to $37.3 million in 2013 to $54.3 million in 2014). The percentage of total charges for self-pay/charity decreased (9.5%, 10.1%, to 4.1%). The percentage of total charges for Medicaid increased (21.4%, 18.0%, to 25.9%). Mean Medicaid reimbursement per patient decreased ($19,000, $14,000, to $13,000). Mean reimbursement per uninsured patient did not vary significantly among years. Total hospital supplemental payments (trauma and nontrauma combined) decreased ($47.6 million, $49 million, to $39.2 million). CONCLUSION: In the first year following the changes implemented by the Affordable Care Act, our hospital saw self-pay/charity charges decrease, Medicaid charges increase, and total hospital supplemental payments decrease. In addition, there was a small, yet noteworthy, downward trend in the number of commercially insured patients. Although more data collection and analysis are needed, this initial financial evaluation of a Level I trauma center following the Affordable Care Act provides insight into insurance trends.

The humanitarian hypothesis tests whether gender differences on pro-social values, such as humanitarianism, account for the gender gap in healthcare attitudes. Second, the economic security hypothesis tests whether these gender differences emerge because of women's self-interest due to their higher levels of economic vulnerability.

The amount of medical debt by households at the 75th percentile of the income distribution was also increased. These findings show that the number of dependent children in the household was associated with medical debt for households in the middle of the income distribution. These results may be explained by the fact that those households at the lower tail of the income distribution are more likely to have public coverage, which tends to have lower cost sharing compared to those with private insurance. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York (outside the USA)."

Data Sources/Study Setting 2008-2012 American Community Survey (ACS). The sample contained California adults ages 19-64 years (n = 237,876) and children 0-18 years (n = 113,159) with incomes below 200 percent of the federal poverty level. Study Design Differences-in-differences analysis comparing public coverage, private insurance, and the uninsured rate in counties that expanded the LIHP in 2011 versus California counties not expanding during this time. Additional analyses tested for heterogeneous impacts of the LIHP and spillover effects on children. Principal Findings Compared to nonexpansion counties, public coverage for adults increased by 1.8 percentage points (p =.02) in expanding counties, while the uninsured rate declined by 2.1 percentage points (p =.01). There was no significant change in private coverage. Public coverage gains were largest for Latinos and those with limited English proficiency. The expansion produced a positive spillover effect on children's Medicaid enrollment.

It is unclear, however, how expanded coverage changes health care behavior and promotes efficient use of emergency department (ED) services. Our objective was to use population-level emergency department data to characterize any changes in diagnoses seen in ED among young adults since the implementation of the ACA dependent coverage expansion. Methods We performed a difference-in-differences analysis of 2009 to 2011 ED visits from California, Florida, and New York, using all-capture administrative data to determine how the use of ED services changed for clinical categories after the ACA provision among young adults aged 19 to 25 years compared with slightly older adults unaffected by the provision, aged 26 to 31 years. Results We analyzed a total of 10,158,254 ED visits made by 4,734,409 patients. After the implementation of the 2010 ACA provision, young adults had a relative decrease of 0.5% ED visits per 1,000 people compared with the older group. For the majority of diagnostic categories, young adults' rates and risk of visit did not change relative to that of slightly older adults after the implementation of the ACA. However, although young adults' ED visits significantly increased for mental illnesses (2.6%) and diseases of the circulatory system (eg, nonspecific chest pain) (4.8%), visits decreased for pregnancy-related diagnoses and diseases of the skin (eg, cellulitis, abscess) compared with that of the older group (3.7% and 3.1%, respectively). Conclusion Our results indicate that increased coverage has kept young adults out of the ED for specific conditions that can be cared for through access to other channels. As EDs face capacity challenges, these results are encouraging and offer insight into what could be expected under further insurance expansions from health care reform. © 2016 American College of Emergency Physicians."

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) was implemented to increase access to medical care by improving affordability. The objective of this study was to assess the impact of affordability on accessibility of medical care after implementation of PPACA. Methods: This cross-sectional study analysed data from the 2013 to 2014 National Health Interview Survey. The study included adults who experienced affordability problems. Logistic regression model, after adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics was used to assess impact of affordability on accessibility. Key findings: A total of 45 865 individuals were included in the analysis. Majority were White people, women, had some insurance, were married and attended some college. Almost 59.40% had problems paying or were unable to pay any medical care, 17.87% could not pay medical bills over time and 23.62% respondents experienced difficulties to access because of worry about cost. Odds of difficulty to access was significantly higher (OR = 3.39, 95% CI = 3.19 to 3.61) for those with affordability issues compared to those without any problem. Ability to pay off bill over time decreased the difficulty to access (OR = 0.90, 95% CI = 0.85 to 0.96). Being uninsured, female, and unmarried, having poor health status, low income could significantly decrease the odds of access. Conclusions: Lack of affordability adversely impacted accessibility of medical care even after implementation of PPACA.

Safety net programs, such as AIDS Drug Assistance Programs (ADAP) funded through the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program, which serve low-income people living with HIV, are incorporating Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act Marketplace-qualified health plans (QHPs) and helping to fund patients' participation. This changing landscape differs from state to state, and one main element contributing to the differing situations is whether a state elected to expand Medicaid. This review examines QHP enrollment of ADAP clients in Virginia, a Medicaid nonexpansion state, and explores some issues that affect people living with HIV in other Medicaid nonexpansion states. Virginia is a leader in the shift of ADAP healthcare delivery from direct medication provision to purchasing QHPs. Virginia ADAP clients accounted for approximately 2% of ADAP clients nationally, but they represent 17% of ADAP clients enrolled in QHPs nationwide. Ensuring good HIV care of the ADAP population is important to each patient's personal longevity, the public health, and the efficient use of healthcare dollars. As healthcare delivery models shift, the effects on patients and health outcomes achieved should be monitored, particularly for chronic diseases such as HIV."

The specific features of this tax on high-cost health plans--notably, the inclusion of tax-favored savings vehicles such as health savings accounts (HSAs) in the formula for determining who is subject to the tax--are designed primarily to maximize revenue and minimize coverage disruptions, not to reduce health spending. Thus, at least initially, these savings accounts, rather than enrollee cost-sharing or other plan features, are likely to be affected most by the tax as employers act to limit their HSA contributions. Because high earners are the ones benefiting most from tax-preferred accounts, the high-cost plan tax will probably be more progressive than prior analyses have suggested, while having only a modest impact on total health spending."

This financial protection has been particularly important for people with incomes above 100 percent of poverty who live in states that have not expanded Medicaid. However, a key question for policymakers is how this protection compares to Medicaid. This brief analyzes a sample of silver plans offered in the largest markets in 18 states that use the federal website for marketplace enrollment and have not expanded Medicaid eligibility. It finds that marketplace enrollees at this income level in most plans analyzed are at risk of incurring premium and out-of-pocket costs that are higher than what they would pay under Medicaid. For people with significant health needs, costs are estimated to be much higher in marketplace plans than what they would be under Medicaid."

This issue brief compares the markets for individual coverage on and off of the exchanges, using insurers' most recent projections for ACA-compliant policies. In 2016, insurers expect that less than one-fifth of ACA-compliant coverage will be sold outside of the exchanges. Insurers that sell mostly through exchanges devote a greater portion of their premium dollars to medical care than do insurers selling only off of the exchanges, because exchange insurers project lower administrative costs and lower profit margins. Premium increases on exchange plans are less than those for off-exchange plans, in large part because exchange enrollment is projected to shift to closed-network plans. Finally, initial concerns that insurers might seek to segregate higher-risk subscribers on the exchanges have not been realized."

This article draws extensively on the emerging literature on health insurance literacy and on data from participants in the Smart Choice Health Insurance™ program. The intent of the study was to understand socio-demographic and environmental variables that predict initial health insurance literacy and gains in health insurance literacy. A standardized instrument measuring health insurance literacy was used to collect the data. Multivariate analysis showed higher income consumers demonstrated greater initial health insurance literacy scores compared to middle income consumers, whereas younger, male and lower educated consumers reported lower initial health insurance literacy. After participating in the Smart Choice Health Insurance™ program, consumers who made greater gains in their health insurance literacy tended to be female, higher income, and consumers residing in states that showed supportiveness of the ACA. The findings highlight the importance of considering sociodemographic characteristics in program design and delivery, as well as how contextual issues, such as the political environment, might impact the delivery of educational efforts.

In particular, we analyzed differences in enrollment rates across urban and rural counties in 32 states served by the Federally Facilitated Marketplace. Methods: We used enrollment data from the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation of the US Department of Health and Human Services and demographic data from the American Community Survey, supplemented with other market and policy-related information. Using multivariate regression, we investigated how county-level enrollment rates are associated with demographic, market and policy-related characteristics, including rurality. Findings: Relative to an adjusted mean enrollment rate of 17.1% for large metropolitan counties, small metropolitan counties have a 2.8% lower enrollment rate and rural counties have a 2.7% lower enrollment rate. States’ decisions to expand Medicaid and to have the federal government fully manage the HIM are both negatively associated with enrollment rates. Partnership HIMs exhibit a positive association with enrollment rates as do navigator grants, but the latter relationship is only present in counties located in Medicaid expansion states. Conclusions: Enrollment rates vary by rurality, but differences are statistically significant only between large metropolitan counties and all other types of counties—small metropolitan, micropolitan, and noncore. State-level policies, particularly Medicaid expansion, have the largest association with enrollment rates among the explanatory variables examined in the model. © 2015 National Rural Health Association"

Since the early 1970’s, telecommunication technology has been explored as a means to address the cost and quality of, as well as access to, healthcare on rural reservations. This systematic review seeks to explore the use of telemedicine in rural Native American communities using the framework of cost, quality, and access as promulgated by the Affordable Care Act of 2010 and urge additional legislation to increase its use in this vulnerable population. As a systematic literature review, this study analyzes 15 peer-reviewed articles from four databases using the themes of cost, quality, and access. The theme of access was referenced most frequently in the reviewed literature, indicating that access to healthcare may be the biggest obstacle facing widespread adoption of telemedicine programs on rural Native American reservations. The use of telemedicine mitigates the costs of healthcare, which impede access to high-quality care delivery and, in some cases, deters prospective patients from accessing healthcare at all. Telemedicine offers rural Native American communities a means of accessing healthcare without incurring high costs. With attention to reimbursement policies, educational services, technological infrastructure, and culturally competent care, telemedicine has the potential to decrease costs, increase quality, and increase access to healthcare for rural Native American patients. While challenges facing the implementation of telemedicine programs exist, there is great potential for it to improve healthcare delivery in rural Native American communities. Public policy that increases funding for programs that help to expand access to healthcare for Native Americans will improve outcomes because of the increase in access. © 2016, The Author(s)."

BPCI is a contemporary 3-year experiment designed to test the applicability of episode-based payment models as a viable strategy to transform the CMS payment methodology while improving health outcomes. A summary of the 4 models being evaluated in the BPCI initiative is presented in addition to the awardee types and the number of awardees in each model. Data from one of the BPCI-designated pilot sites demonstrate that strategies do exist for successful implementation of an alternative payment model by keeping patients first while simultaneously improving coordination, alignment of care, and quality and reducing cost. Providers will need to embrace change and their areas of opportunity to gain a competitive advantage. Health-care providers, including orthopaedic surgeons, health-care professionals at post-acute care institutions, and product suppliers, all have a role in determining the strategies for success.

This study aims to review resource utilization after cholecystectomy in order to characterize patient factors associated with increased postoperative ED visits and 30-day readmissions. Methods: A total of 53,632 open and laparoscopic cholecystectomies were reviewed from July 2009 to December 2010 in a large private payer claims database. ICD-9 and CPT codes were available for each event, as well as basic demographics. Data regarding 30-day postoperative resource utilization metrics (emergency department visits and inpatient hospitalizations) were analyzed and stratified by key patient comorbidities. Differences between subgroups were evaluated with univariate and multivariable methods. Results: Of the 53,632 patients studied, 71.2 % (38,171) were female and 28.8 % (15,461) male. Resource utilization within 30 days of surgery included: 6.6 % (3538) of patients with an ED visit and 7.7 % (4103) with an inpatient hospitalization. The most common comorbidities in the study population were: hypertension, hyperlipidemia, GERD/hiatal hernia, and diabetes mellitus. Patients with heart failure, cirrhosis, and a history of MI or acute ischemic heart disease all had a significant association with postoperative ED visit and the highest likelihood of inpatient hospitalization. Angina, diabetes, and hypertension similarly increased both ED utilization and inpatient readmissions to a lesser but still significant extent. Although patients with GERD/hiatal hernia and sleep apnea had a significant association with ED use, they did not have an increased likelihood of readmission. Conclusions: Patient comorbidity indexing plays a major role in clinical risk stratification and resource utilization for cholecystectomy. These factors should be considered in bundled reimbursement packages and in the creation of preventive postoperative ambulatory strategies given their role in determining potential resource utilization in the postoperative setting. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York."

Recently, a new dimension was added to this debate by the US Supreme Court's decision in Burwell vs. Hobby Lobby et al. which effectively granted rights to freedom of conscience to private, for-profit corporations. In light of this paradigm shift, we examine one of the most contentious points within this debate, the impact of granting conscience exemptions to healthcare providers on the ability of women to enjoy their rights to reproductive autonomy. We argue that the exemptions demanded by objecting healthcare providers cannot be justified on the liberal, pluralist grounds on which they are based, and impose unjustifiable costs on both individual persons, and society as a whole. In doing so, we draw attention to a worrying trend in healthcare policy in Europe and the United States to undermine women's rights to reproductive autonomy by prioritizing the rights of ideologically motivated service providers to an unjustifiably broad form of freedom of conscience. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."

Using resource dependence and transaction cost economics to describe the theoretical advantages of hospital ownership of post-acute care facilities (PACs), we empirically test whether hospitals that own PACs experience reduced readmissions. Our findings indicate partial support for the predicted relationship between PAC ownership and readmission rates. We found that hospital ownership of a skilled-nursing facility (SNF) was related to a lower readmissions rate for some patients, while ownership of other types of PACs did not result in significant findings. Our results offer support for the theoretical advantages of ownership, however, the savings realized by ownership may not merit the ownership investment. © 2016 by Pracademics Press."

Mistaken assumptions that underlie the expansion of behavioral health care run the risk of replicating existing service disparities. Based on a review of relevant literature and numerous observational and field studies with minority populations, we identified the following three mistaken assumptions: Improvement in health care access alone will reduce disparities, current service planning addresses minority patients' preferences, and evidencebased interventions are readily available for diverse populations. We propose tailoring the provision of care to remove obstacles that minority patients face in accessing treatment, promoting innovative services that respond to patients' needs and preferences, and allowing flexibility in evidence-based practice and the expansion of the behavioral health workforce.

However, little is known about patient perceptions of the value of such reports. Objective: This study aims to identify whether vulnerable populations with type 2 diabetes perceive consumer reports as helpful in making decisions about diabetes care. Methods: We conducted a brief demographic survey and qualitative study of 18 focus groups: six each of African American, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic White consumers diagnosed with type 2 diabetes (n = 92). We analysed focus group transcripts to identify recurring themes, which were summarized and compared across population groups. Results: Participants expressed minimal interest in currently available consumer reports. They instead listed personal referrals and interpersonal interactions among the most important factors when choosing a physician. Further, in place of information to aid in physician selection, participants articulated strong desires for more basic, straightforward disease-specific information that would promote diabetes self-management. Conclusions: This study’s results call into question the value of consumer reports as defined by the ACA. Participants reported little interest in comparative provider performance data. Instead, they were more interested in information to assist in diabetes self-management.

The policy responses to specialty hospitals have alternated between payment system reforms and outright moratoriums on hospital operations including one in the recently enacted Affordable Care Act. A key issue is whether physician-owned specialty hospitals pose financial strain on the larger group of general hospitals through cream-skimming of profitable patients, yet there is no study that conducts a systematic analysis relating such selection behavior by physician-owners to financial impacts within hospital markets. The current paper takes into account heterogeneity in specialty hospital behavior and finds some evidence of their adverse impact on profit margins of competitor hospitals, especially for-profit hospitals. There is also some evidence of hospital consolidation in response to competitive pressures by specialty hospitals.

A mixed methods study design was used to examine the potential for population health improvements to occur through the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)-mandated nonprofit hospital CHNA and planning processes. Methods involved a 2-phased approach composed of (1) content analysis of 95 CHNA/implementation strategies reports and (2) interviews with key informants, consultants, and community stakeholders involved in CHNA and planning processes.

Increasing evidence in the medical literature demonstrates the population benefits of use of these methods. However, barriers to more widespread use of LARC methods persist and include educational, access, and cost barriers. With increasing insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act and more widespread, no-cost coverage of methods, more and more women are choosing intrauterine devices and the contraceptive implant.

This article describes one hospital's experience in building and maintaining an electronic PROM database for a practice of 6 board-certified orthopedic surgeons. Methods: The surgeons advocated to and worked with the hospital to contract with a joint registry database company and hire a research assistant. They implemented a standardized process for all surgical patients to fill out patient-reported outcome questionnaires at designated intervals. Results: To date, the group has collected patient-reported outcome metric data for >4500 cases. The data are frequently used in different venues at the hospital including orthopedic quality metric and research meetings. In addition, the results were used to develop an annual outcome report. The annual report is given to patients and primary care providers, and portions of it are being used in discussions with insurance carriers. Conclusion: Building an electronic database to collect PROMs is a group undertaking and requires a physician champion.

These plans are subject to regulation and paid by risk-adjusted capitation, a set of policies known as managed competition. Individual health insurance markets, however, are vulnerable to what economists describe as efficiency problems stemming from adverse selection, and Marketplaces are no exception. Health plans have incentives to discriminate against services used by people with certain chronic illnesses, including mental health conditions. Parity regulations, which dictate coverage for mental health benefits on par with medical and surgical benefits, can eliminate discrimination in coverage but redirect discrimination toward hard-to-regulate tactics from managed care such as restrictive network design and provider payment.

Methods: We used latent class analysis to categorize 14,037 SUD treatment facilities in the United States and territories included in the 2012 National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services. Latent class indicators included MH screening and diagnosis, MH support services, psychiatric medications, groups for CODs, and psychosocial approaches. Multinomial logistic regression compared facility-identified primary focus (i.e., SUD, MH, mix of SUD-MH, and general/other) and other facility characteristics across classes. Results: A four-class solution was chosen with the following classes: Comprehensive MH/COD Services (25%), MH without COD Services (25%), MH Screening Services (21%), and Limited MH Services (29%). The former two classes with co-located MH services were less likely to report a SUD-primary focus than the latter classes reporting only MH screening or Limited MH Services. Only the Comprehensive MH/COD Services class also had a high probability of providing special groups for CODs.

Dependent variables were 11 patient safety indicators (PSI) whereas independent variables included race/ethnicity and insurance status. Results: As compared with White patients, African American patients were more likely to experience pressure ulcer, postoperative hemorrhage or hematoma, and post-operative pulmonary embolism (PE) or deep vein thrombosis (DVE); Asian/Pacific Islander patients were more likely to experience pressure ulcer, post-operative PE or DVT, and two obstetric care PSIs; whereas Hispanic/Latino patients were more likely to experience post-operative physiometabolic derangement and accidental puncture/laceration.

In 2010, health plans were more likely than in 2003 to manage behavioral health care through internal arrangements and to contract for other services. Medical home initiatives were common and almost always included behavioral health, but financial incentives did not. Some plans facilitated providers' use of technology to improve care delivery, but this was not the norm. Conclusions: Health plans are key to mainstreaming and supporting delivery of high-quality behavioral health services. Since 2003, plans have made changes to support delivery of behavioral health services in the context of a rapidly changing environment."

The Open Payments program, part of the Affordable Care Act, requires public reporting of payments to physicians from industry. We sought to describe payments from industry to physicians caring for children by (1) comparing payments to pediatricians to other medical specialties, (2) determining variation in payments among pediatric subspecialties, and (3) identifying the types of payment and the products associated with payments to pediatricians. METHODS: We conducted a descriptive, cross-sectional analysis of Open Payments data from January 1 to December 31, 2014. The primary outcomes included percent of physicians receiving payments, median total pay per physician, the types of payments received, and the drugs and devices associated with payments. RESULTS: There were 9 638 825 payments to physicians, totaling $1 186 217 157. There were 244 915 payments to general pediatricians and pediatric subspecialists, totaling >$32 million. The median individual payment to general pediatricians was $14.63 (interquartile range 12-20), and median total pay per general pediatrician was $89 (interquartile range 32-186). General pediatricians accounted for 1.7% of total payments, and 0.9% of the sum of payments. Developmental pediatricians had the highest percentage of pediatric physicians receiving payment, and pediatric endocrinologists received the highest median payment. Top marketed medications were for attention-deficient/hyperactivity disorder and vaccinations. CONCLUSIONS: More than 40% of pediatricians received payments from industry in 2014, a lower percentage than family physicians or internists. There was considerable variation in physician-industry ties among the pediatric subspecialties. Most payments were associated with medications that treat attention-deficient/hyperactivity disorder and vaccinations. Copyright © 2016 by the American Academy of Pediatrics."

The BPCI program seeks to improve health-care delivery and to ultimately reduce costs by allowing providers to enter into prenegotiated payment arrangements that include financial and performance accountability for a clinical episode in which a risk-and-reward calculus must be determined. BPCI is a contemporary 3-year experiment designed to test the applicability of episode-based payment models as a viable strategy to transform the CMS payment methodology while improving health outcomes. A summary of the 4 models being evaluated in the BPCI initiative is presented in addition to the awardee types and the number of awardees in each model. Data from one of the BPCI-designated pilot sites demonstrate that strategies do exist for successful implementation of an alternative payment model by keeping patients first while simultaneously improving coordination, alignment of care, and quality and reducing cost. Providers will need to embrace change and their areas of opportunity to gain a competitive advantage. Health-care providers, including orthopaedic surgeons, health-care professionals at post-acute care institutions, and product suppliers, all have a role in determining the strategies for success. Open dialogue between CMS and awardees should be encouraged to arrive at a solution that provides opportunity for gainsharing, as this program continues to gain traction and to evolve. © 2016 by the journal of bone and joint surgery, incorporated."

Recent legislation, such as the Affordable Care Act and the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act, solidified the role of value-based payment in Medicare. Many private insurers are following Medicare's lead. Much of the policy attention has been on programs such as accountable care organizations and bundled payments; yet, value-based purchasing (VBP) or pay-for-performance, defined as providers being paid fee-for-service with payment adjustments up or down based on value metrics, remains a core element of value payment in Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act and will likely remain so for the foreseeable future. This review article summarizes the current state of VBP programs and provides analysis of the strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities for the future. Multiple inpatient and outpatient VBP programs have been implemented and evaluated; the impact of those programs has been marginal. Opportunities to enhance the performance of VBP programs include improving the quality measurement science, strengthening both the size and design of incentives, reducing health disparities, establishing broad outcome measurement, choosing appropriate comparison targets, and determining the optimal role of VBP relative to alternative payment models. VBP programs will play a significant role in healthcare delivery for years to come, and they serve as an opportunity for providers to build the infrastructure needed for value-oriented care. © 2016 American Heart Association, Inc."

Methods: Using a 5% random sample of Medicare claims from 2009 through 2012 in individuals age 70 years or older who were due for screening, we examined claims for screening mammography and screening or surveillance colonoscopy for two years prior to ACA (2009-2010) and two years post-ACA (2011-2012). Receipt of the procedures at the patient level was compared across years using generalized estimating equations. Statistical tests were two-sided. Results: Compared with 2009, we found an increase in mammography uptake during the ACA coverage period, with multivariable odds ratios (MOR) of 1.22 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.20 to 1.25, P <. 001) for 2011 and 1.17 (95% CI = 1.15 to 1.20, P <. 001) for 2012 and less change in 2010 (OR = 1.03, 95% CI = 1.01 to 1.05, P =. 01). In contrast to mammography, uptake of screening or surveillance colonoscopy decreased in 2012 (MOR = 0.95, 95% CI = 0.92 to 0.98, P =. 002) compared with 2009, with no change in 2010 (MOR = 1.01, 95% CI = 0.99 to 1.04, P =. 47) or 2011 (MOR = 1.01, 95% CI = 0.99 to 1.04, P =. 34). Other factors associated with procedure receipt included younger age and prior preventive health visits. In an analysis restricted to patients age 70 to 74 years, colonoscopy use increased slightly in 2011 but was unchanged in 2012, and the findings by year for mammography were consistent with the main analysis. Conclusions: Following ACA implementation with concomitant reduction in out-of-pocket expenditures, there was a statistically significant increment in mammography uptake but not colonoscopy.

This study examined the impact of the ACA on out-of-pocket expenses for contraceptives. Study design: Women (ages 15-44 years) with claims for any contraceptives in years 2011, 2012 and 2013 were identified from the MarketScan Commercial database. The proportions of women using contraceptives [including permanent contraceptives (PCs) and non-PCs: oral contraceptives (OCs), injectables, patches, rings, implants and intrauterine devices (IUDs)] in study years were determined, as well as changes in out-of-pocket expenses for contraceptives during 2011-2013. Demographics, including age, U.S. geographic region of residence and health plan type, were also evaluated. Results: The number of women identified with any contraceptive usage in 2011 was 2,447,316 (mean age: 27.6 years), in 2012 was 2,515,296 (mean age: 27.4 years) and in 2013 was 2,243,253 (mean age: 27.4 years). In 2011, 2012 and 2013, the proportions of women with any contraceptive usage were 26.3%, 26.2% and 26.9%, respectively. Over the three study years, mean total out-of-pocket expenses for PCs and non-PCs decreased from $298 to $82 and from $94 to $30, respectively. For non-PCs, mean total out-of-pocket expenses for OCs and IUDs decreased from $86 to $26 and from $83 to $20. Conclusions: Implementation of the ACA has saved women a substantial amount in out-of-pocket expenses for contraceptives. Implications: Mean total out-of-pocket expenses for FDA-approved contraceptives decreased approximately 70% from 2011 to 2013.

We describe a community-engaged research approach to a community health needs assessment in New Haven, Connecticut. We demonstrate that a robust community organizing approach provided unique research benefits: access to residents for data collection, reliable data, leverage for community-driven interventions, and modest improvements in behavioral risk. We make recommendations for future community-engaged efforts and workforce development, which are important for responding to increasing calls for community health needs assessments."

Three of seven measures studied rose moderately in 2016, an increase attributable in part to a shift in the mix of plans offered in the marketplaces, from plans with higher actuarial value (platinum and gold plans) to those that have less generous coverage (bronze and silver plans). Nearly 60 percent of enrollees in marketplace plans receive cost-sharing reductions as part of income-based assistance. For enrollees without cost-sharing reductions, average copayments, deductibles, and out-of-pocket limits remain considerably higher under bronze and silver plans than under employer-based plans; cost-sharing is similar in gold plans and employer plans. Marketplace plans are more likely than employer-based plans to impose a deductible for prescription drugs but no less likely to do so for primary care visits."

As a result, healthcare reform is moving in the direction of integrating care for physical and mental illness, nudging clinicians to consider medical and psychiatric comorbidity as the expectation rather than the exception. Understanding the intersections of physical and mental illness with autonomy and self-determination in a system realigning its values so fundamentally therefore becomes a top priority for clinicians. Yet Bioethics has missed opportunities to help guide clinicians through one of medicine's most ethically rich and challenging fields. Bioethics' distancing from mental illness is perhaps best explained by two overarching themes: 1) An intrinsic opposition between approaches to personhood rooted in Bioethics' early efforts to protect the competent individual from abuses in the research setting; and 2) Structural forces, such as deinstitutionalization, the Patient Rights Movement, and managed care. These two themes help explain Bioethics' relationship to mental health ethics and may also guide opportunities for rapprochement. The potential role for Bioethics may have the greatest implications for international human rights if bioethicists can re-energize an understanding of autonomy as not only free from abusive intrusions but also with rights to treatment and other fundamental necessities for restoring freedom of choice and self-determination. Bioethics thus has a great opportunity amid healthcare reform to strengthen the important role of the virtuous and humanistic care provider. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."

Statute suggests, but does not require, training in underserved settings. Residents who train in underserved settings are more likely to go on to practice in similar settings, and graduates more often than not practice near where they have trained. Objective The objective of this study was to describe and quantify federally designated clinical continuity training sites of the THCGME program. Methods Geographic locations of the training sites were collected and characterized as Health Professional Shortage Area, Medically Underserved Area, Population, or rural areas, and were compared with the distribution of Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)-funded training positions. Results More than half of the teaching health centers (57%) are located in states that are in the 4 quintiles with the lowest CMS-funded resident-to-population ratio. Of the 109 training sites identified, more than 70% are located in federally designated high-need areas. Conclusions The THCGME program is a model that funds residency training in community-based ambulatory settings. Statute suggests, but does not explicitly require, that training take place in underserved settings. Because the majority of the 109 clinical training sites of the 60 funded programs in 2014-2015 are located in federally designated underserved locations, the THCGME program deserves further study as a model to improve primary care distribution into high-need communities."

This study determined the impact of inpatient comorbidity documentation on hospital reimbursement in a female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgery group. Methods: Departmental financial records from 2011 to 2012 were reviewed. All admissions by 4 female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgeons at a tertiary referral center were collected. All DRG (Diagnosis Related Group) codes of pathological conditions specific to males, stones and nonsubspecialty issues were excluded from analysis. Using CMS (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services) reimbursement rates the effects of documenting and coding comorbidities or complications were determined. Geographic multipliers were excluded. The study objective was to determine the impact of inpatient documentation on hospital reimbursement from a urological subspecialty group. Results: Each of 4 surgeons admitted an average of 29 inpatients per year of whom 29% had a comorbidity or complication documented. Mean reimbursement was $3,486 greater for cases with versus without a coded comorbidity or complication. This resulted in an additional $31,374 of reimbursement annually per surgeon or $125,496 for the group. Conclusions: Documenting comorbidities and complications in urology patients appropriately results in a substantial increase in reimbursement. Care should be taken by urologists to accurately note comorbid medical conditions. This is especially crucial as health care reform continues and growing numbers of patients present with chronic disease while reimbursement is further scrutinized and decreased. © 2016 American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc."

Unfortunately, school-based health services today depend on an unreliable patchwork of funding. Limited state and local funds lead to extremely low nurse-to-student ratios, resulting in missed opportunities for prevention and care of asthma and other health conditions. Methods: We carried out a nonsystematic review of legal, government, private health foundation, and medical literature. Results: Many health services for asthma and other conditions provided in school settings are services typically covered by Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) when offered in other settings. However, complex reimbursement rules, questionable policy guidance establishing a ""free care rule,"" and other barriers have limited the ability of schools to seek Medicaid/CHIP reimbursement for these services. Recent legal developments may help overcome some of these barriers, and new flexibilities in Medicaid law bring opportunities for increased reimbursement of school-based health services. Conclusions: Policymakers should call on the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to abandon the ""free care rule"" and issue other guidance that would enable schools to appropriately obtain Medicaid reimbursement for nursing services. © 2016, American School Health Association."

The Medicare program will now reimburse doctors for time they spend talking with patients about end-of-life care. This is the move that Sarah Palin and other Affordable Care Act critics said would authorize government ""death panels"" to decide whether older Americans should live or die. Today virtually no one buys into Palin's death panel rhetoric. But many people do think the Medicare change is a big deal. Representative Earl Blumenauer, a Democrat from Oregon who sponsored the original ACA reimbursement proposal, lauded the Medicare provision as ""a turning point in end-of-life care."" Others are not so sure about that. After all, laws promoting advance care planning have existed for decades. The federal Patient Self-Determination Act of 1990 and the many court decisions and state laws supporting advance care planning have had relatively little impact. Similarly, legal recognition of physician orders for life-sustaining treatment as advance planning instruments have not produced the improvements that were predicted. And from a broad perspective, advance care planning is a small piece of the puzzle. The effort to improve end-of-life care must take into account the limitations of advance decision-making, as well as the overriding importance of the general standard of care for terminally ill patients. © 2016 The Hastings Center."

Objective This study used a multiyear nationally representative database to examine the association between availability of paid sick leave and frequency of emergency department (ED) use among US private sector employees. Study sample We used the National Health Interview Survey data (2012-2014). The final study sample consists of 42,460 US adults between 18 and 64 years of age and working in nongovernmental private sector. Results Our results suggest that availability of paid sick leave is significantly associated with lower likelihood of ED use, for both moderate (1-3 times/year) and repeated users (4 or more times/year). After controlling for confounding factors, respondents with paid sick leave are 14% less likely to be moderate ED users (adjusted odds ratio, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.79-0.93) and 32% less likely to be repeated ED users (adjusted odds ratio, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.50-0.91). Discussion Although expansion of health insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act has not been shown to reduce utilization of high cost health care services such as the ED, our study suggests other factors such as the availability of paid sick leave may do so, by allowing patients to seek care through other more cost-effective mechanisms (eg, primary care providers). To reduce ED utilization, health policymakers should consider alternative reforms including paid sick leave. © 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

Method: Narrative overview of the literature and policy retrieved from searches of databases, hand searches, and authoritative texts. We identified three proposed strategies to increase the geriatric mental healthcare workforce: (1) production of more geriatric mental health providers; (2) team-based care; and (3) non-licensed providers. We evaluate each in terms of challenges and potential and provide estimates of costs, policy, and practice considerations for training, employing, and supervising non-licensed mental health providers. Results: Use of non-licensed providers is key to reforms needed to allow a more older adults to access necessary mental healthcare. Licensed and non-licensed providers have achieved similar improvements for generalized anxiety disorder among patients, although non-licensed providers did so at a lower cost. Conclusion: Supervised non-licensed providers can extend the reach of licensed providers for specific mental health conditions, resulting in lower costs and increased number of patients treated. Although several barriers to implementation exist, policy and infrastructure changes that may support this type of care delivery model are emerging from reforms in financing and associated delivery initiatives created by the Affordable Care Act. © 2016, Routledge.

Methods: Nationally representative data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (2010-2012) provided data on insurance status, public health insurance eligibility, and visits to dental providers for both general dental care and orthodontic care. Results: Overall, 41.9% of US children reported an annual dental office-based visit for general (nonorthodontic) dental care. Fewer Hispanic (34.7%) and non-Latino black children (34.8%) received dental care compared to non-Hispanic whites (47.3%) and Asians (40.3%). Children living in families with the lowest income were also the least likely to have a visit (32.9%) compared to children in the highest-income families (54.7%). Among children eligible for public coverage, Medicaid-eligible children had the lowest percentage of preventive dental visits (29.2%). Socioeconomic and racial/ethnic disparities in use and expenditures for orthodontic care are much greater than those for general and preventive dental care. Average expenditures for orthodontic care were $1,823, of which 56% ($1,023) was paid out of pocket by families. Conclusions: Our findings provide a baseline assessment for examining trends in the future, especially as coverage patterns for children may change as the Affordable Care Act is implemented and the future of the State Child Health Insurance Program remains uncertain beyond 2017. © 2016, Elsevier Inc.

The 2006 Medicare Part D and the 2010 Affordable Care Act are catalysts for further growths in utilization becuase of insurance expansion effects. This research investigating the determinants of prescription drug utilization is timely, methodologically novel, and policy relevant. Differences in population health status, access to care, socioeconomics, demographics, and variations in per capita number of scripts filled at retail pharmacies across the USA justify fitting separate econometric models to county data of the states partitioned into low, medium, and high prescription drug users. Given the skewed distribution of per capita number of filled prescriptions (response variable), we fit the variance stabilizing Box-Cox power transformation regression models to 2011 county level data for investigating the correlates of prescription drug utilization separately for low, medium, and high utilization states. Maximum likelihood regression parameter estimates, including the optimal Box-Cox λ power transformations, differ across high (λ = 0.214), medium (λ = 0.942), and low (λ = 0.302) prescription drug utilization models. The estimated income elasticities of -0.634, 0.031, and -0.532 in high, medium, and low utilization models suggest that the economic behavior of prescriptions is not invariant across different utilization levels.

Methods: American Community Survey and administrative data about Medicaid and health insurance enrollment are used to estimate the number of low-income women who will be uninsured in 2017, focusing on the age ranges 21 to 64, 40 to 64, and 50 to 64. Results: Assuming that 29 states expand Medicaid (as of June 2015), the national percentage of low-income women 21 to 64 who are uninsured will fall from 32.2% in 2013 to 14.6% by 2017. Among Medicaid-expanding states, the percentage of uninsured will decrease from 28.7% to 8.0%, whereas in non-expanding states, the level will decrease from 36.9% to 23.3%. About 5.7 million women 21 to 64 and 2.6 million women 40 to 64 will remain uninsured in 2017. The size of the uninsured low-income population will remain much larger than the 659,000 women who have previously received Pap tests and 548,000 obtaining mammograms under the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program in 2013. Discussion: Even before 2014, women living in states that are not expanding Medicaid were less likely to get mammograms and Pap tests than women in expanding states. Affordable Care Act-related insurance expansions will lower financial barriers to screening and should boost overall screening rates. But disparities in insurance coverage and cancer screening across Medicaid-expanding and non-expanding states could widen.

Although the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in the United States mandates the utilization of patient portals, and usage continues to rise, their impact has not been as profound as anticipated. Objective: The objective of our case study was to evaluate how well portals convey information to patients. To demonstrate how multiple methodologies could be used to evaluate and improve the design of patient-centered portals, we conducted an in-depth evaluation of an exemplar patient-centered portal designed to promote preventive care to consumers. Methods: We used 31 critical incident patient interviews, 2 clinician focus groups, and a thematic content analysis to understand patients' and clinicians' perspectives, as well as theoretical understandings of the portal's use. Results: We gathered over 140 critical incidents, 71.8% (102/142) negative and 28.2% (40/142) positive. Positive incident categories were (1) instant medical information access, (2) clear health information, and (3) patient vigilance. Negative incident categories were (1) standardized content, (2) desire for direct communication, (3) website functionality, and (4) difficulty interpreting laboratory data. Thematic analysis of the portal's immediacy resulted in high scores in the attributes enhances understanding (18/23, 78%), personalization (18/24, 75%), and motivates behavior (17/24, 71%), but low levels of interactivity (7/24, 29%) and engagement (2/24, 8%). Two overarching themes emerged to guide portal refinements: (1) communication can be improved with directness and interactivity and (2) perceived personalization must be greater to engage patients. Conclusions: Results suggest that simple modifications, such as increased interactivity and personalized messages, can make portals customized, robust, easily accessible, and trusted information sources. © Jordan M Alpert, Alex H Krist, Rebecca A Aycock, Gary L Kreps."

However it is unknown whether the increased access to care resulted in changes to surgical use or costs. Questions/purposes: We asked the following related research questions: compared with the United States as a whole, how did the (1) number of cases (as a percentage of the overall population, to account for changes in the overall population during the time surveyed), (2) payer mix, and (3) inpatient costs for arthroplasty change in Massachusetts after introduction of health insurance reform? Methods: We analyzed the use and cost of primary THAs and TKAs in Massachusetts using the State Inpatient Database (SID) between 2002 and 2011 compared with the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) during the same years. The SID captures 100% of inpatient procedures in Massachusetts, while the NIS is a nationally representative database of inpatient procedures for the United States. The SID and NIS are publicly available data sources from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and include information regarding procedure volumes, payer mixes, and costs. Inpatient costs were defined similarly in both databases by using hospital charges and an average cost-to-charge ratio that is unique for each hospital. The incidence of arthroplasties was calculated by dividing the procedure volume by the relevant population (either for Massachusetts or the entire country) based on public data from the United States Census bureau. Results: The incidence of THAs and TKAs performed in Massachusetts increased steadily throughout the study period, and paralleled a similar increase in the United States as a whole. In Massachusetts, the incidence of THAs increased by 59% between 2002 and 2011, and the incidence of TKAs likewise increased by 80%. The trends for the incidence in total joint arthroplasties were similar to those for Massachusetts for the United States as a whole. The period of health insurance reform in Massachusetts was associated with a greater proportion of patients covered by Medicaid, Commonwealth Care, or Health Safety Net for THAs and TKAs. By 2011, universal health insurance in Massachusetts covered 2.45% of primary THAs and 2.77% of primary TKAs. Coverage for Medicaid in Massachusetts increased from 3.23% and 3.04% of THAs and TKAs in 2002 to 4.06% and 4.34% respectively in 2011. On average, Medicaid coverage was greater for TKAs in Massachusetts than across the United States during the study period. The introduction of health insurance reform had a minimal effect on the cost of total joint arthroplasties in Massachusetts. Although the costs of total joint arthroplasties in the United States were higher than those in Massachusetts, this difference narrowed substantially from 2002 to 2011, with the Massachusetts cost trending upward and the overall United States cost trending downward. Conclusions: Despite extending insurance coverage to the entire state of Massachusetts, there was little change in actual utilization trends for joint replacement. Clinical Relevance: The enactment of universal health insurance coverage in Massachusetts appears to have been a nonevent insofar as the use and cost of total hip and knee surgeries is concerned in the state. Factors other than health insurance reform appear to be driving the growth in demand for arthroplasties in Massachusetts and are likely to do so as well in the United States under the Affordable Care Act of 2010. © 2015, The Association of Bone and Joint Surgeons®."

These findings may not describe the insurance status of vulnerable, low-income Latino populations served in community health centers (CHCs) over the course of this policy change. Cross-sectional surveys also may be of limited use in describing longitudinal phenomena such as changes in health insurance status. Methods: Using electronic health record (EHR) data, we compared the insurance status of N = 42,392 low-income patients served in 23 CHCs in Oregon, by race/ethnicity and language, over a period of 6 years straddling the implementation of ACA-related Medicaid expansion on January 1, 2014. Findings: Prior to 2014, Spanish-preferring Latinos were more likely to be uninsured than English-preferring Latinos and non-Hispanic Whites. Among uninsured patients who returned for at least one visit in 2014, Spanish-preferring Latinos had the largest increase in insurance coverage rates, and all three racial/ethnic/language groups had similar rates of insurance coverage. There were no racial/ethnic/language differences between those who did and did not have visit in 2014. Conclusion: Among previously uninsured low-income patients returning to Oregon CHCs, insurance disparities were eliminated after Medicaid expansion, especially in Spanish-speaking Latinos.

Some policy analysts worry that reductions in readmissions are being achieved by keeping returning patients in observation units instead of formally readmitting them to the hospital. We examined the changes in readmission rates and stays in observation units over time for targeted and nontargeted conditions and assessed whether hospitals that had greater increases in observation-service use had greater reductions in readmissions. METHODS We compared monthly, hospital-level rates of readmission and observation-service use within 30 days after hospital discharge among Medicare elderly beneficiaries from October 2007 through May 2015. We used an interrupted time-series model to determine when trends changed and whether changes differed between targeted and nontargeted conditions. We assessed the correlation between changes in readmission rates and use of observation services after adoption of the ACA in March 2010. RESULTS We analyzed data from 3387 hospitals. From 2007 to 2015, readmission rates for targeted conditions declined from 21.5% to 17.8%, and rates for nontargeted conditions declined from 15.3% to 13.1%. Shortly after passage of the ACA, the readmission rate declined quickly, especially for targeted conditions, and then continued to fall at a slower rate after October 2012 for both targeted and nontargeted conditions. Stays in observation units for targeted conditions increased from 2.6% in 2007 to 4.7% in 2015, and rates for nontargeted conditions increased from 2.5% to 4.2%. Within hospitals, there was no significant association between changes in observation-unit stays and readmissions after implementation of the ACA. CONCLUSIONS Readmission trends are consistent with hospitals' responding to incentives to reduce readmissions, including the financial penalties for readmissions under the ACA. We did not find evidence that changes in observation-unit stays accounted for the decrease in readmissions. Copyright © 2016 Massachusetts Medical Society. All rights reserved."

One factor limiting enrollment is lack of insurance coverage, but this barrier should be reduced under the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), which includes a provision requiring coverage for clinical trial participation as of 2014. Methods To assess the number of Kansas adults aged 19-64, newly covered with health insurance for participation in oncology clinical trials as a result of the ACA, a cross sectional design using extracted data from the 2012 American Community Survey, Public Use Microdata Sample to estimate the number of individuals covered by insurance and data from the 2014 Department of Health and Human Services Health Insurance Marketplace enrollment to estimate those newly enrolled through ACA. Results In 2014, there was an estimated increase of 3% (54,397; 95% CI: 44,149-64,244) for a total of 72% (1,171,041) of Kansans aged 19 to 64 with health insurance coverage for clinical trial participation. Conclusion Three main factors limit the effectiveness of the ACA provisions in expanding clinical trial coverage: 1) 'grandfathered' self-funded employer plans not subject to state Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) regulations, 2) Medicaid coverage limits not addressed under the ACA, 3) populations that remain uninsured. Kansas saw a negligible increase in insurance coverage as a result of the ACA thus lack of insurance coverage is likely to remain a concern for cancer patients. © 2015 The Authors."

The Bridge Model is a person-centered, social work-led, interdisciplinary transitional care intervention that helps older adults safely transition from the hospital back to their homes and communities.

Methods The research team called 240 hand surgeons in 8 states (California, Massachusetts, Ohio, New York, Florida, Georgia, Texas, and North Carolina). The caller requested an appointment for her fictitious mother to be evaluated for CTS and possible surgical management through carpal tunnel release (CTR). Each office was called 3 times to assess the responses for Medicaid, Medicare, or Blue Cross Blue Shield. From each call, we recorded whether an appointment was given and whether there were barriers to an appointment, such as the need for a referral. Results Twenty percent of offices scheduled an appointment for a patient with Medicaid, compared with 89% for Medicare and 97% for Blue Cross Blue Shield. Patients with Medicaid had an easier time scheduling appointments (28% vs 13%) and experienced fewer requests for referrals (25% vs 67%) in states with expanded Medicaid eligibility. Neither Medicaid nor Medicare reimbursement for CTR was significantly correlated with the incidence of successful appointments. Although the difference in Medicaid and Medicare reimbursements for CTR was small, the appointment success incidence for Medicare was approximately 5 times higher. Conclusions Despite the passage of the Affordable Care Act, patients with Medicaid have reduced access to surgical care for CTS and more complex barriers to receiving an appointment.

Since much of the fishing industry is composed of small family-owned businesses, commercial fishermen often have to rely on the private health insurance markets. Do commercial fishermen working in more dangerous areas or with more dangerous gear mitigate their risk by purchasing health insurance? I examine the relationship between the economics of the North Carolina commercial fishing fleet and private market health insurance purchases in the two years immediately preceding the passage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) of 2010. Establishing this baseline is important, as the slow implementation of the Act's expanded coverage will take time to make meaningful impacts on commercial fishing fleets.

We hypothesize there is a large Medicaid Gap between those receiving emergency general vs complex surgery at the same hospital. Methods Using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample, 1998 to 2010, we identified high-volume pancreatectomy hospitals. We then compared the percentage of Medicaid patients receiving appendectomies vs pancreatectomies at these hospitals. Hospital characteristics associated with increased Medicaid Gap were evaluated using generalized estimating equation models. Results A total of 602 hospital-years of data from 289 high-volume pancreatectomy hospitals were included. Median percentages of Medicaid appendectomies and pancreatectomies were 12.1% (interquartile range: 5.8% to 19.8%) and 6.7% (interquartile range: 0% to 15.4%), respectively. Hospitals that performed greater than or equal to 40 pancreatic resections per year had higher odds of having significant Medicaid Gap (odds ratio 2.3, 95% confidence interval 1.1 to 5.0).

To assess longitudinal patterns of community health center (CHC) utilization and the effect of insurance discontinuity after Oregon's 2008 Medicaid expansion (the Oregon Experiment). Methods.Weconducted a retrospective cohort studywith electronic health records and Medicaid data. We divided individuals who gained Medicaid in the Oregon Experiment into those whomaintained (n = 788) or lost (n = 944) insurance coverage.We compared these groups with continuously insured (n = 921) and continuously uninsured (n = 5416) reference groups for community health center utilization rates over a 36-month period. Results. Both newly insured groups increased utilization in the first 6 months. After 6 months, use among those who maintained coverage stabilized at a level consistent with the continuously insured, whereas it returned to baseline for those who lost coverage. Conclusions. Individuals who maintained coverage through Oregon's Medicaid expansion increased long-termutilization of CHCs,whereas thosewithunstable coverage did not. Policy implications. This study predicts long-term increase in CHC utilization following Affordable Care Act Medicaid expansion and emphasizes the need for policies that support insurance retention."

For many of the state's 5 million uninsured, this decision has left them without an option for affordable health insurance. A comparison with other Southern states that have expanded Medicaid shows how this decision has left many low-income Texans less able to afford their medical bills, to pay for needed prescription drugs, and to obtain regular care for chronic conditions. These problems have been compounded by the state's opposition to outreach and enrollment assistance for many Texans who are eligible for coverage under the ACA.

Penalties for not having insurance as well as subsidies to assist low income individuals' purchase of insurance via health insurance market places do reduce the adverse selection problem in private health insurance markets and do counteract the crowding-out effect of the Medicaid expansion.

In addition, many low-income parents have gained Medicaid coverage since 2014 under the Affordable Care Act. Most of the research to date on health insurance coverage among low-income populations has focused on its effect on health care utilization and health outcomes, with much less attention to the financial protection it offers families. We review a growing body of evidence that public health insurance provides important financial benefits to low-income families. Expansions in public health insurance for low-income children and adults are associated with reduced out of pocket medical spending, increased financial stability, and improved material well-being for families. We also review the potential poverty-reducing effects of public health insurance coverage. When out of pocket medical expenses are taken into account in defining the poverty rate, Medicaid plays a significant role in decreasing poverty for many children and families. In addition, public health insurance programs connect families to other social supports such as food assistance programs that also help reduce poverty. We conclude by reviewing emerging evidence that access to public health insurance in childhood has long-term effects for health and economic outcomes in adulthood. Exposure to Medicaid and CHIP during childhood has been linked to decreased mortality and fewer chronic health conditions, better educational attainment, and less reliance on government support later in life.

Methods Hospital utilization—defined as mean length of stay (LOS, days), secondary diagnoses for birth hospitalizations, primary diagnoses for rehospitalizations, and transfer status—and costs were described among preterm/LBW infants using the 2009 Nationwide Inpatient Sample. Results Approximately 9.1 % of included hospitalizations (n = 4,167,900) were births among preterm/LBW infants; however, these birth hospitalizations accounted for 43.4 % of total costs. Rehospitalizations of all infants occurred at a rate of 5.9 % overall, but accounted for 22.6 % of total costs. This pattern was observed across all payer types. The prevalence of rehospitalizations was nearly twice as high among preterm/LBW infants covered by Medicaid (7.6 %) compared to commercially-insured infants (4.3 %). Neonatal transfers were more common among preterm/LBW infants whose deliveries and hospitalizations were covered by Medicaid (7.3 %) versus commercial insurance (6.5 %). Uninsured/self-pay preterm and LBW infants died in-hospital during the first year of life at a rate of 91 per 1000 discharges—nearly three times higher than preterm and LBW infants covered by either Medicaid (37 per 1000) or commercial insurance (32 per 1000). Conclusions When comparing preterm/LBW infants whose births were covered by Medicaid and commercial insurance, there were few differences in length of hospital stays and costs.

Using hospital-coded discharge abstracts, we constructed a readmission measure that accounts for cross-hospital variation that enables hospitals to monitor their entire inpatient populations and evaluate their readmission rates relative to national benchmarks. Methods: Multivariate logistic regressions are applied to determine which patient factors increase the odds of a readmission within 30 days and by how much. This study uses deidentified discharge abstract data from a database of approximately 15 million inpatient discharges representing 611 acute care hospitals from Premier healthcare alliance over a 2-year period (2008q4-2010q3).

Results: This study demonstrates that meaningful risk-adjusted readmission rates can be tracked in a dynamic database. The clinical conditions responsible for the index admission were the strongest predictive factor of readmissions, but factors such as age and accompanying comorbid conditions were also important. Socioeconomic factors, such as race, income, and payer status, also showed strong statistical significance in predicting readmissions.

However, patient and public engagement is also morally complex, because evidence alone is never definitive. As patients and the public engage with evidence, value conflicts will arise and must be managed to achieve trustworthy decision making. We outline value conflicts likely to emerge in the following five settings: clinical care, health care organizations, public health, the regulatory context, and among payers. Using a variety of examples, we offer suggestions about how such conflicts may be managed, including providing more opportunities for democratic deliberation and having more explicit community discussion of how to balance personal choice and community well-being, transparent discussions of cost and quality outcomes, and greater patient engagement in community-based participatory research and the governance of learning health systems. © 2016 Project HOPE- The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc."

However, there has been little research on how various measures of physician participation may reflect different elements of capacity for care within the Medicaid program and howthese distinct measures correlate with one another across states. Our objectives were to describe several alternative measures of provider participation in Medicaid using recently publicly available data, to compare state rankings across these different metrics, and to discuss potential advantages and disadvantages of each measure for research and policy purposes. Overall, we find that Medicaid participation as measured by raw percentages of physicians taking new Medicaid patients is only weakly correlated with population-based measures that account for both participation rates and the numbers of physicians per capita or physicians per Medicaid beneficiary. Participation rates for all physicians versus primary care physicians also offer different information about state-level provider capacity. Policy makers should consider multiple dimensions of provider access in assessing policy options in Medicaid, and further research is needed to evaluate the linkages between these provider-based measures and beneficiaries' perceptions of access to care in the program. © 2016 by Duke University Press."

Using both statistical modeling and case studies, we show that GOP-leaning or GOP-dominated states have been most likely to embrace the expansion when organized business support outweighs pressures from conservative networks.

METHODS Condition-specific distribution of expenditures from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, supplemented with results from the National Nursing Home Survey and other data sources, was used as the basis for allocating the Personal Health Care components of the National Health Expenditure Accounts among conditions. RESULTS Cancer care expenditures grew at an annualized rate of 2.9% from 1998 to 2012. The share of expenditures for hospital-based care declined to a low of 48% during 2007 through 2009. Professional and clinical services' shares declined substantially between 2007 to 2009 and 2010 to 2012 when the hospital share increased. Treated prevalence decreased for all payers between the first and last study periods with the exception of private payers (11.2% increase). Out-of-pocket expenditures declined to 4.7%, whereas Medicare's share increased slightly. Medication expenditures increased, notably within retail and mail order settings.

The objectives of this report are to review the rationale for home visiting; characterize the Federal Home Visiting Program; highlight the evidence of home visiting effectiveness, particularly for low income families; identify opportunities to promote coordination between medical homes and home visiting programs; and explain the critical role of research, evaluation, and quality improvement to strengthen home visiting effectiveness. Home visiting programs offer voluntary home-based services and other supports to meet the needs of vulnerable pregnant women and young families. Home visiting intends to address poverty in 2 ways. First, it promotes economic self-sufficiency directly by building parents' knowledge, skills, and motivation related to employment opportunities and by linking families with community services such as adult education and job training. Second, it mitigates the effects of poverty through direct service and community linkages to enhance parents' capacity for positive parenting and for their own health and family functioning. Home visiting has shown effectiveness in multiple domains, including family economic self-sufficiency, birth outcomes, maternal health, child health and development, and positive parenting practices. Authorized as part of the Affordable Care Act in 2010 and reauthorized in 2015, the Federal Home Visiting Program invests an unprecedented $1.9 billion in the form of grants to states to expand home visiting programs and support rigorous research. As part of the early childhood system of services, home visiting programs must coordinate with other community services and supports. Programs will be most effective when resources are used efficiently, duplication of services is avoided, and alignment and reinforcement of other providers' messages are achieved. The Federal Home Visiting Program has established 4 mechanisms of research, evaluation, and quality improvement to enhance home visiting implementation and effectiveness. © 2016 Academic Pediatric Association."

Wraparound services have the potential to foster employment among people with disabilities. Objective We use Massachusetts, which implemented health care reform in 2006, as a case study to estimate the wraparound health care expenditures and use for workers with disabilities. Methods We identified a group of employed, working-age people with disabilities whose primary health insurance is Medicare or private insurance and who use the Medicaid Buy-In Program for wraparound coverage. We analyzed claims to estimate expenditures and use. Results Wraparound expenditures averaged $427 per member per month. Community-based services for both mental and non-mental health, which are generally not covered by Medicare or private insurance, accounted for 63% of all expenditures. The number who used community-based services was low, but the expenditures were high. The majority of the remaining expenditures were for services usually covered by primary insurance including: inpatient and outpatient, pharmacy and professional services. Expenditures were higher for people with Medicare compared to private insurance. Conclusions This case study suggests that, from a total program cost perspective, wraparound demand is greatest for community-based services. From a member utilization perspective, the demand is greatest for coverage that alleviates out-of-pocket costs for services provided by primary insurance.

It is important to clarify from the patient's perspective why Medicaid enrollees who want to receive care coordination services to improve primary care utilization frequently use the ED. Methods We conducted a qualitative data analysis of patient summary reports obtained from Medicaid enrolled frequent ED users who agreed to participate in a randomized control trial (RCT) evaluating the impact of patient navigation intervention compared with standard of care on ED use and hospital admissions. We defined frequent ED users as those who used the ED four to 18 times in the past year. The study was conducted at an urban, teaching hospital ED with approximately 90,000 visits per year. The research staff conducted interviews (~30-40 minutes), regarding the patient's medical history, reasons for ED visits, health care access issues, and social distresses. The aforementioned findings were summarized in a 1- to 2-page report and presented to the RCT's project team (social worker, emergency medicine physician, primary care physician, and patient navigators) on a weekly basis to further understand the needs of this patient population. A diverse team of researchers (program staff and physicians) coded all reports and reached consensus using reflexive team analysis. We reconciled differences in code interpretations and generated themes. Results One-hundred patients enrolled in the RCT from March 2013 to February 2014, and all 100 patient summary reports were evaluated. We identified three key themes associated with Medicaid enrollee frequent ED use: 1) negative personal experiences with the healthcare system, 2) challenges associated with having low socioeconomic status, and 3) significant chronic mental and physical disease burden. Conclusions Medicaid frequent ED users engaged in receiving patient navigation services with the goal to reduce ED use and hospital admissions describe barriers that go beyond timely primary care access issues.

As a result, two taxpayers in nearly identical economic situations can face considerably different tax liabilities depending on which side of the triggering criterion they fall. The magnitude of the equity and efficiency costs associated with cliff effects is significant: cliff effects are attached to tax provisions amounting to hundreds of billions of dollars, the majority of which are targeted at low- and moderate-income taxpayers. Cliff effects have received little attention in legal academia. Prior scholarship has primarily discussed the relevant tax provisions in isolation, focusing on financial consequences on a single taxpayer or limiting analysis to taxpayers in one geographic area. This Article addresses the void in legal scholarship by first recognizing potential rationales for cliff effects and identifying situations where their definitional clarity might compensate for any equity and efficiency losses. Next, the individual and aggregate costs of cliff effects are quantified and plausible statutory alternatives are identified. This Article argues that a cliff effect based on income is necessarily problematic on both equity and efficiency grounds because it improperly penalizes taxpayers and disincentivizes the economic empowerment the associated tax provision is intended to promote. A methodology is then provided by which these costs can be compared to the potential savings provided by the bright-line rule of the cliff effect. This empirical analysis is performed on the two cliff effects of the health premium subsidy of the Affordable Care Act and finds that the cliff effects will, if unchecked, represent a misallocation of over 8.5 billion by 2025. This Article presents several options for replacing problematic cliff effects, including those in the health care subsidy. The most novel of these strategies awards a credit based on the severity of the cliff effect and ensures that no taxpayer is made worse of post-tax by virtue of earning more pre-tax income. The Article concludes by extending the analysis to cliff effects associated with state and local tax regimes and direct transfer programs."

Key to these reforms is establishing mental and substance abuse care as essential coverage, extending Medicaid eligibility and insurance parity, and protecting insurance coverage for persons with preexisting conditions and disabilities. Many provisions, including Accountable Care Organizations, health homes, and other structures, provide incentives for integrating primary care and behavioral health services and coordinating the range of services often required by persons with severe and persistent mental health conditions. Careful research and experience are required to establish the services most appropriate for primary care and effective linkage to specialty mental health services.

In the past 15 years, access to emergency contraception (EC) in the United States has increased and more women use it. Emerging data may tailor EC prescribing based on patient weight and starting other contraception. There are several EC options - oral levonorgestrel and oral ulipristal acetate and the copper intrauterine device. Ideally, women should have EC access at low or no cost. Yet, several barriers - limited patient and provider knowledge about EC, cost, EC stocking practices, and state and federal laws exempting providers from supplying EC - make it difficult to integrate this time-sensitive treatment into women's reproductive health care.

To evaluate ways in which the Affordable Care Act will likely impact the practice of critical care medicine. To describe strategies that may help health systems and providers effectively adapt to changes brought about by the Affordable Care Act. Data Sources and Synthesis: Data sources for this concise review include search results from the PubMed and Embase databases, as well as sources relevant to public policy such as the text of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and reports of the Congressional Budget Office. As all of the Affordable Care Act's provisions will not be fully implemented until 2019, we also drew upon cost, population, and utilization projections, as well as the experience of existing state-based healthcare reforms. Conclusions: The Affordable Care Act represents the furthest reaching regulatory changes in the U.S. healthcare system since the 1965 Medicare and Medicaid provisions of the Social Security Act. The Affordable Care Act aims to expand health insurance coverage to millions of Americans and place an emphasis on quality and cost-effectiveness of care. From models which link pay and performance to those which center on episodic care, the Affordable Care Act outlines sweeping changes to health systems, reimbursement structures, and the delivery of critical care. Staffing models that include daily rounding by an intensivist, palliative care integration, and expansion of the role of telemedicine in areas where intensivists are inaccessible are potential strategies that may improve quality and profitability of ICU care in the post-Affordable Care Act era. © 2016 by the Society of Critical Care Medicine and Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc."

In 2016, as many as 7 million Americans may have plans with these cost-sharing reductions. In the largest markets in the 38 states using the federal website for marketplace enrollment, the cost-sharing reductions substantially lower projected out-of-pocket costs for people who qualify for them. However, the degree to which consumers' out-of-pocket spending will fall varies by plan and how much health care they use. This is because insurers use deductibles, out-of-pocket limits, and copayments in different combinations to lower cost-sharing for eligible enrollees. In 2017, marketplace insurers will have the option of offering standard plans, which may help simplify consumers' choices and lead to more equal cost-sharing."

Using data from the 2006–2010 National Health Interview Surveys, in this study, we document the characteristics and health insurance profiles of workers with a disability and consider the extent to which these factors are correlated with the ability to access adequate and timely health care. We find significantly higher rates of reported difficulties accessing timely health care for cost-related and structural reasons among employed adults with self-reported health conditions limiting the ability to work than among their non-work-limited peers, even after controlling for personal characteristics and health insurance coverage.

These disparities were partly addressed in the United States in 2010 by passage of the Affordable Care Act. Low-and moderate-income individuals and families with incomes between 138 and 400% of the federal poverty level are eligible for insurance premium subsidies when purchasing policies on the health insurance marketplace exchanges. Since the act was passed, nearly 16.5 million Americans have gained health insurance. In 2015, the act survived what may be the last significant judicial challenge to the law: King v. Burwell. The plaintiffs challenged whether people who purchased health insurance in states that use the federal insurance marketplace HealthCare.gov, rather than a state-run marketplace, were eligible to receive insurance premium subsidies. At the time of the ruling, 34 states used the federal exchange, and as a result, nearly 7.5 million people could have lost their health insurance if the court had ruled in favor of the plaintiffs. However, in King v. Burwell, the Court ruled six to three in support of the legality of subsidies regardless of type of marketplace states use, thereby ensuring continued health insurance coverage for patients in states using the federal marketplace exchange. In 2015, the Supreme Court also heard a landmark case, Obergefell v. Hodge, in which the Court upheld the right for two people of the same sex to marry, thereby opening crucial access to both state and federal benefits and protections for same-sex couples.

Outcome measures include a global measure of self-rated mental health, the SF-12 mental component summary (MCS), the PHQ-2 screen for depression, and the Kessler index for non-specific psychological distress.RESULTS: The overall pattern of findings suggests that both age groups experienced modest improvements in a range of outcomes that captured both positive and negative mental health following the 2010 implementation of the coverage expansion. The notable exception to this pattern is a 1.4 point relative increase in the SF-12 MCS score among young adults alone, a measure that captures emotional well-being, mental health symptoms (positive and negative), and social role functioning.DISCUSSION: This study provides the first estimates of a broad range of mental health outcomes that may be responsive to changes in mental health care use and/or the increased financial security that insurance confers. For the population as a whole, there were few short-term changes in young adults' mental health outcome relative to older adults. However, the relative increase in the SF-12 score among young adults, while small, is likely meaningful at a population level given the observed effect sizes for this measure obtained in clinical trials.IMPLICATIONS: The vast majority of mental illnesses emerge before individuals reach age 24. Public policy designed to expand health insurance coverage to this population has the potential to influence mental health in a relatively short time frame.BACKGROUND: In September 2010, the Affordable Care Act increased the availability of private health insurance for young adult dependents in the United States and prohibited coverage exclusions for their pre-existing conditions. The coverage expansion improved young adults' financial protection from medical expenses and increased their mental health care use. These short-term effects signal the possibility of accompanying changes in mental health through one or more mechanisms: treatment-induced symptom relief or improved function; improved well-being and/or reduced anxiety as financial security increases; or declines in self-reported mental health if treatment results in the discovery of illnesses.AIMS: In this study, we estimate the effects of this insurance coverage expansion on young adults' mental health outcomes one year after its implementation."

Objective: To evaluate use of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening in a national population-based sample before and after implementation of the ACA. Design: Repeated cross-sectional analysis of the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) between 2009 and 2012 comparing CRC screening rates before and after implementation of the ACA. Participants: Adults 50–64 with private health insurance and adults 65–75 with Medicare. Main Measures: Self-reported receipt of screening colonoscopy, sigmoidoscopy, or fecal occult blood test (FOBT) within the past year among those eligible for screening. Key Results: Our study included 8617 adults aged 50–64 and 3761 adults aged 65–75. MEPS response rates ranged from 58 to 63%. Among adults aged 50–64, 18.9–20.9% received a colonoscopy in the survey year, 0.59–2.1% received a sigmoidoscopy, and 7.9–10.4% received an FOBT. For adults aged 65–75, 23.6–27.7% received a colonoscopy, 1.3–3.2% a sigmoidoscopy, and 13.5–16.4% an FOBT. In adjusted analyses, among participants aged 50–64, there was no increase in yearly rates of colonoscopy (−0.28 percentage points, 95% CI −2.3 to 1.7, p = 0.78), sigmoidoscopy (−1.1%, 95% CI −1.7 to −0.46, p = <0.001), or FOBT (−1.6%, 95% CI −3.2 to −0.03, p = 0.046) post-ACA. For those aged 65–75, rates of colonoscopy (+2.3%, 95% CI −1.4 to 6.0, p = 0.22), sigmoidoscopy (+0.34%, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.6, p = 0.58) and FOBT (−0.65, 95% CI −4.1 to 2.8, p = 0.72) did not increase. Among those aged 65–75 with Medicare and no additional insurance, the use of colonoscopy rose by 12.0% (95% CI 3.3 to 20.8, p = 0.007). Among participants with Medicare living in poverty, colonoscopy use also increased (+5.7%, 95% CI 0.18 to 11.3, p = 0.043).

The present study demonstrates the value of collecting data directly from deliverers of home visiting programs across a state. This study was conducted in response to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which requires states to conduct a needs assessment of home visiting programs for pregnant women and young children to receive federal funding. In this paper, we provide a descriptive analysis of a needs assessment of home visiting programs in Ohio. Methods All programs in the state that met the federal definition of home visiting were included in this study. Program staff completed a web-based survey with open- and close-ended questions covering program management, content, goals, and characteristics of the families served. Results Consistent with the research literature, program representatives reported great diversity with regard to program management, reach, eligibility, goals, content, and services delivered, yet consistently conveyed great need for home visiting services across the state. Conclusions Results demonstrate quantitative and qualitative assessments of need have direct implications for public policy.

Data were collected from organizational leaders of national samples of 307 specialty treatment centers in 2009-2012 and 372 treatment centers in 2011-2013. Notably, there was not a significant change in the percentage of organizations offering acamprosate over the study period. However, greater reliance on Medicaid and private insurance as sources of revenue was positively associated with the availability of acamprosate. In addition, acamprosate availability was positively associated with access to physicians and the presence of on-site primary medical care, while centers that placed greater emphasis on confrontational group therapy were significantly less likely to offer acamprosate for AUD treatment. To the extent that the ACA is expanding the number of insured individuals enrolled in Medicaid and commercial insurance sold through health insurance exchanges, this study suggests that the ACA may hold promise for expanding the availability of this EBP for AUD treatment. Future research is needed to measure whether this potential impact actually occurs within the specialty treatment system over time. © 2015 Elsevier Inc."

This change has led many women and their health care providers to wonder if they should abandon this annual preventive health visit altogether. Changing guidelines coinciding with expanded WWV coverage for millions of American women under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act have created confusion for health care consumers and care givers alike. Is there evidence to support continued routine preventive health visits for women and, if so, what would ideally constitute the WWV of today? Methods: A scoping review of the literature was undertaken to appraise the current state of evidence regarding a wide range of possible elements to identify priority areas for the WWV. Findings: A population health perspective taking into consideration the reproductive health needs of women as well as the preventable and modifiable leading causes of death and disability was used to identify eight domains for the WWV of today: 1) reproductive life planning and sexual health, 2) cardiovascular disease and stroke, 3) prevention, screening, and early detection of cancers, 4) unintended injury, 5) anxiety, depression, substance abuse, and suicidal intent, 6) intimate partner violence, assault, and homicide, 7) lower respiratory disease, and 8) arthritis and other musculoskeletal problems.

The implementation of the Affordable Care Act offers an historic opportunity to consider novel approaches to addressing the nation's public health concerns. We adopt an anticipatory anthropological perspective to consider lifestyle behavior change as common ground shared by practitioners of both biomedicine and common forms of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). At issue is whether CAM practitioners might play a more proactive and publicly endorsed role in delivering preventive and promotive health services to address these needs. Recognizing that this is a contentious issue, we consider two constructive roles for engaged medical anthropologists: (1) as culture brokers helping to facilitate interprofessional communities of preventive and promotive health practice and (2) in collaboration with health service researchers developing patient-near evaluations of preventive and promotive health services on patient well-being and behavior change.

Informed consumers are an important foundation of many components of the Affordable Care Act, including coverage mandates for proven clinical preventive services recommended by the US Preventive Services Task Force. Across sociodemographic groups, however, knowledge of and positive attitudes toward evidence-based guidelines for preventive care are extremely low. Given the demonstrated low levels of consumers' knowledge of and trust in guidelines, coupled with their strong preference for involvement in preventive care decisions, better education and decision-making support for evidence-based preventive services are greatly needed. Context Both the underuse and overuse of clinical preventive services are a serious public health problem. The goal of our study was to produce population-based national data that could assist in the design of communication strategies to increase knowledge of and positive attitudes toward evidence-based guidelines for clinical preventive services (including the US Preventive Services Task Force, USPSTF) and to reduce uncertainty among patients when guidelines change or are controversial. Methods In late 2013 we implemented an Internet-based survey of a nationally representative sample of 2,529 adults via KnowledgePanel, a probability-based survey panel of approximately 60,000 adults, statistically representative of the US noninstitutionalized population. African Americans, Hispanics, and those with less than a high school education were oversampled. We then conducted descriptive statistics and multivariable logistic regression analysis to identify the prevalence of and sociodemographic characteristics associated with key knowledge and attitudinal variables. Findings While 36.4% of adults reported knowing that the Affordable Care Act requires insurance companies to cover proven preventive services without cost sharing, only 7.7% had heard of the USPSTF. Approximately 1 in 3 (32.6%) reported trusting that a government task force would make fair guidelines for preventive services, and 38.2% believed that the government uses guidelines to ration health care. Most of the respondents endorsed the notion that research/scientific evidence and expert medical opinion are important for the creation of guidelines and that clinicians should follow guidelines based on evidence. But when presented with patient vignettes in which a physician made a guideline-based recommendation against a cancer-screening test, less than 10% believed that this recommendation alone, without further dialogue and/or the patient's own research, was sufficient to make such a decision.

This presents an opportunity for care improvement but also raises several concerns regarding quality of care. The readmission measure for SNFs is similar to the current readmission measure for hospitals mandated under the Affordable Care Act, with the exception of adjustments made for sex. Because these measures for hospitals are similar, lessons can be learned from implementation of the existing hospital readmission penalties. In addition, there are three specific concerns that the authors relate to implementing the proposed measure in SNFs. There is poor communication and care coordination between care settings, including posthospitalization and post-SNF care in the current healthcare system. Adding readmission penalties to SNF regulations may create perverse incentives for prolonged SNF stays. The evidence base for the best means of caring for individuals after a brief stay in a SNF needs enrichment. These challenges need to be addressed as part of implementation of these new hospital readmission penalties for SNFs to improve care and prevent new unintended consequences. © 2016, Copyright the Authors Journal compilation © 2016, The American Geriatrics Society."

This is partly not only due to new additions in the list of recommended vaccines but also due to the use of new, safer, but more expensive technologies in vaccine production and distribution. In recent years, many states have mandated that recommended childhood vaccines be covered by private health insurance companies. Currently, there are 33 states with such a mandate. In this paper, I examine whether the introduction of mandates on private insurers affected immunization rates. Using state and time variation, I find that mandates increased the immunization rate for three vaccines - the diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis, polio, and measles-mumps-rubella vaccines - by about 1.8 percentage points. These results may provide a lower bound for the expected effect of the Affordable Care Act, which mandates coverage of childhood vaccines for all private insurers in the USA. I also find evidence that the mandates shifted a significant portion of vaccinations from publicly funded sources to private ones, with a decline in public health clinic visits and an increase in vaccinations at hospitals and doctor's offices.

Study design A retrospective chart analysis of patients prescribed an intrauterine device (IUD) or an etonogestrel implant between December 2011 and July 2013 in an Appalachian private practice was performed. Of the 571 identified patients aged 13 to 50, the majority were Caucasian (98.7%) and using Medicaid (53.2%). Outcomes measured the patients' decision regarding whether to use LARC after being informed of out-of-pocket expenses. Results There was a dramatic increase in the proportion of patients who had LARC methods placed if expense was under $200 (p<.001). Placement rate for privately insured patients was 86.6% for those who paid less than $200 compared to 27.8% for those who paid $200 or more. Medicaid patients, for whom the device was free, had a 78.0% placement rate. For every additional $100 patients had to pay out of pocket, the odds of deciding to use the prescribed LARC method decreased. Conclusions LARC methods are utilized significantly more often when out-of-pocket cost is low. Cost appears to be a significant barrier to device placement for the group of privately insured Appalachian patients with out-of-pocket expenses over $200. Despite the improvements in coverage for many women provided under the Affordable Care Act, cost may remain a barrier for privately insured women who are required to pay some or all of the cost of LARC methods. Implications Unintended pregnancy rates in the United States remain high, especially in Appalachia. One contributing factor is reliance on user-dependent methods which have significantly high typical use failure rates. Placement of LARC methods for more patients could decrease unintended pregnancy, but device costs may be one barrier to utilization, even for those with private insurance. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

We described the following among U.S. primary care physicians: (1) perceived importance of vaccines recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices relative to U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) preventive services, (2) attitudes toward the U.S. adult immunization schedule, and (3) awareness and use of Medicare preventive service visits. Methods. We conducted an Internet and mail survey from March to June 2012 among national networks of general internists and family physicians. Results. We received responses from 352 of 445 (79%) general internists and 255 of 409 (62%) family physicians. For a 67-year-old hypothetical patient, 540/606 (89%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 87, 92) of physicians ranked seasonal influenza vaccine and 487/607 (80%, 95% CI 77, 83) ranked pneumococcal vaccine as very important, whereas 381/604 (63%, 95% CI 59, 67) ranked Tdap/Td vaccine and 288/607 (47%, 95% CI 43, 51) ranked herpes zoster vaccine as very important (p<0.001). All Grade A USPSTF recommendations were considered more important than Tdap/Td and herpes zoster vaccines. For the hypothetical patient aged 30 years, the number and percentage of physicians who reported that the Tdap/Td vaccine (377/604; 62%, 95% CI 59, 66) is very important was greater than the number and percentage who reported that the seasonal influenza vaccine (263/605; 43%, 95% CI 40, 47) is very important (p<0.001), and all Grade A and Grade B USPSTF recommendations were more often reported as very important than was any vaccine. A total of 172 of 587 physicians (29%) found aspects of the adult immunization schedule confusing. Among physicians aware of “Welcome to Medicare” and annual wellness visits, 492/514 (96%, 95% CI 94, 97) and 329/496 (66%, 95% CI 62, 70), respectively, reported having conducted fewer than 10 such visits in the previous month. Conclusions. Despite lack of prioritization of vaccines by ACIP, physicians are prioritizing some vaccines over others and ranking some vaccines below other preventive services. These attitudes and confusion about the immunization schedule may result in missed opportunities for vaccination. Medicare preventive visits are not being used widely despite offering a venue for delivery of preventive services, including vaccinations. © 2016 Association of Schools and Programs of Public Health."

Methods: Data for this study were drawn from the 2013 National Profile of Local Health Departments Study conducted by National Association of County and City Health Officials. A total of 505 LHDs completed the Module 2 questionnaire of the Profile Study, in which LHDs were asked whether they implemented strategies and evaluated strategies to target the behavioural healthcare needs of the underserved populations. To assess LHDs' level of engagement in assuring access to behavioural healthcare services, descriptive statistics were computed, whereas the factors associated with assuring access to these services were examined by using logistic regression analyses. To account for complex survey design, we used SVY routine in Stata 11. Results: Only about 24.9% of LHDs in small jurisdiction (<50,000 population) and 35.3% of LHDs in medium-size jurisdiction implemented/evaluated strategies to target the behavioural healthcare services needs of underserved populations in their jurisdiction in 2013. Logistic regression model results showed that LHDs having city/multicity jurisdiction (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) =.16, 95% confidence interval (CI):.04-.77), centralised governance (AOR =.12, 95% CI:.02-.85), and those located in South Region (AOR =.25, 95% CI:.08-.74) or the West Region (AOR =.36, 95% CI: 14-.94), were less likely to have implemented/evaluated strategies to target the behavioural healthcare needs of the underserved. Conclusions: The extent to which the LHDs implemented or evaluated strategies to target the behavioural healthcare needs of the underserved population varied by geographic regions and jurisdiction types. Different community needs or different state Medicaid programmes may have accounted for these variations.

The puzzle is why these doctrines sometimes condemn threatening lawful action to induce agreements but sometimes do not. This Article provides a general solution to this puzzle. Such threats are (and should be) deemed unlawfully coercive only when they are contrived, meaning that the threatened action would not have occurred if no threat could have been made. I show that such contrived threats can be credible because making the threat strongly influences whether the threatened action occurs. When such threats are uncontrived warnings, meaning that the threatened action would have occurred even if no threat could have been made, they are not coercive and can only benefit the agreeing parties. However, sometimes (as with blackmail) agreements produced by uncontrived warnings are also unlawful on the ground that they harm third parties. The contrived-threat test explains why the Medicaid-defunding threat in the Affordable Care Act was unconstitutional. It also explains why the recent King v Burwell conclusion-that the Affordable Care Act does not withhold tax credits from states that do not create insurance exchanges-would have been constitutionally required even if it had not been required by the statutory text."

We found that changes in health insurance coverage explained some of the variations in ED utilization; however, the magnitudes of health insurance coverage variables were very small relative to the mean of ED utilization.

We posit that legislative changes such as the Affordable Care Act created challenges for hospital systems that accelerated their adoption of these models. In this study, we analyze 117 hospital systems in six states and report on their convenient care strategies.

This Article argues that the current rate review process is limited in its ability to lower health insurance costs as it does not address the primary driver of rising premiums-the excessive prices paid by health insurers to healthcare providers. The efficacy of the Act's rate review process is further diminished by two additional factors: (1) a retrospective medical loss ratio requirement that pressures insurers to lower administrative costs prior to rate review, and (2) the limited scope of the new rate review requirements. Nevertheless, this Article does not advocate abandoning health insurance rate review. Instead, this Article contends that health insurance rate review holds great potential to control healthcare costs and hold down premium increases if it is modified from its present form, created to address century-old insurance market defects, to be a more dynamic process that gives state insurance commissioners the authority to correct market failures in the healthcare industry that drive up the prices insurers pay for the healthcare services we consume."

We describe the variability in social media presence among US children's hospitals and the distribution of their Facebook content curation. Methods: Social media data from freestanding children's hospitals were extracted from September-November 2013. Social media adoption was reviewed for each hospital-generated Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Google+ and Pinterest platform. Facebook page (number of Likes) and Twitter account (number of followers) engagement were examined by hospital characteristics. Facebook posts from each hospital over a 6-week period were thematically characterized. Results: We reviewed 5 social media platforms attributed to 45 children's hospitals and 2004 associated Facebook posts. All hospitals maintained Facebook and Twitter accounts and most used YouTube (82%), Google+ (53%) and Pinterest (69%). Larger hospitals were more often high performers for Facebook (67% versus 10%, p<0.01) and Twitter (75% versus 17%, p<0.05) engagement than small hospitals. The most common Facebook post-themes were hospital promotion 35% (706), education and information 35% (694), community partnership or benefit 24% (474), fundraising 21% (426), and narratives 12% (241). Of health education posts, 73% (509) provided pediatric health supervision and anticipatory guidance. Conclusions: Social media adoption by US children's hospitals was widespread. Implications: Beyond its traditional marketing role, social media can serve as a conduit for health education, engagement with communities, including community benefit. © 2015 Elsevier Inc."

This study explored the relationship between having assets in excess of usual Medicaid limits and health and quality of life in a sample of Medicaid Buy-In participants. Using self-reported survey data, we compared groups with US$2,000 or less in cash assets (the usual Medicaid limit) and those with more than US$2,000. Participants with higher assets had significantly better health status and quality of life. Males, younger respondents, and respondents with intellectual disabilities were most likely to have higher assets. Although many Buy-Ins allow assets greater than US$2,000, assets are still capped for most individuals. The Affordable Care Act’s Medicaid expansion does not limit assets in determining eligibility. Especially for younger individuals with disabilities, expansion coverage might allow greater asset accumulation and better health and quality of life, while avoiding lifelong dependence on disability programs. © 2014, © Hammill Institute on Disabilities 2014."

The Affordable Care Act incentivizes health systems for better meeting patient needs, but often guidance about patient preferences for particular health services is limited. All too often vulnerable patient populations are excluded from these decision-making settings. A community-based participatory approach harnesses the in-depth knowledge of those experiencing barriers to health care. Method. We made three modifications to the RAND-UCLA appropriateness method, a modified Delphi approach, involving patients, adding an advisory council group to characterize existing knowledge in this little studied area, and using effectiveness rather than “appropriateness” as the basis for rating. As a proof of concept, we tested this method by examining the broadly delivered but understudied nonmedical services that community health centers provide. Results. This method created discrete, new knowledge about these services by defining 6 categories and 112 unique services and by prioritizing among these services based on effectiveness using a 9-point scale. Consistent with the appropriateness method, we found statistical convergence of ratings among the panelists. Discussion. Challenges include time commitment and adherence to a clear definition of effectiveness of services. This diverse stakeholder engagement method efficiently addresses gaps in knowledge about the effectiveness of health care services to inform population health management. © 2015, © 2015 Society for Public Health Education."

We use a statistical methodology that allows us to study not only the behavior of the average citizen, but also the behavior of “types” of citizens with latent predispositions that incline them toward participation or abstention. The 2010 election is an excellent case study, because it was a period when citizens were still suffering the consequences of the 2008 financial crisis and many were concerned about the state’s budgetary crisis. We find that individuals who blamed one of the parties for the problems with the budget process, and who held a position on the 2010 Affordable Care Act, were often considerably more likely to participate. We also find, however, that the impact of economic evaluations, positions on the health care reform, and blame attributions was contingent on citizens’ latent participation propensities and depended on the class of political activity. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York."

Evidence shows that primary care physician (PCP) supply correlates positively with improved health, but its association with obesity in the United States as not been adequately characterized. Our purpose was to characterize the association between PCP supply in US counties and adult obesity. Methods: We performed a multivariate logistic regression analysis to examine the relationship between county-level PCP supply and individual obesity status. We controlled for individual variables, including sex, race, marital status, income, and insurance status, and county-level variables, including rurality and poverty. Results: Higher county-level PCP supply was associated with lower adult obesity after controlling for common confounders. Individuals living in counties with the most robust PCP supply were about 20% less likely to be obese (P ≤.01) than those living in counties with the lowest PCP supply. Conclusions: While the observed association between the supply of PCPs and lower rates of obesity may not be causal, the association warrants further investigation. This may have important implications for restructuring the physician workforce in the context of the current PCP shortage and implementation of the Affordable Care Act and the patient-centered medical home."

Although studies have compared the cost of cerebral aneurysm clipping (CAC) and coiling, they have not focused on identification of drivers of cost after CAC, or prediction of its magnitude. The objective of the present study was to develop and validate a predictive model of hospitalization cost after CAC. Methods We performed a retrospective study involving CAC patients who were registered in the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database from 2005 to 2010. The two cohorts of ruptured and unruptured aneurysms underwent 1:1 randomization to create derivation and validation subsamples. Regression techniques were used for the creation of a parsimonious predictive model. Results Of the 7798 patients undergoing CAC, 4505 (58%) presented with unruptured and 3293 (42%) with ruptured aneurysms. Median hospitalization cost was US 24 398 (IQR 17 079 to 38 249) and 73 694 (IQR 46 270 to 115 128) for the two cohorts, respectively. Common drivers of cost identified in the multivariate analyses included the following: length of stay, number of admission diagnoses and procedures, hospital size and region, and patient income. The models were validated in independent cohorts and demonstrated final R2 values very similar to the initial models. The predicted and observed values in the validation cohort demonstrated good correlation. Conclusions This national study identified significant drivers of hospitalization cost after CAC. The presented model can be utilized as an adjunct in the cost containment debate and the creation of data driven policies."

It redefines the relationships in health care by placing an emphasis on collaborating with patients of all ages, and their families, at all levels of care, in all health care settings, and in organizational change and improvement. This collaboration ensures that health care is responsive to an individual's priorities, preferences, and values. In patient-and family-centered care, patients define their ""family"" and determine how they and their family will participate in care and decision making. While patient-and family-centered care can improve the experience of care, safety, and quality, it also can improve the learning environment for students and trainees. The author shares personal stories to illustrate the core concepts of patient-and family-centered care, when they are present in health care interactions, and when they are not. Drawing from these stories and the author's experience in working with academic medical centers and other health care organizations over many decades, recommendations for changes in medical education are suggested that can contribute to the development of a health care workforce with the skills and commitment to partner respectfully, effectively, and authentically with patients and families.

We tested the effectiveness of a behaviorally informed policy tool - plan recommendations - in improving marketplace decisions. Study Setting: Data were gathered from a community sample of 656 lower-income, minority, rural residents of Virginia. Study Design: We conducted an incentive-compatible, computer-based experiment using a hypothetical marketplace like the one consumers face in the federally-facilitated marketplaces, and examined their decision quality. Participants were randomly assigned to a control condition or three types of plan recommendations: social normative, physician, and government. For participants randomized to a plan recommendation condition, the plan that maximized expected earnings, and minimized total expected annual health care costs, was recommended. Data Collection: Primary data were gathered using an online choice experiment and questionnaire. Principal Findings: Plan recommendations resulted in a 21 percentage point increase in the probability of choosing the earnings maximizing plan, after controlling for participant characteristics. Two conditions, government or providers recommending the lowest cost plan, resulted in plan choices that lowered annual costs compared to marketplaces where no recommendations were made. Conclusions: As millions of adults grapple with choosing plans in marketplaces and whether to switch plans during open enrollment, it is time to consider marketplace redesigns and leverage insights from the behavioral sciences to facilitate consumers' decisions. © 2016 Barnes et al.

This study was conducted to assess the prevalence of and factors associated with U.S. women's difficulty accessing prescription contraception (pill, patch, or ring). Materials and Methods: We performed a nationally representative survey of adult women at risk of unintended pregnancy (aged 18-44, not pregnant or seeking pregnancy, sexually active, not sterilized) using a probability-based web panel. In November to December 2011, 2046 women completed the survey. Weighted proportions were calculated and logistic regression was used to identify covariates associated with difficulty obtaining or refilling prescription contraception. Results: A total of 1385 (68%) women had ever tried to get a prescription for hormonal contraception. Among this population, 29% reported ever having problems obtaining a prescription or refills. In multivariable regression, uninsured (vs. privately insured) and Spanish-speaking (vs. English-speaking) women were significantly more likely to report difficulties; women with a high school degree and those with some college (vs. a college degree or higher) were significantly less likely to report difficulty. Difficulties included cost barriers or lack of insurance (14%), challenges obtaining an appointment or getting to a clinic (13%), the clinician requiring a clinic visit, exam, or Pap smear (13%), not having a regular doctor/clinic (10%), difficulty accessing a pharmacy (4%), and other reasons (4%).

The potential for these cost savings has been demonstrated in the primary care and inpatient populations, but not for patients with emergency conditions or traumatic injuries. Methods Our study evaluated adult trauma patients transferred to the tertiary care hospitals of a pioneer ACO, comparing those who were transferred from within the ACO to those from outside the ACO in terms of overall cost of hospitalization. Hospital length of stay and number of imaging studies were predetermined secondary outcomes. Results The study population included 7696 hospitalizations for traumatic injuries over a 5-year period, 85.1% of which were for patients transferred from outside the ACO. Patients transferred from within the ACO had a 7.2% lower overall cost of hospitalization (P =.032). Mean injury severity scores were not significantly different between groups. Differences in mortality, intensive care unit length of stay, and overall hospital length of stay were not significant. However, analysis of radiology studies performed during the hospitalization revealed that patients transferred from within the ACO had, on average, 0.47 fewer advanced imaging studies per hospitalization than did those transferred from outside the ACO (3.55 vs 4.02 studies per hospitalization, P =.003).

Previous studies have shown differences in outcomes based on insurance status, but associated costs to health care systems are in need of further study. The purpose of the present study was to investigate how treatment, outcomes, and health care resource utilization differ between the uninsured and commercially insured in the setting of AA. Methods Patients with AA were identified by International Classification of Diseases, ninth edition, codes using the Agency for Health Care Administration Florida Hospital inpatient discharge data sets for 2002-2011. The outcomes studied were admission with complicated versus uncomplicated appendicitis, receiving laparoscopic versus open appendectomy and experiencing a perioperative complication, length of stay, and overall hospital cost. Data were analyzed using logistic, negative binomial, and least squares multivariate regression. A P value <0.05 was considered significant. All equations controlled for patient demographics, comorbidities, and year and hospital-fixed effects. Results The uninsured were more likely to present with complicated appendicitis (odds ratio = 1.31, P < 0.01), less likely to receive laparoscopic appendectomy (odds ratio = 0.70, P < 0.01), had longer length of stay, greater costs but had similar rates of perioperative complications in comparison to the commercially insured. Conclusions Insurance status is known to affect health care utilization. The uninsured may delay seeking medical assistance, causing greater incidence of complicated disease and increased costs of treatment. Increasing the number of insured via the Affordable Care Act may improve patient outcomes and decrease costs related to AA.

Methods: Cross-sectional analysis using the 2006-2010 National Ambulatory Medical Care Surveys, annual probability samples of outpatient visits in the U.S. We estimated national prevalence of safety-net visits using weighted percentages to account for the complex survey design. We conducted bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses to examine characteristics associated with safety-net clinic use. Results: More than one-third (35.0%) of all primary care safety-net clinic visits were among adults with non-Medicaid primary insurance, representing 6,642,000 annual visits nationally. The strongest predictors of safety-net use among non-Medicaid insured adults were: being from a highpoverty neighborhood (AOR 9.53, 95%CI 4.65-19.53), being dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid (AOR 2.13, 95%CI 1.38-3.30), and being black (AOR 1.97, 95%CI 1.06-3.66) or Hispanic (AOR 2.28, 95%CI 1.32-3.93). Compared to non-safety-net users, non-Medicaid insured adults who used safety-net clinics had a higher prevalence of diabetes (23.5%vs. 15.0%, p<0.001), hypertension (49.4%vs. 36.0%, p<0.001), multimorbidity (≥2 chronic conditions; 53.5%vs. 40.9%, p<0.001) and polypharmacy (≥4 medications; 48.8% vs. 34.0%, p<0.001). Nearly one-third (28.9%) of Medicare beneficiaries in the safety-net were dual eligibles, compared to only 6.8% of Medicare beneficiaries in non-safety-net clinics (p<0.001). Conclusions: Safety net clinics are important primary care delivery sites for non-Medicaid insured minority and low-income populations with a high burden of chronic illness. The critical role of safety-net clinics in care delivery is likely to persist despite expanded insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act. © 2016 Nguyen et al.

The Affordable Care Act will create incentives for primary care centers to begin providing behavioral health (MH and SU) services, thus promising to address the MH and SU treatment gaps. This paper examines the implementation of integrated care protocols by three primary care organizations. Methods: The Behavioral Health Integration in Medical Care (BHIMC) tool was used to evaluate the integrated care capacity of primary care organizations that chose to participate in the Kern County (California) Mental Health Department's Project Care annually for 3. years. For a subsample of clinics, change over time was measured. Informed by the Conceptual Model of Evidence-Based Practice Implementation in Public Service Sectors, inner and outer contextual factors impacting implementation were identified and analyzed using multiple data sources and qualitative analytic methods. Results: The primary care organizations all offered partially integrated (PI) services throughout the study period. At baseline, organizations offered minimally integrated/partially integrated (MI/PI) services in the Program Milieu, Clinical Process - Treatment, and Staffing domains of the BHIMC, and scores on all domains were at the partially integrated (PI) level or higher in the first and second follow-ups. Integrated care services emphasized the identification and management of MH more than SU in 52.2% of evaluated domains, but did not emphasize SU more than MH in any of them. Many of the gaps between MH and SU emphases were associated with limited capacities related to SU medications. Several outer (socio-political context, funding, leadership) and inner (organizational characteristics, individual adopter characteristics, leadership, innovation-values fit) contextual factors impacted the development of integrated care capacity. Conclusions: This study of a small sample of primary care organizations showed that it is possible to improve their integrated care capacity as measured by the BHIMC, though it may be difficult or unfeasible for them to provide fully integrated behavioral health services. Integrated services emphasized MH more than SU, and enhancing primary care clinic capacities related to SU medications may help close this gap. Both inner and outer contextual factors may impact integrated service capacity development in primary care clinics. Study findings may be used to inform future research on integrated care and inform the implementation of efforts to enhance integrated care capacity in primary care clinics. © 2015 Elsevier Inc."

It was based on primary data collected from a survey conducted during March to April 2012 among a sample of self-identified African American adults in Tallahassee-Leon County area of northwest Florida. The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) Version 22 was used for running frequency analysis on the data set and multivariable regression modeling. The results showed that of 524 respondents, 382 (73%) had health insurance while 142 (27%) lacked insurance. Majority of insured respondents, 332 (87%), used preventive health services. However, the remaining 13% of respondents did not use preventive services because they were unfamiliar with the ACA provision of free access to preventive services for insured people. Regression analysis showed a high (91.04%) probability that, among the insured, the use of preventive health services depended on the person’s age, income, and education. For uninsured residents, the lack of health insurance was the key reason for non-use of preventive health services, while among the insured, lack of knowledge about the ACA benefit of free access contributed to non-use of preventive services.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of patient choice in nonoperative vs surgical management of uncomplicated acute appendicitis in children. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Prospective patient choice cohort study in patients aged 7 to 17 years with acute uncomplicated appendicitis presenting at a single pediatric tertiary acute care hospital from October 1, 2012, through March 6, 2013. Participating patients and families gave informed consent and chose between nonoperative management and urgent appendectomy. INTERVENTIONS: Urgent appendectomy or nonoperative management entailing at least 24 hours of inpatient observation while receiving intravenous antibiotics and, on demonstrating improvement of symptoms, completion of 10 days of treatment with oral antibiotics. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcomewas the 1-year success rate of nonoperative management. Successful nonoperative management was defined as not undergoing an appendectomy. Secondary outcomes included comparisons of the rates of complicated appendicitis, disability days, and health care costs between nonoperative management and surgery. RESULTS A total of 102 patients were enrolled; 65 patients/families chose appendectomy (median age, 12 years; interquartile range [IQR], 9-13 years; 45 male [69.2%]) and 37 patients/families chose nonoperative management (median age, 11 years; IQR, 10-14 years; 24 male [64.9%]). Baseline characteristics were similar between the groups. The success rate of nonoperative management was 89.2%(95%CI, 74.6%-97.0%) at 30 days (33 of 37 children) and 75.7%(95% CI, 58.9%-88.2%) at 1 year (28 of 37 children). The incidence of complicated appendicitis was 2.7%in the nonoperative group (1 of 37 children) and 12.3%in the surgery group (8 of 65 children) (P =.15). After 1 year, children managed nonoperatively compared with the surgery group had fewer disability days (median [IQR], 8 [5-18] vs 21 [15-25] days, respectively; P <.001) and lower appendicitis-related health care costs (median [IQR], $4219 [$2514-$7795] vs $5029 [$4596-$5482], respectively; P =.01). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: When chosen by the family, nonoperative management is an effective treatment strategy for children with uncomplicated acute appendicitis, incurring less morbidity and lower costs than surgery.

In recent decades, the number of religious interest groups (as well as interest groups in general) has greatly expanded, but the role that the religious organizations play as interest groups in the policy arena has received relatively little attention. How are they similar to and different from other interest groups? What tactics do they use? How successful are they? Under what conditions is success or failure more likely? This article examines Roman Catholic religious groups as interest groups in the congressional policymaking process. First, it places Catholic interest groups in the context of the interest group literature, and second, it examines Catholic interest groups’ activity in the passage of welfare reform in 1996 and in the passage of health care reform in 2010.

The aged community is a social context that is important for understanding individuals' political attitudes and behaviours. We know that social contexts often constrain the information available within the community. Also recent work indicates that this happens with the aged social context as well. Older adults living among concentrations of their peers are more politically knowledgeable than older adults without the same neighbourhood context. I hypothesise that older adults living in aged communities will be more supportive of the ACA than their peers without the same context because they know more about the ACA and its age-related benefits. To test this hypothesis, I use data from the Cooperative Congressional Election Studies for the years 2009–2012 and assess whether the aged context has had an impact on residents' attitudes towards health-care reform, the ACA, specifically. I find that older residents of aged communities are more likely to report supportive attitudes in 2010 and 2012 than older residents of communities without a significant older adult presence.

This article assesses the contemporary profile of the American bishops from this broad angle, particularly in light of new dynamics under the papacy of Francis I. It does so by documenting public Catholicism’s presence in ecclesial institutions, other public institutions, and lay-centered social movements (particularly faith-based community organizing) and via a case study of the healthcare reform debate around the State Children’s Health Insurance Program and the Affordable Care Act. Cultural and institutional factors shaping Catholic public presence are analyzed in three dimensions of social life: institutional leadership; authority dynamics within the Church; and the culture of prayer, spirituality, and worship in parishes.

The Affordable Care Act, implemented in January of 2014, aimed to reduce the number of uninsured. If the Affordable Care Act achieves this goal, surgeons may benefit from improved reimbursement rates. The authors' purpose was to evaluate the effects of the Affordable Care Act on payor distribution and surgeon reimbursements for maxillofacial trauma surgery at their institution. Methods: A review of all patients undergoing surgery for maxillofacial trauma between January of 2012 and December of 2014 was conducted. Insurance status, and amounts billed and collected by the surgeon, were recorded. Patients treated before implementation of the Affordable Care Act were compared to those treated after. Results: Five hundred twenty-three patients were analyzed. Three hundred thirty-four underwent surgery before implementation of the Affordable Care Act, and 189 patients underwent surgery after. After implementation of the Affordable Care Act, the proportion of uninsured decreased (27.2 percent to 11.1 percent; p < 0.001) and the proportion of patients on Medicaid increased (7.8 percent to 25.4 percent; p < 0.001). Overall surgeon reimbursement rate increased from 14.3 percent to 19.8 percent (p < 0.001). Conclusions: After implementation of the Affordable Care Act, we observed a significant reduction in the proportion of maxillofacial trauma patients who were uninsured. Surgeons' overall reimbursement rate increased.

One primary mechanism for meeting that goal is the establishment of new individual health insurance marketplaces where consumers can shop for, compare, and purchase plans, with subsidies if they are eligible. In this issue brief, we explore how the Affordable Care Act is influencing competition in the individual marketplaces in four states--Kansas, Nevada, Rhode Island, and Washington. Strategies include: educating consumers and providing coverage information in one place to ease decision-making; promoting competition among insurers; and ensuring a level playing field for premium rate development through the rate review process."

We found that about one third of insured expenditures would have been unaffordable, with a much higher percentage among publicly insured individuals.

The author maintains that reading theACAagainst the politics of Native American health care policy shows that, depending on their regional needs and particular contexts, many Native Americans are well-placed to benefit from recent Obama-era reforms. At the same time, the kinds of options made available by the ACA constitute a departure from the service-based (as opposed to insurance-based) Indian Health Service (IHS). Accordingly, the author argues that ACA reforms-private marketplaces, Medicaid expansion, and accommodations for Native Americans-are best read as potential ""supplements"" to an underfunded IHS. Whether or not Native Americans opt to explore options under the ACA will depend in the long run on the quality of the IHS in the post-ACA era.

The purpose of this study is to examine factors influencing intentions to not apply for health insurance via the ACA among uninsured free clinic patients in a state not expanding Medicaid. Uninsured primary care patients utilizing a free clinic (N = 551) completed a self-administered survey in May and June 2015. Difficulty obtaining information, lack of instruction to apply, and cost, are major factors influencing intention not to apply for health insurance through the ACA. US born English speakers, non-US born English speakers, and Spanish speakers reported different kinds of perceived barriers to applying for health insurance through the ACA. Age is an important factor impacting individuals’ intentions not to apply for health insurance through the ACA, as older patients in particular need assistance to obtain relevant information about the ACA and other resources. A number of unchangeable factors limit the free clinics’ ability to promote enrollment of health insurance through the ACA. Yet free clinics could be able to provide some educational programs or the information of resources to patients.

Methods: We performed an analysis from a cross-sectional study of cancer survivors aged 18–64 years using nationally representative data from the 2009 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System survey. We assessed the prevalence of current smoking among cancer survivors. Also, in a subset excluding never smokers, we assessed cessation status of cancer survivors operationalized as comparing current to former smokers. Results: The study population (N = 18,896) was predominantly 45–64 years of age, female, and white. The prevalence of current smoking was substantially greater among cancer survivors without HI (40.9 %) than for those with HI (19.5 %). Cancer survivors with no HI had 2-fold greater adjusted odds of not quitting cigarette smoking compared to those with HI. Among those with insurance, cancer survivors who did not have regular health care provider or could not see doctor due to cost or had their last routine checkup ≥1 year ago had 60–80 % fold greater adjusted odds of not quitting cigarette smoking compared to cancer survivors who had better access to health care. Conclusions: Cancer survivors without HI have substantially greater current smoking rates compared with those with HI. Among cancer survivors with HI, those who experienced health care access-related problems had lower cessation rates than their counterparts. Implications for Cancer Survivors: Smoking cessation needs to be recognized as a crucial component of preventive care for cancer survivors.

Patients face escalating costs of care and restricted choice of physician and hospital in a largely corporatized health care system. The goals of family medicine are compromised by these system trends. The ACA is unsustainable for a number of reasons, including lack of price controls and cost containment, unaffordable costs for patients and taxpayers, widespread underinsurance, and massive administrative waste. Financing reform through single-payer national health insurance will bring a fairer system of universal coverage for comprehensive care of higher quality at less cost, while enabling a renaissance of family medicine and primary care as an expanding base of our health care system. © 2016 by Society of Teachers of Family Medicine."

STUDY DESIGN: A random sample of 463 CHOICE participants who received an intrauterine device between January 2008 and June 2009 were contacted for a follow-up telephone survey (median follow-up time, 69.6 months). This sub-study compares the insurance statuses at enrollment and at follow-up using a related samples McNemar test. RESULTS: This analysis includes the 311 women who consented to participate in the follow-up survey and provided insurance status information.

We noted a statistically significant change in insurance status over this time period (41% uninsured at time of enrollment, 24% uninsured at time of follow-up; p<0.001). Multinomial analysis showed that a change to full-time employment was associated with gaining insurance (RR=1.97, 95% CI 1.12–3.47). CONCLUSION: Women in this study were more likely to gain insurance than lose insurance between enrollment in CHOICE and at the time of follow-up.

This may substantially affect women who prefer an intrauterine device (IUD), a long-acting reversible contraceptive, because of high upfront costs that they would otherwise face. However, imperfect enforcement of and exceptions to this provision could limit its effect. Study design We analyzed administrative data for 417,221 women whose physicians queried their insurance plans from January 2012 to March 2014 to determine whether each woman had insurance coverage for a hormonal IUD and the extent of that coverage. Results In January 2012, 58% of women would have incurred out-of-pocket costs for an IUD, compared to only 13% of women in March 2014. Differentials by age and region virtually dissolved over the period studied, which suggests that the ACA reduced inequality among insured women. Conclusions Our findings suggest that the cost of hormonal IUDs fell to US$0 for most insured women following the implementation of the ACA. Implications Financial barriers to one of the most effective methods of contraception fell substantially following the ACA. If more women interested in this method can access it, this may contribute to a decline in unintended pregnancies in the United States. © 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc."

The ACA will increase health coverage by expanding Medicaid eligibility to individuals living below 138% of the federal poverty level, subsidizing the purchase of private insurance among individuals not eligible for Medicaid, and requiring employers with 50 or more employees to offer health insurance. An anticipated result of this landmark legislation is improvement in the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of mental disorders in racial/ethnic minorities, particularly for Latinos, who traditionally have had less access to these services. However, these efforts alone may not sufficiently ameliorate mental health care disparities for Latinos. Faith-based organizations (FBOs) could play an integral role in the mental health care of Latinos by increasing help seeking, providing religion-based mental health services, and delivering supportive services that address common access barriers among Latinos. Thus, in determining ways to eliminate Latino mental health care disparities under the ACA, examining pathways into care through the faith-based sector offers unique opportunities to address some of the cultural barriers confronted by this population. We examine how partnerships between FBOs and primary care patient-centered health homes may help reduce the gap of unmet mental health needs among Latinos in this era of health reform. We also describe the challenges FBOs and primary care providers need to overcome to be partners in integrated care efforts."

Recent US legislation offers opportunities for private and public insurers to include IBCLC services as a covered benefit. Objective: To explore US states' Medicaid coverage of IBCLC services following January 2014 legislative expansions of coverage for preventive health services. Methods: To assess IBCLC reimbursement practices, 20 states, stratified by Medicaid expansion (yes/no) and 3-month exclusive breastfeeding rates, were selected to participate. An electronic survey was sent to Medicaid and Maternal Health Directors, breastfeeding coordinators, and Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) coordinators between July and December 2014. Email follow-ups clarified missing or ambiguous responses. Results: Of the 15 states responding, 9 had Medicaid expansion. None of the states permitted IBCLCs to bill for services autonomously. In 9 states, IBCLC services were covered with some type of stipulation, for example, billing under a physician. Of the 9 states with IBCLC coverage, 7 had accepted Medicaid expansion. States with higher rates of exclusive breastfeeding were also more likely to provide IBCLC coverage. Conclusion: Recent legislative changes to public and private insurance that could expand coverage of IBCLCs have not yielded appreciable changes, particularly in states without Medicaid expansion. There is a need for research on the effects of adopting expanded coverage for IBCLCs and advocacy to do so. © International Lactation Consultant Association."

Shared medical appointments (SMAs) are one way to improve access and increase practice productivity, but few studies have examined the patient's perspective on participation in SMAs. To understand patient experiences, 5 focus group sessions were conducted with a total of 30 people in the San Francisco Bay Area. The sessions revealed that most participants felt that they received numerous tangible and intangible benefits from SMAs, particularly enhanced engagement with other patients and physicians, learning, and motivation for health behavior change. Most importantly, participants noted changes in the power dynamic during SMA visits as they increasingly saw themselves empowered to impart information to the physician. Although SMAs improve access, engagement with physicians and other patients, and knowledge of patients' health, they also help to ease the workload for physicians. © Copyright 2016, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc."

This study examined the long-term (36-month) impact of Oregon's 2008 randomized Medicaid expansion (""Oregon Experiment"") on receipt of 12 preventive care services in community health centers using electronic health record data. Methods Demographic data from adult (aged 19-64 years) Oregon Experiment participants were probabilistically matched to electronic health record data from 49 Oregon community health centers within the OCHIN community health information network (N=10,643). Intent-to-treat analyses compared receipt of preventive services over a 36-month (2008-2011) period among those randomly assigned to apply for Medicaid versus not assigned, and instrumental variable analyses estimated the effect of actually gaining Medicaid coverage on preventive services receipt (data collected in 2012-2014; analysis performed in 2014-2015). Results Intent-to-treat analyses revealed statistically significant differences between patients randomly assigned to apply for Medicaid (versus not assigned) for 8 of 12 assessed preventive services. In intent-to-treat analyses, Medicaid coverage significantly increased the odds of receipt of most preventive services (ORs ranging from 1.04 [95% CI=1.02, 1.06] for smoking assessment to 1.27 [95% CI=1.02, 1.57] for mammography). Conclusions Rates of preventive services receipt will likely increase as community health center patients gain insurance through Affordable Care Act expansions.

More than 5 million of the newly insured are expected to have mental health and substance use disorders. In addition, state and federal efforts to integrate behavioral and medical health needs through patientcentered medical home models and innovations in payment strategies provide an unprecedented opportunity to use federal financial support to improve not only access to care, but also improve quality through active care coordination, use of interdisciplinary teams, colocating services, and engaging in warm hand-offs between providers in the same setting. These potential advances are hindered in 24 different states because of Medicaid payment policy, with 7 explicitly limiting the ability to reimburse for physical health and behavioral health services on the same day for all providers. Without the ability for providers to be reimbursed for different services on the same day to improve behavioral and medical health care coordination, these states could be limited in their ability to improve care via patient-centered approaches and interdisciplinary team-based care that would involve physicians, clinical psychologists, psychiatrists, and other mental health professionals.

Methods. We related a measure of relative state progress toward Medicaid expansion updated to 2015 to each state's economic circumstances, established policy frameworks in states, partisan control of state government, and lobbyists for businesses, medical professionals, unions, and public interest organizations. Results. The 9201 lobbyists working on health care reform in state capitols exerted a strong and significant impact on Medicaid expansion. Controlling for confounding factors (including partisanship and existing policy frameworks), we found that business and professional lobbyists exerted a negative effect on state Medicaid expansion and, unexpectedly, that public interest advocates exerted a positive effect. Conclusions. There are 3.1 million adults who lack coverage because they live in the 20 states that refused to expand Medicaid. Although political party and lobbyists for private interests present significant barriers in these states, legislative lobbying on behalf of the uninsured appears likely to be effective."

Study design A nationally recruited cross-sectional study of adolescents between ages 13 and 18 years, and parents of adolescents from different families, were recruited. The primary outcome was self-report of preventive care in the last 12 months. Demographic, family health discussions, physical/emotional health importance, and preventive care barriers were gathered from adolescents and parents. Results The majority of the sample (500 adolescents and 504 parents in different families) reported a primary care visit within 12 months (parents = 78.7%; adolescents = 66.9%). Adolescent participants identified more barriers than parents (parents = 0.69; adolescents = 1.42). Adolescent who reported having discussions with parents about health (aOR 1.57, 95% CI 1.26-1.98) and seeing a subspecialist provider (aOR 3.72, CI 1.21-11.47) were more likely to report preventive visits. Barriers for parents and adolescents include the belief that an appointment is only needed when a child is sick (parent aOR 0.21, CI 0.08-0.61; adolescent aOR 0.29, CI 0.17-0.51) and family cannot afford cost (parent aOR 0.34, CI 0.15-0.81; adolescent aOR 0.50, CI 0.26-0.97). Barriers for parents include the child sees a specialist (aOR 0.26, CI 0.08-0.88) and their child does not need a checkup (aOR 0.12, CI 0.05-0.34). Lastly, a barrier for adolescents was parents never schedule preventive visits (aOR 0.31, CI 0.17-0.58). Conclusions The Affordable Care Act has the potential to limit preventive care barriers.

Objective We investigated whether health insurance correlates with more advanced disease, receipt of treatment, and survival in melanoma. Methods This was a cross-sectional analysis of 61,650 patients with cutaneous melanoma using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. Results Under multivariate analysis, patients with either Medicaid insurance (hazard ratio, 1.83; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.65-2.04; P <.001) or uninsured status (hazard ratio, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.44-1.85; P <.001) were more likely to die of any cause, including melanoma. Uninsured compared with non-Medicaid insured cases more often presented with increasing tumor thickness (odds ratio [OR], 2.19; 95% CI, 1.76-2.73; P <.001) and presence of ulceration (OR, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.40-1.92; P <.001), and less often received treatment (OR, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.60-2.19; P <.001).

We present the results of 36 in-depth interviews with state and national leaders in the single-payer movement and consider how the human rights framework has entered into their strategic organizing, and how they interpret Vermont's experiences.

This database was used to evaluate woman's health-related ED use by patients registered in this OB/GYN clinic compared with patients not affiliated with the clinic. Results Over an 23-month period, there were 41,791 ED visits made by 21,223 individual women > 12 years of age. A total of 7251 (17.4%) of the ED visits were for OB/GYN-related conditions.

As applied to behavioral health, health homes or medical homes have become increasingly adult-focused models, with a primary goal of coordinating physical and behavioral health care. For children and youth with serious emotional disorders, health homes must go beyond physical and behavioral health care to connect with other child-focused sectors, such as education, child welfare, and juvenile justice. Each of these systems have a significant role in helping children meet health and developmental goals, and should be included in integrated approaches to care for children and youth. Health homes for young people should incorporate a continuum of care from health promotion to the prevention and treatment of disorders. The challenge for child- and youth-focused health homes is to integrate effective services and supports into the settings where young people naturally exist, drawing on the best evidence from mental health, physical medicine, and other fields.

We analyzed secondary data on health insurance information-seeking behaviors collected from a survey of 343 uninsured individuals. The Internet, mail, and television were among the most frequently used media, though all 3 had low trust scores. Participants sought information from health care providers and interpersonal sources less frequently but trusted it more than they trusted the media.

We examined the rate of complications resulting in 30-day readmission following endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery. Study Design Case series with chart review. Setting Academic tertiary care center. Methods A database of 466 consecutive patients who underwent endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery at a tertiary care center between April 2006 and July 2014 was reviewed for 30-day causes for readmission, length of stay, level of care required, and average cost. Results Twenty-nine readmissions were identified within our study period, indicating a 30-day readmission rate of 6.2%. Among all patients, rates of 30-day readmission were 2.1% for epistaxis, 1.5% for hyponatremia, 0.9% for cerebrospinal fluid leak, and 1.7% for other medical conditions. Average cost per readmission ranged from $6011 for hyponatremia to $24,613 for cerebrospinal fluid leak. Conclusion Overall, the rate of 30-day readmission following endoscopic pituitary surgery is low. However, common causes of readmission do add significant cost to the overall care of this patient population. Special attention to surgical technique to prevent epistaxis and cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea, as well as multidisciplinary team management to avoid postoperative endocrine dysfunction, is critical to minimize these complications. © 2015 American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation."

Methods In 2010 (preintervention), 66 stroke patients aged more than 75 years were admitted to an IR facility, on average, 8.8 days postacute care. In 2012 (postintervention), 58 patients aged more than 75 years were admitted to the same IR facility, on average, 5.0 days postacute care. SDMM intervention involved weekly adjustments of clinical care focused on potential barriers to discharge home. Functional Independence Measure (FIM) efficiency, length of stay (LOS), and disposition rates to community or home, acute care, and long-term care were compared pre- and postintervention within facility, and facility data were compared to national case-mix-group-adjusted data from the Uniform Data System for Medical Rehabilitation for both years (2010/2012). Results Pre- and postintervention demographics and prestroke living support/setting were similar, but preintervention had on average 4 more days LOS in IR and 3.8 more days to IR onset. There were significantly more discharges to community in postintervention (79.3%) compared to preintervention (56.9%) (chi-square = 6.02, P <.013). The preintervention group did not significantly differ from 2010 national data whereas the postintervention/2012 group significantly differed from 2012 national data for higher FIM efficiency (t = -3.1, P <.002) and more discharges to community (chi-square = 19.7; P <.0001). From 2010 to 2012, there were 3.8 times more discharges to community (chi-square = 8535; P <.0001) and 6 times fewer acute-care dispositions postintervention than nationally (chi-square = 58.7; P <.0001). © 2015 National Stroke Association."

Pediatric rehabilitation therapy services and mobility aids have an important role in the health of children with special health care needs, and the Affordable Care Act (ACA) may increase coverage for these needs. Identifying the prevalence of and factors associated with therapy and mobility aid needs and unmet needs prior to the full implementation of the ACA will be useful for future evaluation of its impact. Objective. The purpose of this study was to identify the prevalence of and factors associated with caregiver perceived needs and unmet needs for therapy or mobility aids among children with special health care needs living in the United States. Design. A cross-sectional, descriptive, multivariate analysis was conducted. Methods. The 2009-2010 National Survey of Children With Special Health Care Needs was used to identify a nationally representative sample of children with special health care needs with needs for therapy (weighted n=2,603,605) or mobility aids (weighted n=437,971). Odds of having unmet needs associated with child and family characteristics were estimated. Results. Nearly 1 in 5 children with therapy needs had unmet needs, and nearly 1 in 10 children with mobility aid needs had unmet needs. Unmet needs were most strongly associated with how frequently the condition affected function and being uninsured in the previous year. Limitations. Data were caregiver reported and not verified by clinical assessment. Survey data grouped physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy; analysis was not discipline specific. Conclusions. This evidence serves as a baseline about the future impact of the ACA. Pediatric rehabilitation professionals should be aware that children with special health care needs whose condition more frequently affects function and who have insurance discontinuity may need more support to meet therapy or mobility aid needs. © 2016 American Physical Therapy Association."

These medications are expensive, and cost-sharing requirements for patients can be a barrier to their use. For Medicare beneficiaries, the Affordable Care Act will close the Part D coverage gap (doughnut hole), which will reduce cost sharing from 100% in 2010 to 25% in 2020 for drug spending above $2,960 until the beneficiary reaches $4,700 in out-of-pocket spending. How much these changes will reduce out-of-pocket costs is unclear. Methods: We used the Medicare July 2014 Prescription Drug Plan Formulary, Pharmacy Network, and Pricing Information Files from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services for 1,114 stand-alone and 2,230 Medicare Advantage prescription drug formularies, which represent all formularies in 2014. We identified orally administered anticancer medications and summarized drug costs, cost-sharing designs used by available plans, and the estimated out-of-pocket costs for beneficiaries without low-income subsidies who take a single drug before and after the doughnut hole closes. Results: Little variation existed in formulary design across plans and products. The average price per month for included products was $10,060 (range, $5,123 to $16,093). In 2010, median beneficiary annual out-of-pocket costs for a typical treatment duration ranged from $6,456 (interquartile range, $6,433 to $6,482) for dabrafenib to $12,160 (interquartile range, $12,102 to $12,262) for sunitinib. With the assumption that prices remain stable, after the doughnut hole closes, beneficiaries will spend approximately $2,550 less. Conclusion: Out-of-pocket costs for Medicare beneficiaries taking orally administered anticancer medications are high and will remain so after the doughnut hole closes.

Design: Retrospective chart review. Setting: Academic center serving urban and suburban patients between April 2009 and October 2011. Participants: Nine hundred eighty-three health maintenance visits for asymptomatic, insured female adolescents aged 15-19 years. Interventions: None. Main Outcome Measures: Dichotomous dependent variables of interest indicated whether chlamydia screening was: (1) offered; and (2) accepted. The key independent variable insurance type was coded as 'public' if Medicaid or Medicaid Managed Care and 'private' if a commercial plan. χ2 and logistic regression analyses were used to assess the significance of differences in screening rates according to insurance type. Results: Of asymptomatic health-maintenance visits 933 (95%) had a documented sexual history and 339 (34%) had a documented history of sexual activity. After excluding those who had a documented chlamydia screen in the 12 months before the visit (n = 79; 23%), 260 visits met eligibility for chlamydia screening. Only 169 (65%) of eligible visits had chlamydia screening offered and there was no difference in offer of screening according to insurance type. Significantly more visits covered by public insurance had chlamydia screening accepted (98%) than those covered by private insurance (82%). Controlling for demographic factors, the odds of accepted chlamydia screening was 8 times higher in visits covered by public insurance than those with private insurance. Conclusion: Although publically and privately insured teens were equally likely to be offered chlamydia screening, publically insured teens were significantly more likely to accept screening. Future research should investigate reasons for this difference in screening acceptance. These findings have implications for interventions to improve chlamydia screening because more adolescents are covered by parental insurance under the Affordable Care Act. © 2016 North American Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology."

The goal of TCM is to assist clients in navigating the health care system to increase care engagement and treatment adherence for individuals with complex needs. HIV-positive individuals engaged in care are more likely to be virally suppressed, improving clinical outcomes and decreasing chances of HIV transmission. The purpose of this study was to understand the impact of TCM management on outcomes for people with HIV. Data were obtained from Amida Care, which operates not-for-profit managed care Medicaid and Medicare Special Needs Plans (SNPs) for HIV clients. Changes in clinical, cost, as well as medical and pharmacy utilization data among TCM clients were examined between January 2011 through September 2012 from the start of case management enrollment through the end of the study period (i.e., up to 6 months after disenrollment). Additionally, CD4 counts were compared between Amida Care TCM clients and non-TCM clients. Notable findings include increased CD4 counts for TCM clients over the one-year study period, achieving parity with non-TCM clients (i.e., Mean CD4 count > 500). When looking exclusively at TCM clients, there were increases in medication costs over time, which were concomitant with increased care engagement. Current findings demonstrate that TCM is able to achieve its goals of improving care engagement and treatment adherence. Subsequent policy changes resulting from the Affordable Care Act and the New York State Medicaid Redesign have made the Health Home the administrator of TCM services. Government entities charged with securing and managing TCM and care coordination for people with HIV should provide thoughtful and reasonable guidance and oversight in order to maintain optimal clinical outcomes for TCM clients and reduce the transmission of HIV. © 2016 Brennan-Ing et al.

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act encourages healthcare systems to track quality-of-care measures; little is known about their impact on mortality rates. The objective of this study was to assess associations between HIV quality of care and mortality rates. Methods. A longitudinal survival analysis of the Veterans Aging Cohort Study included 3038 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients enrolled between June 2002 and July 2008. The independent variable was receipt of ≥80% of 9 HIV quality indicators (QIs) abstracted from medical records in the 12 months after enrollment. Overall mortality rates through 2014 were assessed from the Veterans Health Administration, Medicare, and Social Security National Death Index records. We assessed associations between receiving ≥80% of HIV QIs and mortality rates using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and adjusted Cox proportional hazards models. Results were stratified by unhealthy alcohol and illicit drug use. Results. The majority of participants were male (97.5%) and black (66.8%), with a mean (standard deviation) age of 49.0 (8.8) years. Overall, 25.9% reported past-year unhealthy alcohol use and 28.4% reported past-year illicit drug use. During 24 805 person-years of follow-up (mean [standard deviation], 8.2 [3.3] years), those who received ≥80% of QIs experienced lower age-adjusted mortality rates (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.75; 95% confidence interval,. 65-.86). Adjustment for disease severity attenuated the association. Conclusions. Receipt of ≥80% of select HIV QIs is associated with improved survival in a sample of predominantly male, black, HIV-infected patients but was insufficient to overcome adjustment for disease severity. Interventions to ensure high-quality care and address underlying chronic illness may improve survival in HIV-infected patients. © 2015 The Author 2015.

To fill the gap in understanding these therapists' attitudes toward effective change and implementation of EBTs is the goal of the study. MFT attitudes toward adopting EBTs and their readiness for change in their treatment practices are examined. Participants were 137 Licensed MFTs providing mental health services in California. t tests, correlation analyses, and multiple regressions illustrated that gender, education, previous study of EBTs, and utilization of previous training were associated with more positive attitudes toward adoption of EBT.

With the Affordable Care Act, the Obama administration addressed the issue with a complex system of mandates, subsidies, and state marketplaces. The implementation of the reform encountered many obstacles including legal challenges, a congressional shut down, system failure, and, recently, a growing number of state legislatures (23 to date) enacting measures to nullify or opt out of the reform. This paper examines the resistance to the Act in two interrelated dimensions: legal challenges and state legislative opposition. These two dimensions of resistance are explored in order to speculate on the legal and political sustainability of the reform. Ultimately, the discussion on the sustainability of health care reform sheds considerable light on the broader sustainability of federal intervention in social policies (gun control, abortion, immigration, death penalty, drug control). © Common Ground, Ilaria Di Gioia, All Rights Reserved."

However, the evaluation strategies of quality by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services do not consider geography when comparisons are made among plans. Using an overall measure of a plan's quality in the public sector-the Medicare Advantage (MA) star ratings- we explored the impact of geography in these ratings.We identified 2,872 U.S counties in 2010. The geographic factor predicted a larger fraction of the MA ratings' compared to sociodemographic factors which explained less. Also, after the risk adjustments, almost half of the U.S. states changed their ranked position in the star ratings. Further, lower MA star ratings were identified in the Southeastern region. These findings suggest that the geographic component effect on the ratings is not trivial and should be considered in future adjustments of the metric, which may enhance the transparency, accountability, and importantly level the playing field more effectively when comparing quality across health plans. © 2016 Soria-Saucedo et al.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited."

We investigate predictive modeling of future health care costs using several statistical techniques. Our analysis was performed based on a dataset of 30,000 insureds containing claims information from two contiguous years. The dataset contains more than 100 covariates for each insured, including detailed breakdown of past costs and causes encoded via coexisting condition flags. We discuss statistical models for the relationship between next-year costs and medical and cost information to predict the mean and quantiles of future cost, ranking risks and identifying most predictive covariates. A comparison of multiple models is presented, including (in addition to the traditional linear regression model underlying risk adjusters) Lasso GLM, multivariate adaptive regression splines, random forests, decision trees, and boosted trees.

Objectives: Determine the ACA's impact on colorectal cancer screening among HDHP members. Research Design: Pre-post with comparison group, constructed before and after the ACA. Subjects: We studied 2003-2012 administrative claims data of a large national health insurer. HDHP members had 1 year of lowdeductible (r$500) plan enrollment followed by 1 year of HDHP (Z$1000) enrollment after an employer-mandated switch; HDHP enrollment occurred fully after the ACA for 21,605 members and fully before the ACA for 106,609 members. We propensity scorematched contemporaneous low-deductible (r$500) control group members to both the before-ACA and after-ACA HDHP groups. We examined the 1-year impact of the HDHP switch separately in the before-ACA and after-ACA study cohorts, then compared these changes to estimate ACA effects.

Results: Before the ACA, colorectal cancer screening tests declined by 37/10,000 (-71, -4) among HDHP members versus controls; after the ACA, HDHP members experienced a nonsignificant increase in screening [+52/10,000 (-19,124)]. Corresponding changes in colonoscopy were -55/10,000 (-81, -29) before and +20/10,000 (-38, 78) after the ACA. Thus, the ACA was associated with increased colorectal cancer screening rates [+89/10,000 (11, 168); relative: +9.1% (0.5-17.8)] and screening colonoscopies [+75/10,000 (12-139); relative: +16.4% (2.5-30.3)] among HDHP members. Conclusion: The ACA was associated with improved colorectal cancer screening among HDHP members. © 2013 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc."

The Affordable Care Act requires most health plans to cover the federal Recommended Uniform Screening Panel of newborn screening (NBS) tests with no cost sharing. However, state NBS programs vary widely in both the number of mandated tests and their funding mechanisms, including a combination of state laboratory fees, third-party billing, and other federal and state funding. We assessed the potential impact of the Affordable Care Act coverage mandate on states’ NBS funding. Method. We performed an extensive review of the refereed literature, federal and state agency reports, relevant organizations’ websites, and applicable state laws and regulations; interviewed 28 state and federal officials from August to December 2014; and then assessed the interview findings manually. Results. Although a majority of states had well-established systems for including laboratory-based NBS tests in bundled charges for newborn care, billing practices for critical congenital heart disease and newborn hearing tests were less uniform. Most commonly, birthing facilities either prepaid the costs of laboratory-based tests when acquiring the filter paper kits, or the facilities paid for the tests when the kits were submitted. Some states had separate arrangements for billing Medicaid, and smaller facilities sometimes contracted with hearing test vendors that billed families separately. Conclusion. Although the Affordable Care Act coverage mandate may offset some state NBS funding for the screenings themselves, federal support is still required to assure access to the full range of NBS program services. Limiting reimbursement to the costs of screening tests alone would undermine the common practice of using screening charges to fund follow-up services counseling, and medical food or formula, particularly for low-income families. © 2016 Association of Schools and Programs of Public Health."

Objective: Assess knowledge of the ACA among academic dermatologists. Design: A 21-item survey was administered to members of the Association of Professors of Dermatology (APD). The items assessed knowledge and opinions of the ACA, and demographics of the participants. Multivariate regressions were conducted to determine associations between variables. Participants: Members of the Association of Professors of Dermatology. Main Measure: Knowledge of the ACA. Results: One hundred and eight out of 368 APD members completed the survey (29.3%). Ninetysix percent of responders practice in an academic setting. Only 36 (33.3%) rated their knowledge of the ACA as good/great, whereas 67 (62%) believed that the ACA will change their practice. The mean number of knowledge questions correctly answered was 4.5 out of 7 (64.3%). Dermatologists who reported that their knowledge of the bill was good/great (p=0.04) and procedural dermatologists (p= 0.04) answered more questions correctly. Compared to procedural dermatologists, general dermatologists were more likely to support the ACA (p=0.003) but less likely to answer questions correctly. Conclusion: There appears to be knowledge gaps among dermatologists about the ACA and discordance between support for and knowledge about the ACA. The need for educating dermatologists on health care policies may warrant further investigation. © 2016 by the article author(s)."

Because the ACA’s employer health insurance mandate applies to individuals who work 30 or more hours per week, employers may try to avoid the mandate by cutting workers’ hours below the 30-hour threshold in order to avoid having to provide them with health insurance. Although the employer mandate only went into effect in 2015, many observers have argued that forward-looking employers began to shift towards a part-time workforce well in advance of the mandate. To test this hypothesis, we examine relative shifts across two categories of part-time workers (25–29 hours and 31–35 hours). We find some evidence of a shift from the 31–35-hour category into the 25–29-hour category after the passage of ACA in March 2010. However, that shift is not more pronounced among low-wage workers or among workers in industries and occupations most likely to be affected by the mandate. Thus, there is little evidence that the ACA has caused the shift across hours categories, or led to an increase in part-time employment. However, the ACA could cause a shift towards part-time work in the future as the mandate takes effect. © 2015 Taylor & Francis."

In order to better understand the impact of the type of health insurance and health outcomes, there is a need to examine health disparities and inequalities between the insured and the uninsured based on their eligibility for coverage. Methods: The current study used the data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey 2012 (MEPS). Selected health characteristics and access to care items were compared in regard to the insurance status: private, public, the uninsured, but likely eligible for Medicaid expansion (EME), and the uninsured, but likely required to purchase health plans through the health insurance exchanges (RPIE). Results: Analyses showed that 17.2 % of US adults ages 27-64 were eligible as EME and 12.9 % as RPIE in 2012. Compared to the insured groups, the uninsured who were eligible for coverage reported fewer health problems than those insured privately and publicly. However, they also reported less use of health care, including preventive health service, screenings, and unmet health care needs. Conclusions: The ACA aims to increase coverage options and access to treatment and preventive health care services for the majority of the uninsured US population. However, it may not play as significant of a role in improving health among the uninsured, in particular, those eligible for the Medicaid expansion. © 2016 Hong et al."

Research Design: Using the 2011-2014 National Health Interview Survey, we examine changes in health care access and utilization for the nonelderly US adult population. Multivariate linear probability models are estimated to adjust for demographic and sociodemographic factors. Results: The implementation of the ACA (year indicator 2014) is associated with significant reductions in the probabilities of being uninsured (coef =-0.03, P < 0.001), delaying any necessary care (coef =-0.03, P < 0.001), forgoing any necessary care (coef =-0.02, P < 0.001), and a significant increase in the probability of having any physician visits (coef = 0.02, P < 0.001), compared with the reference year 2011. Interaction terms between the 2014 year indicator and race/ethnicity demonstrate that uninsured rates decreased more substantially among non-Latino African Americans (African Americans) (coef =-0.04, P < 0.001) and Latinos (coef =-0.03, P < 0.001) compared with non-Latino whites (whites). Latinos were less likely than whites to delay (coef =-0.02, P < 0.001) or forgo (coef =-0.02, P < 0.001) any necessary care and were more likely to have physician visits (coef = 0.03, P < 0.005) in 2014. The association between year indicator of 2014 and the probability of having any emergency department visits is not significant. Conclusions: Health care access and insurance coverage are major factors that contributed to racial and ethnic disparities before the ACA implementation.

One way states have addressed this implementation challenge is through the development of consumer assistance programs. In these programs, health care professionals—known as “Assistors”—are trained in insurance enrollment services to help consumers navigate the complex application and plan selection process, with the ultimate goal of optimizing enrollment rates. Organizational context Cicatelli Associates Inc. (CAI), a non-profit capacity building organization, has served as the Statewide Training Center for New York's Health Insurance Program Initiative since 2013, before the ACA Marketplace roll-out occurred. This article presents a narrative of CAI's experiences and promising practices related to training and developing of the Assistor workforce in New York State (NYS). Solutions identified through training and development By the end of the second enrollment period (February 2015), NYS trained and certified over 11,000 Assistors 1; CAI trained fifteen percent of this total workforce. As a result of this intensive workforce training effort, NYS observed extremely high rates of facilitated enrollment, and overall success with the roll-out process. Lessons from the field Through this initiative, CAI has garnered key insights for other organizations that engage in similar work, as well as state policymakers considering how to integrate and bolster the Assistor programs in their states. These lessons include: the necessity of ensuring that Assistors are armed with all technical concepts and messages; ensuring that Assistors are motivated to work through a change process; the constructive feedback process that can occur when these Assistors directly communicate issues to the state; and the transformation of public opinion that can occur when Assistors provide good customer service and can effectively promote statewide and federal ACA policies and benefits. © 2016 Elsevier Inc."

Both liberal and conservative economists have denounced these subsidies as ""regressive"" and lauded a provision of the Affordable Care Act-the Cadillac Tax-that would curtail them. The claim that the subsidies are regressive rests on estimates showing that the affluent receive the largest subsidies in absolute dollars. But this claim ignores the standard definition of regressivity, which is based on the share of income paid by the wealthy versus the poor, rather than on dollar amounts. In this study, we calculate the value of tax subsidies in 2009 as a share of income for each income quintile and for the wealthiest Americans. In absolute dollars, tax subsidies were highest for families between the 80th and 95th percentiles of family income and lowest for the poorest 20%. However, as shares of income, subsidies were largest for the middle and fourth income quintiles and smallest for the wealthiest 0.5% of Americans. We conclude that the tax subsidy to employment-based insurance is neither markedly regressive, nor progressive.

Empirical evidence links hearing loss to a variety of other medical conditions, including depression, falls, and cognitive problems. Additionally, there is a demonstrated relationship between hearing loss and dementia. And yet, most insurance programs do not cover the cost of hearing aids. Even Medicare, the federal insurance program for those aged sixty-five and over, statutorily excludes coverage of hearing aids, which cost between $2,000 and $7,000 a pair.

This Article elaborates on one specific provision of the ACA that could be utilized to authorize insurance coverage under the Medicare program. It also addresses other provisions in the ACA, including required preventive screenings and selected ""Essential Health Benefits,"" that, absent the Medicare exclusion, arguably would provide for such coverage.

The relationship between consumer cost sharing and consistent use of the pill is not well understood, and the impact of the elimination of cost sharing for oral contraceptive pills in a mandate in the Affordable Care Act (ACA) is not yet known. We analyzed insurance claims for 635,075 women with employer-sponsored insurance who were initiating use of the pill, to examine rates of discontinuation and nonadherence, their relationship with cost sharing, and trends before and during the first year after implementation of the ACA mandate. We found that cost sharing for oral contraceptives decreased markedly following implementation, more significantly for generic than for brand-name versions. Higher copays were associated with greater discontinuation of and nonadherence to generic pills than was the case with zero copayments. Discontinuation of the use of generic or brand-name pills decreased slightly but significantly following ACA implementation, as did nonadherence to brand-name pills. Our findings suggest a modest early impact of the ACA on improving consistent use of oral contraceptives among women initiating their use. © 2016 Project HOPE-The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc."

These restrictions provided incentives for the hospitals and their owners to take preemptive actions before the effective dates of ACA provisions and modify their operations thereafter.We studied 106 physician-owned hospitals in Texas to determine how they responded to ACA restrictions. We found that there were significant pre-ACA increases in the formation, physician ownership, and physical capacity of physician-owned hospitals, which suggests that they reacted quickly to the policy changes. After the ACA's provisions took effect, the hospitals improved the use of their assets to generate increased amounts of services, revenue, and profits. We found no evidence that existing physician-owned hospitals stopped accepting Medicare to avoid the ACA restrictions, although some investors adopted a seemingly unsuccessful strategy of not accepting Medicare at physicianowned hospitals formed after implementation of the ACA. We conclude that the ACA restrictions effectively eliminated the formation of new physician-owned hospitals, thus accomplishing what previous legislative efforts had failed to do. © 2016 Project HOPE-The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc."

We examined the impact of this change on women's patterns of choosing prescription contraceptive methods. Using claims data for a sample of midwestern women ages 18-46 with employer-sponsored coverage, we examined the contraceptive choices made by women in employer groups whose coverage complied with the mandate, compared to the choices of women in groups whose coverage did not comply. We found that the reduction in cost sharing was associated with a 2.3-percentage-point increase in the choice of any prescription contraceptive, relative to the 30 percent rate of choosing prescription contraceptives before the change in cost sharing. A disproportionate share of this increase came from increased selection of long-term contraception methods. Thus, the removal of cost as a barrier seems to be an important factor in contraceptive choice, and our findings about long-term methods may have implications for rates of unintended pregnancy that require further study. © 2016 Project HOPE-The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc."

We hypothesize that women with access to reasonable break time and private space to express breast milk would be more likely to breastfeed exclusively at 6 months and to continue breastfeeding for a longer duration. Methods: Data are from Listening to Mothers III, a national survey of women ages 18 to 45 who gave birth in 2011 and 2012. The study population included women who were employed full or part time at the time of survey. Using two-way tabulation, logistic regression, and survival analysis, we characterized women with access to breastfeeding accommodations and assessed the associations between these accommodations and breastfeeding outcomes. Results: Only 40% of women had access to both break time and private space. Women with both adequate break time and private space were 2.3 times (95% CI, 1.03-4.95) as likely to be breastfeeding exclusively at 6 months and 1.5 times (95% CI, 1.08-2.06) as likely to continue breastfeeding exclusively with each passing month compared with women without access to these accommodations. Conclusions: Employed women face unique barriers to breastfeeding and have lower rates of breastfeeding initiation and shorter durations, despite compelling evidence of associated health benefits. Expanded access to workplace accommodations for breastfeeding will likely entail collaborative efforts between public health agencies, employers, insurers, and clinicians to ensure effective workplace policies and improved breastfeeding outcomes. © 2016 Jacobs Institute of Women's Health."

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA) had the goals of expanding health care insurance coverage and slowing growth in health care expenditures. OBJECTIVES: To (a) describe the proportion of senior citizens who had prescription drug insurance coverage and the proportion who experienced financial hardship from purchasing medications in 2015, and (b) compare the findings with those collected in 1998 and 2001. METHODS: Data were obtained in 1998 and 2001 via surveys mailed to national random samples of seniors. Of 2,434 deliverable surveys, 946 (39[%]) were returned, and 700 (29[%]) provided usable data. Data were collected in 2015 via an online survey sent to a national sample of adults. Of 26,173 usable responses, 3,933 were aged 65 years or older. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression analyses described relationships among study variables. RESULTS: Results showed that the proportion of seniors without prescription coverage was 9[%] in 2015, a decrease from 29[%] in 2001 and 32[%] in 1998. The proportion of senior citizens reporting financial hardship from medication purchases was 36[%] in 2015, a rise from 31[%] in 2001 and 19[%] in 1998. For those without prescription drug coverage, 34[%], 55[%], and 49[%] reported financial hardship in 1998, 2001, and 2015, respectively. For those with drug coverage, 12[%], 22[%], and 35[%] reported financial hardship in 1998, 2001, and 2015, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: After implementation of Medicare Part D and the ACA, the proportion of seniors without prescription drug coverage decreased. However, self-reported financial hardship from purchasing medications increased. Senior citizens with prescription drug insurance may be experiencing financial hardship from increasing out-of-pocket costs for insurance premiums, cost sharing, and full-cost obligation for some medications. © 2016, Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy.

RQ1: do the benefits of a co-management arrangement outweigh the costs? RQ2: does physician alignment aid in the effective implementation of the ACA directives set for hospitals? Design/methodology/approach: A case study of a 350-bed non-profit community hospital co-management company. The quantitative data are eight quarters of quality metrics prior and eight quarters post establishment of the co-management company. The quality metrics are all based on standardized national requirements from the Joint Commission and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services guidelines. These measures directly impact the quality initiatives under the ACA that are applicable to all healthcare facilities. Qualitative data include survey results from hospital employees of the perceived effectiveness of the co-management company. A paired samples difference of means t-test was conducted to compare the timeframe before co-management and post co-management. Findings: The findings indicate that the benefits of a co-management arrangement do outweigh the costs for both the physicians and the hospital (RQ1). The physicians benefit through actual dollar payout, but also with improved communication and greater input in running the service line. The hospital benefits from reduced cost – or reduced penalties under the ACA – as well as better communication and greater physician involvement in administration of the service line. RQ2: does physician alignment aid in the effective implementation of the ACA directives set for hospitals? The hospital improved in every quality metric under the co-management company. A paired sample difference of means t-test showed a statistically significant improvement in five of the six quality metrics in the study. Originality/value: Previous research indicates the potential effectiveness of co-management companies in improving healthcare delivery and hospital-physician relations (Sowers et al., 2013). The current research takes this a step further to show that the data do in fact support these concepts. The hospital and the physicians carrying out the day-to-day actions have shared goals, better communication, and improved quality metrics under the co-management company. As the number of co-management companies increases across the USA, more research can be directed at determining their overall impact on quality care. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

Data Source/Study Setting: Primary data collected between 2007 and 2009 from Veterans Affairs physicians and their primary care panels. Study Design: Nested study within a cluster randomized controlled trial of three types of financial incentives and no incentives (control). We compared the proportion of physicians' black patients meeting hypertension performance measures for baseline and final performance periods. We measured risk selection by comparing the proportion of patients who switched providers, patient visit frequency, and panel turnover. Due to limited power, we prespecified in the analysis plan combining the three incentive groups and oversampling black patients. Data Collection/Extraction Method: Data collected electronically and by chart review. Principal Findings: The proportion of black patients who achieved blood pressure control or received an appropriate response to uncontrolled blood pressure in the final period was 6.3 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 0.8-11.7 percent) greater for physicians who received an incentive than for controls. There was no difference between intervention and controls in the proportion of patients who switched providers, visit frequency, or panel turnover. Conclusions and Relevance: A pay-for-performance intervention improved blood pressure control or appropriate response to uncontrolled blood pressure in black patients and did not produce risk selection. © Health Research and Educational Trust."

It is unknown, however, whether declines in out-of-pocket costs for preventive services are large enough to prompt increases in utilization, the ultimate goal of the policy. Methods: In this study, we use a nationally representative sample of ambulatory care visits to estimate the impact of the zero costsharing mandate on out-of-pocket expenditures on well-child and screening mammography visits. Estimates are made using 2-part interrupted time-series models, with well-woman visits serving as the control group because they were not covered under the zero cost-sharing mandate until after our study period. Results: Results indicate a substantial reduction in out-of-pocket costs attributable to the Affordable Care Act. Between January 2011 and September 2012, the zero cost-sharing mandate reduced pervisit out-of-pocket costs for well-child visits from $18.46 to $8.08 (56%) and out-of-pocket costs for screening mammography visits from $25.43 to $6.50 (74%). No reduction was apparent for wellwoman visits. Conclusions: The Affordable Care Act's zero cost-sharing mandate for preventive care has had a large impact on out-of-pocket expenditures for well-child and mammography visits.

Medicaid expansions may provide increased access to care for cancer survivors, a growing population with chronic conditions. We compare access to health care services among cancer survivors living in non-expansion states to those living in expansion states, prior to Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act. Methods: We use the 2012 and 2013 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System to estimate multiple logistic regression models to compare inability to see a doctor because of cost, having a personal doctor, and receiving an annual checkup in the past year between cancer survivors who lived in non-expansion states and survivors who lived in expansion states. Results: Cancer survivors in non-expansion states had statistically significantly lower odds of having a personal doctor (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 0.76, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0.63–0.92, p < 0.05) and higher odds of being unable to see a doctor because of cost (AOR 1.14, 95 % CI 0.98–1.31, p < 0.10). Statistically significant differences were not found for annual checkups. Conclusions: Prior to the passage of the Affordable Care Act, cancer survivors living in expansion states had better access to care than survivors living in non-expansion states.

This article provides the first data about the effectiveness of state Medicaid programs in promoting smoking cessation. Our analysis of Medicaid enrollees' use of cessation medications found that about 10 percent of current smokers received cessation medications in 2013. Every state Medicaid program covers cessation benefits, but the use of these medications varies widely, with the rate in Minnesota being thirty times higher than that in Texas. Most states could increase their efforts to help smokers quit, working with public health agencies, managed care plans, and others. In 2013 Medicaid spent $103 million on cessation medications-less than 0.25 percent of the estimated cost to Medicaid of smoking-related diseases. Additionally, states that have not expanded Medicaid eligibility in the wake of the Affordable Care Act have higher smoking prevalence and lower utilization rates of cessation medication, compared to expansion states. Given these factors, nonexpansion states will have a greater public health burden related to smoking. Medicaid and public health agencies should work together to make smoking cessation a priority for Medicaid beneficiaries."

This article defines and analyzes the role of government in physician reimbursement both internationally and in the United States. ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK: We create a typology for government involvement in physician reimbursement that divides intervention into either direct control or indirect control. Within those broad categories, we describe more specific forms of involvement including rate setting, operating as a public payer, employing physicians directly, providing a source of market discipline, regulating private insurance, and convening private participants in the market. FINDINGS: We apply our framework to the modern healthcare systems of Germany, Sweden, Canada, and the United States, highlighting some of the implications of differences between the systems. Our central finding is that in contrast to other example healthcare systems, the United States system features a complex interplay of federal and state government influence, both direct and indirect, into physician reimbursement. CONCLUSION: We conclude the article by examining the ways in which recent legislation including the Affordable Care Act and the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act would likely change the role of government in physician reimbursement in the United States.

The expansion raised Medicaid eligibility levels as a means to make coverage more accessible and make health care more affordable for a population likely to face financial barriers in using medical care. This article examines the first-year impact of Kentucky's Medicaid expansion on insurance coverage and access to care. Focusing on Kentucky's lowincome population, we observed large reductions in the low-income uninsurance rate from 35 percent at the end of 2013 to just below 11 percent by the end of 2014. Other findings revealed declines in unmet medical needs because of cost and declines in the number of people without a readily identifiable source of regular care among low-income groups.

Despite vigorous debate over the use of private insurance versus traditional Medicaid to provide coverage to low-income adults, there is little evidence on the relative merits of the two approaches. We compared the first-year impacts of traditional Medicaid expansion in Kentucky, the private option in Arkansas, and nonexpansion in Texas by conducting a telephone survey of two distinct waves of low-income adults (5,665 altogether) in those three states in November-December 2013 and twelve months later. Using a difference-in-differences analysis, we found that the uninsurance rate declined by 14 percentage points in the two expansion states, compared to the nonexpansion state. In the expansion states, again compared to the nonexpansion state, skipping medications because of cost and trouble paying medical bills declined significantly, and the share of individuals with chronic conditions who obtained regular care increased. Other than coverage type and trouble paying medical bills (which decreased more in Kentucky than in Arkansas), there were no significant differences between Kentucky's traditional Medicaid expansion and Arkansas's private option, which suggests that both approaches improved access among low-income adults."

Economic theory suggests that receipt of Medicaid might benefit workers who would no longer be tied to specific jobs to receive health insurance (known as job lock), giving them more flexibility in their choice of employment, or might encourage low-income workers to reduce their hours or stop working if they no longer need employment-based insurance. Evidence on labor changes after previous Medicaid expansions is mixed. To view the impact of the ACA on current labor market participation, we analyzed labor-market participation among adults with incomes below 138 percent of the federal poverty level, comparing Medicaid expansion and nonexpansion states and Medicaideligible and -ineligible groups, for the pre-ACA period (2005-13) and the first fifteen months of the expansion (January 2014-March 2015). Medicaid expansion did not result in significant changes in employment, job switching, or full- versus part-time status. While we cannot exclude the possibility of small changes in these outcomes, our findings rule out the large change found in one influential pre-ACA study; furthermore, they suggest that the Medicaid expansion has had limited impact on labor-market outcomes thus far."

Limited data exist to inform policy decisions about the most appropriate role for RWHAP under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA). Methods.We assessed associations between RWHAP assistance and antiretroviral therapy (ART) prescription and viral suppression. We used data from the Medical Monitoring Project, a surveillance system assessing characteristics of HIV-infected adults receiving medical care in the United States. Interview and medical record data were collected in 2009-2013 from 18 095 patients. Results.Nearly 41% of patients had RWHAP assistance; 15% relied solely on RWHAP assistance for HIV care. Overall, 91% were prescribed ART, and 75% were virally suppressed. Uninsured patients receiving RWHAP assistance were significantly more likely to be prescribed ART (52% vs 94%; P <. 01) and virally suppressed (39% vs 77%; P <. 01) than uninsured patients without RWHAP assistance. Patients with private insurance and Medicaid were 6% and 7% less likely, respectively, to be prescribed ART than those with RWHAP only (P <. 01). Those with private insurance and Medicaid were 5% and 12% less likely, respectively, to be virally suppressed (P ≤. 02) than those with RWHAP only. Patients whose private or Medicaid coverage was supplemented by RWHAP were more likely to be prescribed ART and virally suppressed than those without RWHAP supplementation (P ≤. 01).

To understand how this policy change may potentially impact patients with kidney cancer we examined the relationship between insurance status and cancer related outcomes. Methods: Using SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results) data we identified 18,632 patients 26 to 64 years old with kidney cancer from 2007 to 2009. For each patient we classified insurance status as no insurance, Medicaid or private insurance. After adjusting for patient and county characteristics we measured the association of insurance status with cancer stage, treatment and 1-year mortality using multinomial logistic regression with clustering or generalized estimating equations as appropriate. Results: In our study cohort 937 (5.0%) and 2,027 patients (10.9%) had no insurance and Medicaid, respectively. These patients were more likely to be younger, nonwhite, unmarried and residing in areas with lower income, education or employment (p <0.001). On adjusted analyses uninsured and Medicaid patients more often presented with advanced disease (21.3% vs 19.6% vs 11.0%) but less frequently received treatment (86.2% vs 87.9% vs 93.4%, each p <0.001) compared with privately insured patients. These adults also died of kidney cancer more often (13.6% vs 12.5% vs 6.4%, p <0.001) likely due to differences in stage and receipt of cancer directed therapy. Conclusions: Uninsured and Medicaid patients suffer disproportionately from kidney cancer with equal magnitude. Given the reliance on Medicaid, even as insurance coverage expands differences in outcomes will likely persist, underscoring the need for additional efforts that address disparities in kidney cancer care. © 2016 American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.."

Fast-turnaround household surveys fill some of the void in data on recent changes to insurance coverage, but they lack the historical data that allow analysts to account for trends that predate the ACA, economic fluctuations, and earlier public program expansions when predicting how many people would be uninsured without comprehensive health care reform. Using data from the Current Population Survey (CPS) from 2000 to 2012 and the Health Reform Monitoring Survey (HRMS) data for 2013 and 2015, this article develops an approach to estimate the number of people who would be uninsured in the absence of the ACA and isolates the change in coverage as of March 2015 that can be attributed to the ACA. We produce counterfactual forecasts of the number of uninsured absent the ACA for 9 age-income groups and compare these estimates with 2015 estimates based on HRMS relative coverage changes applied to CPS-based population estimates. As of March 2015, we find the ACA has reduced the number of uninsured adults by 18.1 million compared with the number who would have been uninsured at that time had the law not been implemented. That decline represents a 46% reduction in the number of nonelderly adults without insurance. The approach developed here can be applied to other federal data and timely surveys to provide a range of estimates of the overall effects of reform. © The Author(s) 2016."

The 2006 Tax Relief and Health Care Act established the Physician Quality Reporting System (PQRS), to enable eligible professionals to report health care quality and health outcome information that cannot be obtained from standard Medicare claims. However, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) of 2010 required the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to incorporate a combination of cost and quality into the payment systems for health care as a precursor to value-based payments. The final change to PQRS pending initiation after 2018, is based on the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA) which has incorporated alternative payment models and merit-based payment systems. Recent publication of quality performance scores by CMS has been less than optimal. When voluntary participation began in July 2007, providers were paid a bonus for reporting quality measures from 2008 through 2014, ranging from 0.5% to 2% of the Medicare Part B allowed charges furnished during the reporting period. Starting in 2015, penalties started for nonparticipation. Eligible professionals and group practices that failed to satisfactorily report data on quality measures during 2014 are subject to a 2% reduction in Medicare fee-for-service amounts for services furnished by the eligible professional or group practice during 2016. The CMS proposed rule for 2016 physician payments contained a number of provisions with proposed updates to the PQRS and Physician Value-Based Payment Modifier among other changes. The proposed rule is the first release since MACRA repealed the sustainable growth rate formula. CMS proposed to continue many existing policies regarding PQRS from 2015 to 2016. In addition, 2016 will be the year that is utilized to determine the 2018 PQRS payment adjustment. However, after 2018 the PQRS payment adjustment will be transitioned to the Merit-Based Incentive Payment System (MIPS), as required by MACRA. Overall, there will be over 280 measures in the 2016 PQRS. Readers might be surprised to find out that despite the cost intensity including time requirements personnel, the negative payment adjustments, are only the tip of the iceberg of cost. Indeed, all of the above may only be one-third or one-fourth of the cost to completely implement the PQRS system. Thus far, data across all specialties shows participation to be around 50%. In addition, penalties for lack of reporting of PQRS measures stands to be controversial to the Supreme Court ruling that unfunded mandates must not be permitted and also lack of significant relationships with improvement in quality in the overall analysis in multiple publications. © 2016, American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians.

OBJECTIVE To compare health care access, quality, and cost outcomes by insurance type (Medicaid, CHIP, private, and uninsured) for children in households with low to moderate incomes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A repeated cross-sectional analysiswas conducted using data from the 2003, 2007, and 2011-2012 US National Surveys of Children's Health, comprising 80 655 children 17 years or younger, weighted to 67 million children nationally, with household incomes between 100% and 300% of the federal poverty level. Multivariable logistic regression models compared caregiver-reported outcomes across insurance types. Analysis was conducted between July 14, 2014, and May 6, 2015. EXPOSURES Insurance type was ascertained using a caregiver-reported measure of insurance status and each household's poverty status (percentage of the federal poverty level). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Caregiver-reported outcomes related to access to primary and specialty care, unmet needs, out-of-pocket costs, care coordination, and satisfaction with care. RESULTS Among the 80 655 children, 51 123 (57.3%) had private insurance, 11 853 (13.6%) had Medicaid, 9554 (18.4%) had CHIP, and 8125 (10.8%) were uninsured. In a multivariable logistic regression model (with results reported as adjusted probabilities [95%CIs]), children insured by Medicaid and CHIP were significantly more likely to receive a preventive medical (Medicaid, 88%[86%-89%]; P < .01; CHIP, 88%[87%-89%]; P < .01) and dental (Medicaid, 80% [78%-81%]; P < .01; CHIP, 77%[76%-79%]; P < .01) visits than were privately insured children (medical, 83%[82%-84%]; dental, 73%[72%-74%]). Children with all insurance types experienced challenges in access to specialty care, with caregivers of children insured by CHIP reporting the highest rates of difficulty accessing specialty care (28%[24%-32%]), problems obtaining a referral (23%[18%-29%]), and frustration obtaining health care services (26%[23%-28%]). These challenges were also magnified for privately insured children with special health care needs, whose caregivers reported significantly greater problems accessing specialty care (29% [26%-33%]) and frustration obtaining health care services (36%[32%-41%]) than did caregivers of children insured by Medicaid, and a lower likelihood of insurance always meeting the child's needs (63%[60%-67%]) than children insured by Medicaid or CHIP. Caregivers of privately insured children were also significantly more likely to experience out-of-pocket costs (77% [75%-78%]) than were caregivers of children insured by Medicaid (26%[23%-28%]; P < .01) or CHIP (38%[35%-40%]; P < .01). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This examination of caregiver experiences across insurance types revealed important differences that can help guide future policymaking regarding coverage for families with low to moderate incomes."

A matter of debate is whether the patient’s perception of time spent with the physician improves patient satisfaction. We sought to determine whether patient-physican time correlates with patient satisfaction and which factors are associated with patient perception of time. Methods: A total of 73 patients who presented for an initial evaluation of knee osteoarthritis were evaluated by the same orthopedic surgeon at an outpatient clinic in New Orleans, LA. Each encounter was timed with a stopwatch. After the physician encounter, patients were asked to fill out a questionnaire assessing their perception of time spent with the physician, subjective pain, satisfaction with the visit, and understanding of the diagnosis and treatment plan. Patients were also asked to complete 4 functionality surveys. Radiographs of the patients’ knees were taken and quantified using Kellgren-Lawrence and Ahlbäck grading scales. Results: We noted no relationship between patient satisfaction and patients’ perception of time spent with the physician. Patients perceived their time with the physician to be an average of 6.5 minutes more than the actual time. However, patients who reported higher subjective pain scores (>7 on a 10-point scale) misestimated their time with the physician by nearly 96%, while patients with lower subjective pain scores (<7 on a 10-point scale) misestimated their time with the physician by only 54% (P<0.007). We discovered similar findings in patients with worse Kellgren-Lawrence radiographic scores as well as worse Oxford Knee Scores and Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Scores. The actual time spent was not different among patients. Conclusion: Patients with greater subjective pain and worse functional status and patients with worse radiographic severity of knee osteoarthritis perceived greater time spent with the physician. However, no relationship between these variables and patient satisfaction scores was seen. © Academic Division of Ochsner Clinic Foundation."

Findings - Both adjusted and unadjusted rates of COPD admission showed a slight decline from 2010 to 2013. The growth curve modeling showed the annual rates of change were gradually accentuated through time. GEE revealed that a moderate amount of variance (marginal R2 = 0.66) in the risk-adjusted hospital admission rates for COPD and asthma was accounted for by contextual, ecological, and organizational variables. Research limitations/implications - The contextual, ecological, and organizational factors are those associated with RHCs, not hospitals. We cannot infer how the variability in hospital practices in RHC service areas may have contributed to the disparities in admissions. Identification of RHCs with substantially higher rates than an average rate can portray the need for further enhancement of needed ambulatory or primary care services for the specific groups of RHCs. Because the risk-adjusted rates of hospitalization do not vary by classification of rural area, future research should address the variation in a specific COPD and asthma condition of RHC patients. Originality/value - Risk-adjusted admission rates for COPD and asthma are influenced by the synergism of multiple contextual, ecological, and organizational factors instead of a single factor. © 2016 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

The authors discuss how the methodology provided consensus on system CQI quality measure priorities and describe variation among the 3 service delivery models used within the state. Design: Q-sort methodology was used by home visiting (HV) service delivery providers (home visitors) to prioritize HV quality measures for the overall state HV system as well as their service delivery model. Results: There was general consensus overall and among the service delivery models on CQI quality measure priorities, although some variation was observed. Measures associated with Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting benchmark 1, Improved Maternal and Newborn Health, and benchmark 3, Improvement in School Readiness and Achievement, were the highest ranked. Conclusions: The Q-sort exercise allowed home visitors an opportunity to examine priorities within their service delivery model as well as for the overall First Teacher HV system. Participants engaged in meaningful discussions regarding how and why they selected specific quality measures and developed a greater awareness and understanding of a systems approach to HV within the state. The Q-sort methodology presented in this article can easily be replicated by other states to identify CQI priorities at the local and state levels and can be used effectively in states that use a single HV service delivery model or those that implement multiple evidence-based models for HV service delivery. © 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Background: Lack of insurance and non-white race are associated with increased severity, increased amputation rates, and decreased revascularization rates in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD). Little is known about how expanded insurance coverage affects disparities in presentation with and management of PAD. The 2006 Massachusetts health reform expanded coverage to98% ofresidentsand providedthe frameworkfor the AffordableCareAct. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of nonelderly, white and non-white patients admitted with PAD in Massachusetts (MA) and 4 control states. Risk-adjusted difference-in-differences models were used to evaluate changes in probability of presenting with severe disease. Multivariable linear regression models were used to evaluate disparities in disease severity before and after the 2006 health insurance expansion. Results: Before the 2006 MA insurance expansion, non-white patients in both MA and control states had a 12 to 13 percentage-point higher probability of presenting with severe disease (P < 0.001) than white patients. After the expansion, measured disparities in disease severity by patient race were no longer statistically significant in Massachusetts (+3.0 percentage-point difference, P = 0.385) whereas disparities persisted in control states (+10.0 percentage-point difference, P < 0.001). Overall, non-white patients in MA had an 11.2 percentage-point decreased probability of severe PAD (P = 0.042) relative to concurrent trends in control states. Conclusions: The 2006 Massachusetts insurance expansion was associated with a decreased probability of patients presenting with severe PAD and resolution of measured racial disparities in severe PAD in MA. © 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

BACKGROUND: Nurses play a key role in the patient experience and patient safety. A strong safety culture may produce positive spillover effects throughout the nurse care giving experience, resulting in patient perception of a high-quality experience. METHODS: Multivariate mixed-effects regression models were specified using data from a multistate sample of hospital units that administered both the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) staff safety culture survey and the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) patient satisfaction survey over a 12-month period. Survey response variables are measured at the unit (service line) and hospital level. RESULTS: Key variables in the HCAHPS and AHRQ surveys were significantly correlated. Findings highlight the relationship between 3 safety culture domains: Teamwork, adequate staffing, and organizational learning on the achievement of a positive patient experience.

The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database was utilized for this study. Materials and Methods Between 2007 and 2011, 5986 testicular cancer patients were included in the SEER database. Patients were classified into nonseminoma and seminoma groups. We compared mortality rates, metastasis (M+) at diagnosis, and rates of adjuvant treatments between the uninsured (UI) and insured (I) populations. Results Overall, 2.64% of UI vs 1.36% of I died from testicular cancer (P =.025) and 16.73% of UI vs 10.52% of I had M+ at diagnosis (P <.0001). In the nonseminoma group, 4.19% of UI vs 2.79% of I died from testicular cancer (P =.326) and 25.92% of UI vs 18.46% of I had M+ at diagnosis (P =.0007). Also 17.28% of UI vs 20.88% of I had retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND; P =.1).

Also 34.75% of UI vs 48.4% of I received adjuvant radiation (P =.0083). The lack of health insurance predicted poor survival after adjusting for tumor stage, receiving adjuvant radiation or RPLND. Conclusion UI testicular cancer patients present with more advanced cancer stages and have higher mortality rates than I patients. UI seminoma patients received less adjuvant radiation. This may be related to lack of access to care or more advanced cancer stage at diagnosis."

We use claims data from the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services and data from 60 interviews at three high-performing and three low-performing ACOs. Study Design: Explanatory sequential design, using qualitative data to account for patterns observed in quantitative assessment of ACO performance. Data Collection Methods: A total of 16 ACOs were first rank-ordered on measures of cost and quality of care; we then selected three high and three low performers for site visits; interview data were content-analyzed. Principal Findings: Results identify several factors that distinguish high- from low-performing ACOs: (1) collaboration with hospitals; (2) effective physician group practice prior to ACO engagement; (3) trusted, long-standing physician leaders focused on improving performance; (4) sophisticated use of information systems; (5) effective feedback to physicians; and (6) embedded care coordinators.

However, little is known about how this burden changed as a result of the ACA's enactment. We examine how the Affordable Care Act (ACA)'s coverage expansions affected uncompensated care costs at a large, diverse sample of hospitals. We estimate that in states that expanded Medicaid under the ACA, uncompensated care costs decreased from 4.1 percentage points to 3.1 percentage points of operating costs. The reductions in Medicaid expansion states were larger at hospitals that had higher pre-ACA uncompensated care burdens and in markets where we predicted larger gains in coverage through expanded eligibility for Medicaid. Our estimates suggest that uncompensated care costs would have decreased from 5.7 percentage points to 4.0 percentage points of operating costs in nonexpansion states if they had expanded Medicaid. Thus, while the ACA decreased the variation in uncompensated care costs across hospitals within Medicaid expansion states, the difference between expansion and nonexpansion states increased substantially.

Adults with comorbid diabetes and substance use disorders (SUDs) tend to use costly inpatient treatments; however, there is a lack of empirical data on implementing behavioral healthcare to reduce health risk in adults with high-risk diabetes. Given the complexity of high-risk patients' medical problems and the cost of conducting randomized trials, a feasibility project is warranted to guide practical study designs.

Methods: Data were from 10,276 respondents aged 45 years or older in 21 states reporting SMCs on the 2011 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). Odds ratios (ORs) adjusted for demographic and health-related measures were computed for discussing SMCs with a health care professional. Results: Among all respondents aged 45 or older reporting SMCs, 22.9% reported discussing them with a health care professional; among those reporting a recent routine check-up, this rate was 25.2%. The largest adjusted OR for discussing SMCs with a health care professional was for respondents reporting that SMCs always (vs never) caused them to give up household chores (OR, 3.02) or always (vs never) interfered with work (OR, 2.98). Increasing age reduced the likelihood of discussing SMCs. Among respondents who discussed SMCs, 41.8% received treatment.

We also compared 2015 churning rates in these states to survey data from 2013, before the coverage expansions. Nearly 25 percent of respondents in 2015 changed coverage during the previous twelve months-a rate lower than some previous predictions. We did not find significantly different churning rates in the three states over time. Common causes of churning were job-related changes and loss of eligibility for Medicaid or Marketplace subsidies. Churning was associated with disruptions in physician care and medication adherence, increased emergency department use, and worsening self-reported quality of care and health status. Even churning without gaps in coverage had negative effects. Churning remains a challenge for many Americans, and policies are needed to reduce its frequency and mitigate its negative impacts."

We use triple difference estimation to identify the HRRP's effects in Virginia hospitals; this method estimates the difference in changes in readmission over time between patients targeted by the policy and a comparison group of patients and then compares those difference-in-differences estimates in patients treated at hospitals with readmission rates above the national average (i.e., those at risk for penalties) and patients treated at hospitals with readmission rates below or equal to the national average (those not at risk). We find that the HRRP significantly reduced readmission for Medicare patients treated for acute myocardial infarction (AMI).

More than six million people live in such families and as a result are ineligible for premium tax credits. These families face premiums that can amount to 15.8 percent of income, or 12.0 percent after the tax advantages of employer-sponsored health coverage are factored in. We modeled the potential impact of changing the affordability test to take into account the cost of family coverage. Doing so would reduce spending on premiums from 12.0 percent to 6.3 percent of income, significantly alleviating financial burdens, but would generate little additional coverage.

These standards to become a qualified health plan (QHP) include maintaining a provider network sufficient to assure access to services. However, the complexity of emergency physician (EP) employment practices - in which the EPs frequently serve as independent contractors of emergency departments, independently establish insurance contracts, etc - and regulations governing insurance repayment may hinder the application of network adequacy standards to emergency medicine. As such, we hypothesized the existence of QHPs without in-network access to EPs. The objective is to identify whether there are QHPs without in-network access to EPs using information available through the federal Marketplace and publicly available provider directories. Results: In a national sample of Marketplace plans, we found that one in five provider networks lacks identifiable in-network EPs. QHPs lacking EPs spanned nearly half (44%) of the 34 states using the federal Marketplace. Conclusion: Our data suggest that the present regulatory framework governing network adequacy is not generalizable to emergency care, representing a missed opportunity to protect patient access to in-network physicians. These findings and the current regulations governing insurance payment to EPs dis-incentivize the creation of adequate physician networks, incentivize the practice of balance billing, and shift the cost burden to patients. © 2016 Dorner et al."

Essentially, a typical concierge medical practice limits its number of patients and provides highly personalized attention that includes comprehensive annual physicals, same-day appointments, preventive and wellness care, and fast, 24/7 response time. Concierge medicine has become popular among both physicians and patients/consumers who are frustrated by the limitations imposed by managed care organizations. From many physicians' perspectives, concierge medicine offers greater autonomy, the opportunity to return to a more manageable patient load, and the chance to improve their incomes that have declined because of increasingly lowered reimbursements for their services. From many patients'/consumers' perspectives, concierge medicine provides more immediate, convenient, and caring access to their primary care physicians and, regardless of their physician's annual retainer fee, the elimination of third-party insurance coverage costs and hassles. The major criticisms of the concierge medicine model come from some health care policy makers and experts, who believe that concierge medicine is elitist and its widespread implementation will increase the shortage of primary care physicians, which is already projected to become worse because of the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate, which requires everyone to have health insurance.Utilizing these topics as its framework, this article explains why concierge medicine's form of medical management is gaining ground, cites its advantages and disadvantages for stakeholders, and examines some of the issues that will affect its growth.

To investigate this issue, we used prescription transaction data for a panel of 6.7 million prescription drug users to compare changes in coverage, prescription fills, plan spending, and out-of-pocket spending before and after the implementation of the ACA's coverage expansion. We found a 30 percent reduction in the proportion of this population that was uninsured in 2014 compared to 2013.

Findings – It’s estimated that two out of three Americans are now overweight – and that’s bad for business. Having a fit and healthy workforce not only benefits the individual, it also means less time off sick, lower costs and better organizational performance. Firms that encourage a “wellness culture” are showing that they care about their employees – and can expect a payoff in terms of morale, motivation and productivity. What’s harder to predict is whether wellness can be made compulsory – and if compulsory, whether it still delivers a “win-win” result. Practical implications – The study indicates aspects that may require particular care when introducing an IWP to ensure that employees appreciate the health benefits of this approach rather than joining the program for purely economic reasons.

The Affordable Care Act provides $2 billion in subsidies to jump-start health insurers owned by their policyholders in an attempt to bring these costs under control. Firms with this corporate ownership structure have succeeded in other insurance markets, where Nationwide, Northwestern Mutual, and State Farm are just a few prominent examples. However, the potential of policyholder ownership in health insurance, which is dominated by investor and nonprofit ownership, is poorly understood. This Article applies theories of corporate ownership and control to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of investor, nonprofit, and policyholder health insurer ownership. Theory and an original empirical study of 1,000 individuals' projected healthcare consumption choices reveal policyholder ownership's ability to solve contracting failures, reduce overconsumption of medical services, and contribute to ""bending the cost curve"" of American health expenditures in ways unattainable by investorowned or nonprofit insurers. The ACA's provisions for subsidizing policyholder ownership, however, force these firms to adopt restrictive policies that both exacerbate potential governance costs and keep them from maximizing policyholder ownership's advantages. In fact, the ACA's requirements force these firms into nonprofit/policyholder-owned hybrid organizations that capture the advantages of neither. Using additional empirical findings, this Article recommends ways that policyholder-owned health insurers could be promoted consistent with sound corporate governance principles."

The dollar amount of the premium credit varies from individual to individual, based on a formula specified in statute. Individuals who are eligible for the premium credit, however, generally are still required to contribute some amount toward the purchase of health insurance. The premium credit may be applied only toward the cost of purchasing private health plans through health insurance exchanges. Exchanges are not insurance companies; rather, exchanges serve as marketplaces for the purchase of health insurance. They operate in every state and the District of Columbia (DC). The premium credit is refundable, so individuals may claim the full credit amount when filing their taxes, even if they have little or no federal income tax liability. The credit also is advanceable, so individuals may choose to receive the credit on a monthly basis to coincide with the payment of insurance premiums. Individuals who receive premium credits also may be eligible for subsidies that reduce cost-sharing expenses. The ACA established two types of cost-sharing subsidies. One type of subsidy reduces annual costsharing limits; the other directly reduces cost-sharing requirements (e.g., lowers a deductible).

Multiple studies have demonstrated that readmission rates are highly imprecise proxies for quality of care because readmission rates contain large amounts of statistical noise and are dependent on disease type, insurance type, severity, population, and a multitude of other factors. The current study was conducted to investigate characteristics associated with readmission and the quality of neurosurgical care. Methods Admissions data were gleaned from the University Health System Consortium database for neurosurgical patient (both cranial and spine) readmissions to assess patient-related factors relating to readmission from January 2011 to December 2014. Results Among 257,212 admissions for neurosurgical disease analyzed, patients with Medicaid and private payers as a primary insurance source had increased rates of readmission (odds ratio for readmission of 1.38 and 1.17, respectively) compared with patients with Medicare or other primary insurers. Patients with greater severity of disease and emergent or urgent admission also had statistically significant rates of readmission. Conclusions The findings suggest that readmission is affected by patient factors that are beyond the control of treating physicians. These findings also suggest that readmission rates may not be a good proxy for measurement of quality of care in neurosurgical patients. © 2016 Elsevier Inc."

Low-income tax credits for Marketplace coverage were based on premiums for non-tobacco users, which means that these credits did not offset any surcharge costs. Thus, this policy greatly increased out-of-pocket premiums for many tobacco users. Using data for 2011-14 from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, we examined the effect of tobacco surcharges on insurance status and smoking cessation in the first year of the exchanges' implementation, among adults most likely to purchase insurance from them. Relative to smokers who faced no surcharges, smokers facing medium or high surcharges had significantly reduced coverage (reductions of 4.3 percentage points and 11.6 percentage points, respectively), but no significant differences in smoking cessation. In contrast, those facing low surcharges showed significantly less smoking cessation. Taken together, these findings suggest that tobacco surcharges conflicted with a major goal of the ACA-increased financial protection-without increasing smoking cessation.

The interventions, which focused on the uptake of the human papillomavirus vaccine and community-level dietary change, had mixed results. The design and implementation of multilevel interventions are facilitated by input from the community, and more advanced methods and measures are needed to evaluate the impact of the various levels and components of such interventions. © 2016 Project HOPE-The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc."

These models support the integration of health care systems, but maximizing health and well-being for all individuals will require a broader conceptualization of health and more explicit connections between diverse partners. Integration of health services and systems constitutes the fourth Action Area in the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's Culture of Health Action Framework, which is the subject of this article. This Action Area conceives of a strengthened health care system as one in which medical care, public health, and social services interact to produce a more effective, equitable, higher-value whole that maximizes the production of health and well-being for all individuals. Three critical drivers help define and advance this Action Area and identify gaps and needs that must be addressed to move forward. These drivers are access, balance and integration, and consumer experience and quality.

A number of barriers in both the pediatric and adult healthcare systems prevent youth and their families from accessing and receiving appropriate care. With the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) in the United States, there is new emphasis on the role of the consumer as an active participant and decision-maker in the delivery of healthcare. In turn, there is a need for pediatric and adult healthcare providers to develop competence in person-centered principles and approaches within culturally and linguistically diverse contexts in an effort to facilitate individualized transition services that support the expressed goals, needs, and desires of the youth and young adults they serve. Person-centered planning philosophies can help secure a relevant and meaningful youth to adult life and healthcare transition through increased participatory and self-advocacy actions. By adopting person-centered values and strategies into the six core elements of health care transition practices, providers can begin to eliminate barriers to transition and shift the control of power into the hands of the youth and young adults who receive care. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016."

Current free-exercise doctrine and practice inadequately address organized campaigns of free-exercise litigation seemingly motivated by political ideology rather than sincere religious belief. This Article examines the political, ideological, and religious forces that have culminated into the political and legal opposition to the ACA's contraceptivecoverage regulations, identifying anomalies in the resulting legal challenges from for-profit corporations and non-profit organizations along the way. After describing the harms caused by politicized free-exercise lawsuits turning on insincere claims of religious burden, the Article offers initial proposals to both courts and governmental litigants to combat the transformation of free-exercise lawsuits into weapons of political warfare. In particular, courts and governmental litigants should adopt a more flexible approach that acknowledges the practical realities of modern religious-liberty cases, involves more frequent and sustained challenges to plaintiffs' sincerity when appropriate, and gives the government leeway to reach compromises with religious objectors without undermining the government's ability to defend other cases. On the other hand, failure to police insincere free-exercise claims will continue to cause mainstream support for genuine freeexercise claims and religious accommodations to dwindle."

This Article argues that the standard is much too strict. The current rationale ignores that courts can “rewrite,” i.e., misinterpret, a statute both by recognizing an error and by failing to do so. Accordingly, because the current doctrine is designed to protect against one type of mistake (false positives) but not the other (false negatives), it systematically underrecognizes errors and results in systematic misinterpretation of the law. Using the example of King v. Burwell, this Article shows that the overly strict scrivener’s error doctrine threatens dramatic real-world harm. In King, opponents of the Affordable Care Act exploited a likely, but less than absolutely clear, scrivener’s error to nearly bring down the most significant health reform legislation of the past half century. More still, the challenge only failed because six Justices were willing to accept an implausible textual argument. Furthermore, King is far from sui generis.

Various studies have established that networks are generally narrow. To learn more about network adequacy and access to care, we investigated two questions. First, no matter the nominal size of a network, can patients gain access to primary care services from providers of their choice in a timely manner? Second, how does access compare to plans sold outside insurance Marketplaces? We conducted a ""secret shopper"" survey of 743 primary care providers from five of California's nineteen insurance Marketplace pricing regions in the summer of 2015. Our findings indicate that obtaining access to primary care providers was generally equally challenging both inside and outside insurance Marketplaces. In less than 30 percent of cases were consumers able to schedule an appointment with an initially selected physician provider. Information about provider networks was often inaccurate.

Overall, Medicare Part D enrollees have increased drug utilization and decreased OOP costs, but coverage gaps limit the program's impact. Beneficiaries whose insurance becomes more generous after enrollment had disproportionately increased drug utilization and decreased OOP costs. Outcomes among dual-eligibles were mixed. Conclusions: There is strong evidence on how Medicare Part D and the donut hole coverage gap affect utilization and OOP costs, but weak evidence on how effects vary among dual-eligibles or across diseases.

Some states utilized this option-either tightening income limits for the same family over time or loosening them.

The model reveals some inter-temporally perverse incentives created by linking eligibility thresholds to Medicaid duration. Then, we empirically test these predictions using the Survey of Income and Program Participation and a unique compilation of state-by-family size Medicaid thresholds for both new and continuing recipients. We find that patterns of Medicaid participation and spell duration are consistent with the predictions of our model. There is also evidence that the individuals predicted by our model to lower their work hours may supply fewer hours of labor.

Although government expansion of health insurance to older workers leads to direct labor supply reductions for recipients, there may be spillover effects on the labor supply of uncovered spouses. While the most basic model predicts a decrease in overall household work hours, financial incentives such as credit constraints, target income levels, and the need for own health insurance suggest that spousal labor supply might increase. In contrast, complementarities of spousal leisure would predict a decrease in labor supply for both spouses. Utilizing a mid-1990s expansion of health insurance for U.S. veterans, we provide evidence on the effects of public insurance availability on the labor supply of spouses. Using data from the Current Population Survey and Health and Retirement Study, we employ a difference-in-differences strategy to compare the labor market behavior of the wives of older male veterans and non-veterans before and after the VA health benefits expansion. Although husbands' labor supply decreases, wives' labor supply increases, suggesting that financial incentives dominate complementarities of spousal leisure.

Electoral pressure was the most significant factor for both governors. I demonstrate that even Walker succumbed to state electoral pressures and expanded Medicaid, albeit in a manner unique to Wisconsin. He did this despite his emphatic national rhetoric rejecting Obamacare and expansion. Additionally, existing state political institutions drove each governor to decide in a manner unique to his state: previous Medicaid decisions in Wisconsin and direct democracy in Ohio provided additional pressures and divergent starting points.

Objectives: To describe the level of interoperability of LHD information systems and identify factors associated with lack of interoperability. Data and Methods: This mixed-methods research uses data from the 2015 Informatics Capacity and Needs Assessment Survey, with a target population of all LHDs in the United States. A representative sample of 650 LHDs was drawn using a stratified random sampling design. A total of 324 completed responses were received (50% response rate). Qualitative data were used from a key informant interview study of LHD informatics staff from across the United States. Qualitative data were independently coded by 2 researchers and analyzed thematically. Survey data were cleaned, bivariate comparisons were conducted, and a multivariable logistic regression was run to characterize factors associated with interoperability. Results: For 30% of LHDs, no systems were interoperable, and 38% of LHD respondents indicated some of the systems were interoperable. Significant determinants of interoperability included LHDs having leadership support (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 3.54), control of information technology budget allocation (AOR = 2.48), control of data systems (AOR = 2.31), having a strategic plan for information systems (AOR = 1.92), and existence of business process analysis and redesign (AOR = 1.49). Conclusion: Interoperability of all systems may be an informatics goal, but only a small proportion of LHDs reported having interoperable systems, pointing to a substantial need among LHDs nationwide. © Copyright 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Telehealth offers an opportunity to facilitate delivery of evidence-based smoking cessation services as well as incentive-based interventions to low-income populations. However, research is needed on effective strategies for linking smokers to services, how to couple financial incentives with telehealth, and on how to scale this to population-level practice. The current paper evaluates primary implementation and follow-up results of two strategies for connecting low-income, predominantly female smokers to a telephone tobacco quitline (QL). The population-based program consisted of participant-initiated phone contact and two recruitment strategies: (1) direct mail (DM) and (2) opportunistic telephone referrals with connection (ORC). Both strategies offered financial incentives for being connected to the QL, and all QL connections were made by trained patient navigators through a central call center. QL connections occurred for 97% of DM callers (N. =. 870) and 33% of ORC callers (N. =. 4550). Self-reported continuous smoking abstinence (i.e., 30 smoke-free days at seven-month follow-up) was 20% for the DM group and 16% for ORC. These differences between intervention groups remained in ordered logistic regressions adjusting for smoking history and demographic characteristics. Each recruitment strategy had distinct advantages; both successfully connected low-income smokers to cessation services and encouraged quit attempts and continuous smoking abstinence. Future research and population-based programs can utilize financial incentives and both recruitment strategies, building on their relative strengths. © 2015 ."

We explored where women plan to get their future contraception, pelvic exam/pap smears, and sexually transmitted infection testing, with a focus on the role of family planning clinics. Methods: Data were drawn from a study of United States adults conducted in January 2013 from a national online panel. We focused on English-literate women aged 18-45 years who answered items on intended sources of care (private office/health maintenance organization [HMO], family planning clinic, other, would not get care) for reproductive health services. We used Rao-Scott F tests to compare intended sources across sociodemographic groups, and logistic regression to model odds of intending to use family planning clinics. Probability weights were used to adjust for the complex sampling design. Results: The response rate was 61% (n = 2,182). Of the 723 respondents who met the inclusion criteria, approximately half intended to use private offices/HMOs. Among some subgroups, including less educated (less than high school), lower annual incomes (<$25,000) and uninsured women, the proportion intending to use family planning clinics was higher than the proportion intending to use private office/HMO in unadjusted analyses. Across all service types, unmarried and uninsured status were associated with intention to use family planning clinics in multivariable models. Conclusions: While many women intend to use private offices/HMOs for their reproductive health care, family planning clinics continue to play an important role, particularly for socially disadvantaged women. © 2016 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc."

Methodology/approach - Using National Latino and Asian American Study (2004) data, we apply Andersen's (1995) Behavioral Model of Health Services Use to assess how preventive care use among Asian and Latino men and women varies as a function of predisposing, enabling, and need-based characteristics. We explore whether adjustment for these factors mediates gender disparities in both physical and dental/optical check-ups, and test whether certain factors operate differently among men versus women. Findings - A higher proportion of women reported a routine care visit last year, especially among Latinos. Adjusting for predisposing, enabling, and need-based factors explained the gender difference in reporting a dental/optician check-up, but not a physical check-up, among both Asian and Latino adults. Research limitations/implications - Our findings illustrate how gender patterns in routine care use differ by race/ethnicity, and highlight the fundamental importance of enabling characteristics (especially health insurance and having a regular doctor) for shaping routine care use between men and women, both Asian and Latino. Limitations of this chapter are that the data are cross-sectional and were collected before the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, and measures are self-reported.

These surveys are administered by trained survey vendors, who were allowed to add any number of supplementary survey items to the core survey in 2012, as long as the items met content requirements. Vendors and health plans create these supplemental items for internal quality improvement efforts. Because the results of the core items from the surveys are publicly reported and used to calculate Medicare Quality Bonus Payments to health plans under the Affordable Care Act, concern arose that an excessive number of supplementary items might adversely affect response rates and the reliability of plan-level estimates.

Descriptive statistics, Pearson chi-square test, and logistic regression were used for analysis. Results: Of the 192 eligible participants, 189 (96%) provided urine samples. Fifty-four samples were negative or indeterminate, yielding 135 participants with positive urine drug tests for this analysis: 6 tested positive for amphetamines, 18 opiates, 21 cocaine, 97 marijuana. Thirty patients (22%) under-reported drug use and 105 (78%) reported drug use accurately. Under-reporting by specific substances was: amphetamines 66%, opiates 45%, cocaine 14%, and marijuana 7%. Logistic regression revealed that under-reporting of any drug was associated with history of incarceration and older age (odds ratios 2.6 and 3.3, respectively; P<0.05). Conclusions: Under-reporting of drug use is prevalent even among self-reported drug users in primary care patients of FQHCs (22%), but varied considerably based on the substance used. Further research is indicated to assess the extent of under-reporting among all primary care patients, regardless of their self-reported drug use status.

Changes in smoking were evaluated among 18 840 current and former smokers aged 55-74 scheduled to receive three annual lung screenings. Methods: Participants were randomized to low-dose computed tomography or single-view chest radiography in the American College of Radiology/National Lung Screening Trial. Outcome measures included point and sustained (6-month) abstinence and motivation to quit among smokers; and relapse among smokers who quit during follow-up, recent quitters (quit < 6 months), and long-term former smokers (quit ≥6 months). Results: During five years of follow-up, annual point prevalence quit rates ranged from 11.6%-13.4%; 48% of current smokers reported a quit attempt and 7% of long-term former smokers relapsed. Any false positive screening result was associated with subsequent increased point (multivariable hazard ratio HR = 1.23, 95% CI = 1.13, 1.35) and sustained (HR = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.15, 1.43) abstinence among smokers. Recent quitters with ≥1 false positive screen were less likely to relapse (HR = 0.72, 95% CI = 0.54, 0.96). Screening result was not associated with relapse among long-term former smokers or among baseline smokers who quit during follow-up. Conclusions: A false positive screen was associated with increased smoking cessation and less relapse among recent quitters. Consistently negative screens were not associated with greater relapse among long-term former smokers. Given the Affordable Care Act requires most health plans to cover smoking cessation and lung screening, the impact and cost-effectiveness of lung screening could be further enhanced with the addition of smoking cessation interventions. © The Author 2015.

Methods: Philadelphia County Medicaid claims were used to identify children ages five to 17 who received behavioral health services through Medicaid any time between October 2008 and September 2009 (N=24,271). Children were categorized into four diagnostic groups: autism spectrum disorder (ASD), conduct disorder or oppositional defiant disorder (conduct-ODD), attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and other psychiatric disorders. Logistic regression analysis compared use of in-school and out-ofschool behavioral health services between children with ASD and children with other psychiatric disorders. Generalized linear models with gamma distribution were used to estimate differences in Medicaid expenditures for in-school and out-of-school services and total Medicaid expenditures for both service types by disorder, with adjustments for age, sex, and race-ethnicity. Results: The most common diagnosis was ADHD (40%); 35% had other psychiatric disorders, 21% had conduct-ODD, and 4% had ASD. A significantly greater proportion of children with ASD (52%) received in-school behavioral health services (conduct-ODD, 5%; ADHD, 8%; and other psychiatric disorders, 1.7%) Per-child expenditures for both school-based and outofschool behavioral health services were significantly higher for children with ASD than for children in the other groups. Conclusions: Medicaid represents an important source of inschool and out-of-school care for childrenwith ASD and their families. States that expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act should give careful consideration to covering school-based mental health services for children with ASD."

Lowincome, working adults who became eligible for Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act are particularly susceptible to income and employment changes that lead to churning. Objective: To compare health care use among adults who do and do not churn into and out of Medicaid. Data: Longitudinal data from 6 panels of the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. Methods: We used differences-in-differences regression to compare health care use when adults reenrolled in Medicaid following a loss of coverage, to utilization in a control group of continuously enrolled adults. Outcome Measures: Emergency department (ED) visits, ED visits resulting in an inpatient admission, and visits to office-based providers. Results: During the study period, 264 adults churned into and out of Medicaid and 627 had continuous coverage. Churning adults had an average of approximately 0.05 Medicaid-covered office-based visits per month 4 months before reenrolling in Medicaid, significantly below the rate of approximately 0.20 visits in the control group. Visits to office-based providers did not reach the control group rate until several months after churning adults had resumed Medicaid coverage. Our comparisons found no evidence of significantly elevated ED and inpatient admission rates in the churning group following reenrollment. Conclusions: Adults who lose Medicaid tend to defer their use of office-based care to periods when they are insured. Although this suggests that enrollment disruptions lead to suboptimal timing of care, we do not find evidence that adults reenroll in Medicaid with elevated acute care needs. © 2013 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc."

Study Design: A retrospective quasi-experimental evaluation of the impact of the CTS among admitted patients diagnosed with heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and/or pneumonia (CMS readmission-penalty diagnoses) in 14 acute care hospitals in Texas. The program, designed for scalable delivery, incorporated identification of high readmission-risk patients, assessment of individual needs, medication reconciliation, discharge planning, care coordination, and telephonic postdischarge follow-up. Methods: The treatment group of program enrollees (N = 560) and the comparison group with no program contact (N = 3340) were matched on 8 coarsened demographic, diagnosis, and severity variables associated with readmission risk. Assessed outcomes included relative risk and odds of readmission within 30 days postdischarge and overall within the 6-month evaluation period. Zero-inflated Poisson multivariate models were used to estimate intervention effects controlling for matching-generated weights, age, disease status, and period of evaluation. Results: Treatment group risk of readmission was 22% lower overall (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.78; P <.01) and 30-day readmission risk was 25% lower (IRR, 0.75; P = .01) relative to the comparison group. Odds of any or 30-day readmission were 0.47 (95% CI, 0.35-0.65) and 0.56 (95% CI, 0.41-0.77), respectively, for treatment relative to comparison. Conclusions: Participation in the CTS resulted in significantly lower rates of readmissions among patients with readmissionsensitive conditions, offering a scalable and sustainable approach to reduce the number of preventable hospital readmissions."

Our objective was to examine the extent to which state Medicaid expansion decisions and personal household income may be associated with individual-level racial and ethnic disparities in delayed or forgone care due to cost, at baseline, before the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. Methods: We used 2012 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System survey data to examine racial and ethnic differences in delayed or forgone care due to cost in states that do and do not plan Medicaid expansion. We examined personal household income as a social factor that could contribute to racial and ethnic disparities in delayed or forgone care. Results: We found that personal income differences were strongly related to disparities in delayed or forgone care in places with and without plans to expand Medicaid. In addition, while delayed or forgone care disparities between non-Hispanic whites and non-Hispanic blacks were lowest in places with plans to expand Medicaid access, disparities between non-Hispanic whites and Hispanics did not differ by state Medicaid expansion plans. Conclusions: As access to insurance improves for diverse groups, health systems must develop innovative strategies to overcome social determinants of health, including income inequities, as barriers to accessing care for Hispanic and non-Hispanic blacks. Additional efforts may be needed to ensure Hispanic groups achieve the benefits of investments in health care access. © 2013 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved."

Traditionally, these home based services have been referred to as ""home health."" As more Americans have retired, home health services have expanded and are readily accessible. This growth put tremendous stress on the Medicare fund which pays for senior care services. However, ""Home Care,"" which traditionally has been viewed as non-medical home based services, has also become a booming industry for the cost conscious in recent years as more Americans reach retirement age. With the passing of the Affordable Care Act in 2010, providers and payers are now finding themselves responsible for post-acute care and continuous patient health, so cost efficient solutions for post-acute care are thriving. For the first time in history, American hospitals and Insurers are recognizing Home Care as an effective model that achieves the Triple Aim of Health Care reform. Home Care, which is no longer completely non-medical services, has proven to be an integral part of the care continuum for seniors in recent years and is now becoming a viable solution for keeping patients well, while still honoring their desire to age and heal at home. This paper analyzes the benefits and risks of home care and provides a clear understanding as to why American hospitals are emphasizing SNF Avoidance and skipping home health, opting instead to refer patients directly to home care as the preferred discharge solution in a value based model."

Little is known, however, about what local health departments (LHDs) do to address the mental health needs of the populations they serve. Using data from the 2013 National Profile of Local Health Departments - a nationally representative survey of LHDs in the United States (N = 505) - we characterized LHDs' engagement in eight mental health activities, factors associated with engagement, and estimated the proportion of the U.S. population residing in jurisdictions where these activities were performed. We used Handler's framework of the measurement of public health systems to select variables and examined associations between LHD characteristics and engagement in mental health activities using bivariate analyses and multilevel, multivariate logistic regression. Assessing gaps in access to mental healthcare services (39.3%) and implementing strategies to improve access to mental healthcare services (32.8%) were the most common mental health activities performed. LHDs that provided mental healthcare services were significantly more likely to perform population-based mental illness prevention activities (adjusted odds ratio: 7.1; 95% CI: 5.1, 10.0) and engage in policy/advocacy activities to address mental health (AOR: 3.9; 95% CI: 2.7, 5.6). Our study suggests that many LHDs are engaged in activities to address mental health, ranging from healthcare services to population-based interventions, and that LHDs that provide healthcare services are more likely than others to perform mental health activities. These findings have implications as LHDs reconsider their roles in the era of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and LHD accreditation. © 2015 Elsevier Inc."

Fast-turnaround household surveys fill some of the void in data on recent changes to insurance coverage, but they lack the historical data that allow analysts to account for trends that predate the ACA, economic fluctuations, and earlier public program expansions when predicting how many people would be uninsured without comprehensive health care reform. Using data from the Current Population Survey (CPS) from 2000 to 2012 and the Health Reform Monitoring Survey (HRMS) data for 2013 and 2015, this article develops an approach to estimate the number of people who would be uninsured in the absence of the ACA and isolates the change in coverage as of March 2015 that can be attributed to the ACA. We produce counterfactual forecasts of the number of uninsured absent the ACA for 9 age-income groups and compare these estimates with 2015 estimates based on HRMS relative coverage changes applied to CPS-based population estimates. As of March 2015, we find the ACA has reduced the number of uninsured adults by 18.1 million compared with the number who would have been uninsured at that time had the law not been implemented. That decline represents a 46% reduction in the number of nonelderly adults without insurance. The approach developed here can be applied to other federal data and timely surveys to provide a range of estimates of the overall effects of reform. © The Author(s) 2016."

However, new policy initiatives in the U.S., including the Affordable Care Act, may help launch widespread implementation. While the nationwide Veterans Health Administration (VA) has achieved high rates of documented alcohol screening and brief intervention, research has identified quality problems with both. We conducted a qualitative key informant study to describe local implementation of alcohol screening and brief intervention from the perspectives of frontline adopters in VA primary care in order to understand the process of implementation and factors underlying quality problems. Methods: A purposive snowball sampling method was used to identify and recruit key informants from 5 VA primary care clinics in the northwestern U.S. Key informants completed 20-30 minute semi-structured interviews, which were recorded, transcribed, and qualitatively analyzed using template analysis. Results: Key informants (N = 32) included: clinical staff (n = 14), providers (n = 14), and administrative informants (n = 4) with varying participation in implementation of and responsibility for alcohol screening and brief intervention at the medical center. Ten inter-related themes (5 a priori and 5 emergent) were identified and grouped into 3 applicable domains of Greenhalgh's conceptual framework for dissemination of innovations, including values of adopters (theme 1), processes of implementation (themes 2 and 3), and post-implementation consequences in care processes (themes 4-10). While key informants believed alcohol use was relevant to health and important to address, the process of implementation (in which no training was provided and electronic clinical reminders ""just showed up"") did not address critical training and infrastructure needs. Key informants lacked understanding of the goals of screening and brief intervention, believed referral to specialty addictions treatment (as opposed to offering brief intervention) was the only option for following up on a positive screen, reported concern regarding limited availability of treatment resources, and lacked optimism regarding patients' interest in seeking help. Conclusions: Findings suggest that the local process of implementing alcohol screening and brief intervention may have inadequately addressed important adopter needs and thus may have ultimately undermined, instead of capitalized on, staff and providers' belief in the importance of addressing alcohol use as part of primary care. Additional implementation strategies, such as training or academic detailing, may address some unmet needs and help improve the quality of both screening and brief intervention. However, these strategies may be resource-intensive and insufficient for comprehensively addressing implementation barriers. © 2015."

It has provided coverage to millions of Americans who previously lacked it, outlawed discrimination in the insurance marketplace, and armed patients with consumer-based tools to streamline their care. The ACA has had a positive impact throughout the country. But it can only go so far. Separate from providing access, the most daunting challenge facing American health care, and Medicare in particular, is how to control expenditures and utilization in an era of unprecedented enrollment growth. Past efforts to control expenditure and utilization have failed, and starkly conflict with the dominant paradigm in American health care that sanctifies the autonomy and nearly unlimited discretion of the American health care provider. This paradigm often views attempts that seek cost-effectiveness as heavyhanded government intervention. But as Medicare's enrollment is likely to swell from 52 million today to nearly 90 million by 2040, the costs and utilization problem will not abate with age. While the AC A may help reduce unnecessary and unwanted care and expand coverage, it cannot fully address the overtreatment problem due to a confluence of factors-namely, the often-acute emergent situations and incomparable pain patients encounter, the imperfect agency relationship between patients and payers, and the intractable information asymmetry that exists within the enterprise. This challenge begs for creative legal and policy-based solutions that seek to maintain provider autonomy and patients' freedom of choice, but also construct reasonable incentives and limitations to prod providers and Medicare beneficiaries into choosing more cost-effective treatments. It is made all the more difficult by Medicare's reimbursement structure, a regime that still largely rewards and incentivizes excess. Recognizing that tension, this piece nods to previous scholarship that has suggested importing fiduciary principles into the provider-patient relationship, but builds on it by arguing for the inculcation of fiduciary principles into the largely unrecognized payer-provider relationship. Requiring the provider to owe a duty of loyalty to the payers in the Medicare enterprise-American taxpayers-would introduce pressures on providers to limit excessive and expensive health care by opening the door for Medicare to seek judicial remedies in cases of wrongdoing. This new duty would further nuance the provider's loyalties and also reflect other professionals' multilayered duties of loyalty. Finally, this move would not increase regulations governing providers, nor rob them of their dear autonomy, but would limit unreasonable health care costs and utilization where possible-something that, heretofore, Medicare has failed to do.

We apply the Peters-Belson (PB) methodology to assess trends in disparities between blacks and whites in breast and colorectal cancer screening rates in the United States from 2000 to 2010. During this time period, the screening environment has changed for these screening modalities. Methods: Cancer screening data collected in Cancer Control Supplements to the US National Health Interview Survey during 2000, 2003, 2005, 2008, and 2010 were used to estimate disparities between blacks and whites. Using the PB method, logistic regression models with selected covariates were fit to the white sample for each year, sex, and type of screening. The unexplained part of the observed disparity was estimated by the average difference between the expected (from the models) and the observed rates for blacks. Weighted least squares linear regression was used to analyze the trend in unexplained disparities. Results: The black rates were generally lower than white rates for both screening tests. Observed mammogram rates for women ages 50-74 years declined slightly for whites with little trend for blacks. There was no statistical trend in the unexplained disparity. Colorectal cancer screening rates among men and women ages 50-75 years increased for both races. The unexplained disparity decreased over time for women (2.98 to-2.00; P = 0.03) and nonsignificantly increased for men (5.1 to 8.6; P = 0.62). Higher education, health insurance, and a usual source of care were significantly predictive of cancer screening between 2000 and 2010. Conclusions: Over the period we studied, screening rates in the United States increased for colorectal cancer but were stable or declining slightly for mammography. Our PB analysis provides evidence that the unexplained disparity in colorectal screening among women decreased between 2000 and 2010. It is important to continue to study trends over time to evaluate whether the Affordable Care Act will reduce the unexplained disparity for cancer screening in subgroups of the population by increasing insurance coverage and usual source of care among all Americans. © 2013 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Exchanges are marketplaces where individuals and small businesses can shop for and purchase private health insurance coverage. States must have two types of exchanges: an individual exchange and a small business health options program (SHOP) exchange. Exchanges may be established either by the state itself as a statebased exchange (SBE) or by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) as a federally-facilitated exchange (FFE). In states with FFEs, the exchange may be operated solely by the federal government or in conjunction with the state. Persons who obtain coverage through the individual exchange may be eligible for financial assistance from the federal government. The financial assistance in the individual exchanges is available in two forms: premium tax credits and cost-sharing subsidies. Small businesses that use the SHOP exchange may be eligible for small business health insurance tax credits. The tax credits assist small businesses with the cost of providing health insurance coverage to employees. The ACA generally requires that health insurance plans offered through an exchange are Qualified Health Plans (QHPs). Typically in order to be a certified as a QHP, a plan must offer the essential health benefits, comply with cost-sharing limits, and meet certain market reforms. Exchanges may also offer other types of health insurance plans such as catastrophic and dental-only plans. This report provides an overview of the various components of the health insurance exchanges. The report includes summary information about how exchanges are structured, the intended consumers for health insurance exchange plans, and consumer assistance available in the exchanges, as specified in the ACA. The report also describes the availability of financial assistance for certain exchange consumers and small businesses and outlines the range of plans offered through exchanges.

Formally, the avoidance canon is understood as a method for resolving interpretive ambiguities: if there are two equally plausible readings of a statute, and one of them raises constitutional concerns, judges are instructed to choose the other one. Yet in challenges to the Affordable Care Act, the Voting Rights Act, the Chemical Weapons Convention, and other major statutes, the Supreme Court has used this canon to adopt interpretations that are not plausible. Jurists, scholars, and legal commentators have criticized these decisions, claiming that they amount to unaccountable judicial lawmaking. These criticisms highlight a basic contradiction in contemporary avoidance doctrine. On the one hand, the avoidance canon is described as an interpretive rule of thumb that guides courts in discerning congressional intent. Yet on the other, the Supreme Court commonly uses the avoidance canon to create statutory meanings that conflict with Congress’s intent, and does so in the name of new constitutional rules that Congress did not foresee. This is not “interpretation” in the conventional sense; it is rewriting in the service of constitutional norm enforcement. This Article mounts a new defense of such rewriting-as-interpretation. It does so by reframing the avoidance canon as two different judicial tools: (1) a canon of interpretation, and (2) a constitutional remedy. The latter of these— avoidance as a constitutional remedy—makes sense of courts’ power to effectively rewrite statutes. A court that finds a statute unconstitutional can creatively reinterpret that statute in a way that changes its meaning in order to fix the constitutional violation, just as it can invalidate statutory language, strike down applications, and impose other kinds of remedies that change the statute’s meaning. This idea is not as unusual as it may seem. Many other countries currently treat avoidance as a constitutional remedy. In the United Kingdom and New Zealand, for example, judges cannot invalidate laws, and so creative reinterpretation of statutes is the only judicial mechanism for remedying violations of constitutional rights. And in Canada, constitutional avoidance doctrine has been divided into an interpretive canon and a remedy, exactly as this Article advocates. Further, the Supreme Court of the United States has effectively treated avoidance as a remedy in two major recent decisions— United States v. Booker and National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius—though it did not acknowledge that it was doing so. Bifurcating avoidance into a canon and a remedy resolves the contradiction between avoidance as an interpretive tool and avoidance as a means of changing the law. It does so by separating out these two functions. The interpretive avoidance canon can be used to resolve true ambiguities through the presumption that Congress does not intend to pass statutes that conflict with preexisting constitutional rules. The reinterpretation remedy, in turn, can be used to change a statute’s meaning after it has been held unconstitutional, and to do so even where the court is announcing a new constitutional rule. © 2016.
