2,https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/02/06/morning-agenda-a-shrug-at-puerto-ricos-debt-downgrade/,2/6/14,"Standard & Poor<U+2019>s lowered Puerto Rico<U+2019>s credit rating to junk status on Tuesday, but on Wednesday, the market responded with barely a flinch. While prices of some of the island<U+2019>s bonds traded lower, there was nothing close to the kind of mass sell-off that might indicate a panic, Michael Corkery reports in DealBook.Investors have been anticipating the downgrade of Puerto Rico<U+2019>s debt for months, and many firms, like BlackRock, have reduced their Puerto Rico exposure to soften the blow of just such an event. Other investors including hedge funds and private equity firms see an opportunity in the steep drop in prices of the bonds, though the prices have not dropped far enough to justify a buying spree.In any case, most investors continue to have confidence in the island<U+2019>s ability to pay back its debts because of a longstanding bargain: Investors have lent Puerto Rico billions of dollars in the past, and, as a result, the island<U+2019>s bonds have generated extremely high returns. And though the bargain has become precarious, with the downgrade causing a cash squeeze for the commonwealth, some large investors still say they have faith that the island<U+2019>s government won<U+2019>t let them down. STILL NO VERDICT IN SAC INSIDER TRADING TRIAL <U+00A0>|<U+00A0> After its second day of deliberating, the jury in the insider trading trial of Mathew Martoma, a former portfolio manager at SAC Capital Advisors, still has not reached a verdict. The day<U+2019>s most notable development was that the jury of seven women and five men requested the transcript of testimony supporting the defense<U+2019>s claim that Mr. Martoma was not guilty. But even this move should be taken lightly, as lawyers cautioned that predicting how a jury will vote based on evidence requests is difficult and can lead to erroneous conclusions, Alexandra Stevenson and Rachel Abrams write in DealBook. The jury will continue deliberating on Thursday morning.CURRENCY TRADING IN FLUX <U+00A0>|<U+00A0> As the banking industry continues to grapple with a series of investigations of potential manipulation of the currency markets, foreign exchange desks are looking a bit thin. More than a dozen currency traders at some of the world<U+2019>s largest banks, including Barclays, UBS and JPMorgan Chase, have been placed on leave over questions about whether they colluded to manipulate the $5-trillion-a-day currency market. Deutsche Bank fired the head of its emerging markets foreign exchange trading desk in New York and two traders just this week.And some executives at prominent financial institutions like Citigroup and Goldman Sachs have simply had enough. Anil Prasad, the global head of Citigroup<U+2019>s foreign exchange and local markets operations, is leaving the bank to <U+201C>pursue other interests<U+201D> while Steven Cho, the global head of Goldman<U+2019>s Group of 10 nations spot and forward trading group, is retiring.The moves come as many of the world<U+2019>s largest banks are facing inquiries from regulators in Britain, the United States and other parts of the world regarding potential manipulation of foreign exchange rates. On that note, New York State<U+2019>s financial regulator, Benjamin M. Lawsky, recently began an investigation into whether more than a dozen banks manipulated the price of foreign currencies, bringing the global inquiry to our doorsteps.A.I.G. SEEKS TO DELAY BANK OF AMERICA MORTGAGE SETTLEMENT <U+00A0>|<U+00A0> The American International Group seems determined to upend the $8.5 billion settlement between Bank of America and a group of 22 mortgage securities investors, most of which was approved last Friday. On Tuesday, A.I.G.<U+2019>s lawyers filed papers in New York State Supreme Court seeking to delay final approval of the deal.At the center of the lawsuit are more than 500 mortgage-backed securities involving troubled loans issued by Countrywide Financial. The investors, who held these bonds, agreed to settle their claims with Bank of America, which acquired Countrywide in 2008. But A.I.G., another investor in the bonds, refused to sign the settlement, arguing that the sum represented only a fraction of the overall losses and that the trustee for the bonds, Bank of New York Mellon, shirked its responsibility in pushing for more money in the settlement.

3,https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/07/14/morning-agenda-citigroup-in-7-billion-settlement/,7/14/14,"Citigroup and the Justice Department have agreed to a $7 billion deal that will settle a federal investigation into the mortgage securities the bank sold in the run-up to the financial crisis, Michael Corkery writes in DealBook. The deal, announced on Monday morning, includes a $4 billion cash penalty to the Justice Department <U+2012> the largest payment of its kind <U+2012> as well as $2.5 billion in so-called soft dollars earmarked for aiding struggling consumers and $500 million to state attorneys general and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The bank, which is scheduled to announce second-quarter earnings at 8 a.m., said the settlement would result in a pretax charge of $3.8 billion before taxes in the period.The deal caps months of contentious talks that began with a $363 million offer by Citigroup followed by a $12 billion demand from the Justice Department, a gap that stemmed from the radically divergent methods used to calculate the cost of the settlement, DealBook<U+2019>s Ben Protess, Jessica Silver-Greenberg and Michael Corkery write. Citigroup linked its initial offer to the bank<U+2019>s relatively small share of the market for mortgage securities. But the Justice Department rejected that argument, emphasizing instead what it saw as Citigroup<U+2019>s level of culpability based on incriminating emails and other evidence it had uncovered.The Justice Department was prepared in June to announce a lawsuit against Citigroup as negotiations with the bank stalled. But the capture of a suspect in the deadly attack in Benghazi, Libya, led federal prosecutors to postpone the announcement, opening the door to further negotiations. The main breakthrough toward a settlement took a simple feat of accounting: The bank agreed to shift a portion of the settlement from state attorneys general to the Justice Department, preventing Citigroup from claiming a tax deduction on the settlement.ABBVIE IMPROVES BID FOR SHIRE  |  The Irish drug maker Shire said on Monday that its board was prepared to recommend an improved takeover bid of 53.20 pounds a share, the equivalent of about $53 billion, that it received over the weekend from AbbVie, Chad Bray writes in DealBook. The latest offer is the fifth revised bid by AbbVie, which is based in Chicago.The deal, if completed, would allow AbbVie to reincorporate in Britain and save millions of dollars in taxes, a process known as an inversion. Shire has its headquarters in Ireland and is listed in London. AbbVie is hoping to reach a deal for Shire before July 18, when it will have to make a firm offer or walk away for up to six months under British takeover rules.SWEET DEAL  |  The Swiss chocolate maker Chocoladefabriken Lindt & Spr<U+00FC>ngli said on Monday that it had reached an agreement to acquire Russell Stover Candies, the American maker of boxed chocolates, Chad Bray writes in DealBook.

As a result of the deal, Lindt said it expected to reach annual revenue of $1.5 billion in North America in 2015.ON THE AGENDA  |  Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, testifies on economic and monetary development before the European Parliament<U+2019>s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs at 1:30 p.m. in Strasbourg, France. Happy Bastille Day. DEBT SETTLEMENT COMPANIES UNDER FIRE  |  The debt settlement industry, already accused of questionable tactics related to mortgages, has found a gold mine of new customers: those with student debt, Rachel Abrams and Jessica Silver-Greenberg write in DealBook. Federal and state regulators are now finding new instances of abuse as these debt settlement companies shift from mortgage and credit card debt to student loans.On Monday, Illinois is expected to become the first state to bring legal action against debt settlement companies in connection with their student loan practices, contending in two separate lawsuits that Broadsword Student Advantage and First American Tax Defense duped vulnerable borrowers into paying for help that never arrived. The companies often misled customers about fees, according to the suits, and in some instances feigned affiliation with federal relief programs. In some cases, the Illinois attorney general contends, the companies charged customers for debt assistance that they could have received free from the Education Department.  |  Contact: @melbournecoal | E-mailSign up for the DealBook Newsletter, delivered every morning and afternoon.<U+00A0>Merger of Tobacco Rivals Faces a Fight  |  A deal between Reynolds American and Lorillard would unite the makers of the Camel and Newport brands and reshape the industry by creating a more formidable rival to the Altria Group, home of Marlboro.

4,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/04/jindalcare-and-the-g-o-p-dilemma/,4/4/14,"On Monday, I wrote that the apparent stabilization of Obamacare sharpens the political and policy challenge facing the law<U+2019>s critics. Instead of the sort of easy unraveling that some Republicans had convinced themselves was in the offing, I argued (in a point made rather<U+00A0>more forcefully by Ramesh Ponnuru) that<U+00A0>it<U+2019>s now much more likely that the only way the things conservatives dislike about Obamacare will ever change or go away is if conservatives actually unite around reforms or a replacement that sustains some of the current law<U+2019>s coverage expansion (albeit on significantly different terms).My sense is that some Republicans half-agree. That is, they<U+2019>re willing to concede that the party needs an Obamacare replacement that<U+2019>s more serious than some of the G.O.P.<U+2019>s circa-2009 alternatives. But they also think the law will remain so unpopular, and that the number of losers will exceed the number of winners so dramatically, that conservative policymakers will have more room to maneuver, in terms of the initial coverage numbers a replacement might sustain, than my reading of the situation would suggest.The health care reform proposal rolled out by Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal this week offers a<U+00A0>specific example of how this perspective cashes out. Unlike some other recent Republican proposals (most notably, the bill co-sponsored in the Senate earlier this year), which promise tax cuts and savings relative to current policy, Jindal<U+2019>s proposal explicitly starts with the 2008 baseline, and promises not to tax or spend a dollar more. His proposed reform would convert the open-ended deduction for employer-provided insurance into a flat deduction, extend the same deduction to people outside the employer market, and channel $100 billion over ten years to the states to provide for high-risk pools and other measures to help cover people with pre-existing conditions.<U+00A0>What it conspicuously wouldn<U+2019>t do is create the kind of tax credit for catastrophic coverage that you<U+2019>ll often find in right-of-center health care alternatives<U+00A0><U+2014><U+00A0>because that would cost money relative to the 2008 baseline, and/or require further disruptions elsewhere in the system. Which means, in turn, that if you replaced Obamacare with Jindalcare in 2017, you<U+2019>d see a coverage expansion relative to the Bush era, but a large number of the newly-insured would lose coverage without any immediate prospect of regaining it.Jindal was in D.C. yesterday to talk about his plan (full disclosure, I was there), and the Washington Examiner<U+2019>s Philip Klein has a good write-up of how he responded to, shall we say, pushback on this point:Jindal was pressed on why he chose to offer a tax deduction for individuals to purchase insurance rather than a refundable tax credit. Supporters of the tax credit approach argue that it would benefit more people, because lower-income Americans don<U+2019>t pay enough taxes for the deduction to be valuable enough to make insurance premiums affordable.He said that he decided on the deduction approach because relying on tax credits would be so costly that it would require tax increases <U+2013> and Jindal doesn<U+2019>t want his plan to spend more or tax more than the system that existed prior to Obamacare<U+2019>s passage. He also argued that credits would cause more disruption to the employer-based market and would be more prone to fraud.He said that whatever amounts of money conservatives were willing to allocate to address a problem, Democrats would always be willing to spend more, so conservatives cannot get into a bidding war.Jindal cited previous estimates of similar reform proposals to his own, which he said could reduce family health insurance premiums by $5,000 annually and increase coverage by 9 million people relative to the number of people who were covered prior to Obamacare.<U+201C>I don<U+2019>t think conservative health care reform is about saying we<U+2019>re going to compete with them in terms of how many people we say have an insurance card,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>That<U+2019>s not the ultimate goal.<U+201D>So obviously the governor and I have a substantive disagreement here: Like Jindal, I<U+2019>m deeply skeptical of the <U+201C>give everyone a Medicaid card<U+201D> approach to health care reform, but that skepticism pushes me toward supporting a basic catastrophic protection (and other reforms) instead, rather than toward just accepting, for the foreseeable future, a health insurance marketplace that prices a lot of working class Americans out of affordable coverage of any sort.But for the purposes of this post, I<U+2019>m more interested in the politics of the debate. Politically, I don<U+2019>t think there<U+2019>s any question that Jindal<U+2019>s argument <U+2014> go back to the pre-Obamacare baseline, expand coverage modestly relative to that <U+2014><U+00A0>would play well with at least part of the G.O.P. electorate in a primary campaign. For a case, contra myself and Ponnuru, that it could also play pretty well in the general election and in a subsequent legislative battle, here<U+2019>s Ben Domenech, writing in yesterday<U+2019>s edition of his newsletter The Transom:<U+2026> when President Obama sold his health care law to the American people, he sold it to them primarily on the basis of cost. He did this because the polling was so unanimous: people weren<U+2019>t demanding massive increased regulation of the insurance marketplace to achieve any particular moral goal about coverage levels or anything of the sort <U+2013> the vast majority of Americans just cared that their premiums cost too much. So Obama made the case for his law based not on increasing coverage, but on decreasing costs <U+2013> and along the way, he promised that no one would lose their doctor, their plan, or see worse coverage because of his law. In each case, his case was in line with the polling data on what the American people wanted.But what about making the case for health policy reforms in the post-Obamacare era? For most center-right health policy experts and opinion-makers, the assumption has taken hold that coverage levels must be sustained or even increased under any comparable reform. They believe the argument in favor of universal coverage has been lost, and that any plan which kicks people off of an entitlement program is doomed to fail, politically.This is an assumption held by most people in Washington and the media. But I wonder how accurate it is. Post-Obamacare polling data on this question is lacking, but given the behavior of so many individuals and entities in reaction to Obamacare it<U+2019>s possible that the bulk of Americans still hold the same views they did prior to the law<U+2019>s passage: that they want to retain their current plans, that they dislike disruption in their insurance experience, but that most of all, they want lower costs for themselves, not broader coverage for everybody else.I agree that support for universal coverage has tended to be soft, rising when it seems theoretical and then diminishing when the trade-offs actually present themselves. But my expectation is that with Obamacare in place, the psychology of loss aversion changes this calculus in two ways. First, indirectly <U+2014><U+00A0>because it seems worse to most people to lose a benefit than to have never enjoyed it, voters will feel more morally uncomfortable supporting a candidate who promises to strip other people<U+2019>s coverage than they would have felt voting for a candidate who opposed the expansion originally. And second, directly<U+00A0><U+2014> because over the next few years, even voters who dislike Obamacare and aren<U+2019>t getting subsidies are likely to internalize the idea that they now have an additional backstop in the event of job-loss or illness, and so voting to roll the program back completely and start afresh without that backstop will, again, be more unpopular than never creating it in the first place would have been. (The consistent presence, in most polls, of an anti-Obamacare demographic that prefer changes to outright repeal suggests to me that the idea of maintaining some kind of quasi-universal guarantee has relatively strong appeal.)I<U+2019>d also make a broader point: Yes, the health care law remains unpopular, but it was unpopular in 2012 as well, and the economy was worse, and the Republican nominee still went down to defeat<U+00A0><U+2014> not least, I would submit, because of the perception that he couldn<U+2019>t be trusted to safeguards the interests of the non-rich. So even if people generally care more about cost than coverage, it still seems quite likely that this fatal impression of the party<U+2019>s priorities would be accentuated, rather than diminished, in a 2016 campaign where the Republican nominee would be quite directly promising to drive the uninsured rate up.My expectation could be confounded, I concede, if the next few years are a true disaster of spiking premiums and stagnant newly-insured numbers. And<U+00A0>I would certainly agree with Domenech that the structure of the law is a lot more vulnerable than exuberant liberals seem to think this week.But I also think that in political terms, it<U+2019>s actually slightly crazy for Republicans to bet this way given the other options available to them. The Jindal theory, that the right shouldn<U+2019>t bother competing with liberals on certain policy fronts because they<U+2019>ll always be outbid, is generally problematic (why does his proposal have any coverage expansion, then?) but it<U+2019>s a particularly odd idea to embrace in a case where the liberal program may not, as even its defenders allow, actually end up delivering the scale of coverage expansion that was expected.By which I mean that if the current enrollment trends persist, there is a good chance that some version of a more catastrophic-focused reform could actually enroll somewhat more Americans in some kind of basic coverage than Obamacare, at a substantially lower cost. (A preliminary private score of the Senate Republican bill suggested it could get slightly higher coverage numbers, and that was <U+2014> I believe<U+00A0><U+2014><U+00A0>using the C.B.O. projections for Obamacare, which may turn out to have been too high.) Which in turn would offer Republicans an opportunity to effectively outbid the Democrats on enrollment while significantly<U+00A0>underbidding them on spending. (The Democrats could, of course, counter with single-payer <U+2014> but the G.O.P. should<U+00A0>want<U+00A0>to provoke that debate!) And to pass up that unusual opportunity in favor of a probably-doomed fidelity to a nearly decade-old baseline <U+2026> well, I suppose it would be very much like the Republican Party I<U+2019>ve come to know and love so well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,https://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/12/22/student-winners-from-our-2015-review-contest/,12/22/15,"Back in October we challenged teenagers to go out and experience works of culture that were new to them, then write about it for our first Review Contest. Over 1,600 students took us up on the offer, and, since our rules stated that they could choose any genre of creative work reviewed by The Times, below you<U+2019>ll find submissions on everything from <U+201C>South Park<U+201D> to Mozart; an American Airlines on-board meal to a graphic novel about Jeffrey Dahmer; a video game that <U+201C>dismantles the fluid morality of other RPGs<U+201D> to a Valentino ready-to-wear show that <U+201C>interweaves the diverse cultures<U+201D> of Africa and Italy.Congratulations to our nine winners, nine runners-up and 22 honorable mentions, listed in alphabetical order below. Please visit our calendar to see what other contests we<U+2019>re running this year. WinnersRunners-UpHonorable MentionsWinners<U+201C><U+2018>Futurity': Innovative Exploration of the Civil War<U+201D>Toby Berggruen, age 15Imagine a man born in the Civil War who lives to see the first men walk on the moon in 1969. A fictional correspondence between a Union soldier and the first computer scientist. A steam-powered brain that brings world peace. That is the challenge of the play <U+201C>Futurity,<U+201D> a strange alchemy of music, history, fiction and philosophy. The premise may be absurd but the questions are urgent and real, as pressing today as they were in the 1860s.Presented at the intimate Connelly Theater on the Lower East Side, this co-production between the Soho Rep and Ars Nova opens in the thick of the Civil War. <U+201C>Futurity<U+201D> tells the story of Julian Munro, a fictional soldier portrayed by its creator, C<U+00E9>sar Alvarez. Through Munro, we delve into the brutal realities of wartime America, and the prescient imagination of a lone soldier. Finding himself in the midst of a world abound with pain and suffering, Munro begins to imagine a solution to human conflict, a mechanical machine that will bridge the humanities and sciences, accomplishing world peace. In his search, he begins a correspondence with Ada Lovelace, a remarkable mathematician played by the forceful, exuberant Sammy Tunis. The sagacious brilliance of Lovelace seamlessly meshes with the idealist Munro, who exudes hope and creative energy. The two grapple with issues both personal and universal as they embark on a journey into an opaque realm of invention and morality.Mr. Alvarez deserves much praise for his impassioned performance; his display showcases wit, confidence and rich voice. The play<U+2019>s music combines powerful folk song with the edge and nonconformity of a David Byrne song. Its lyrics are themselves masterful <U+2014> aphoristic, poignant and true <U+2014> profuse with existential questions such as, <U+201C>Is morality made of information?<U+201D> Directed by Sarah Benson, all aspects of <U+201C>Futurity<U+201D> mesh together with ease and intensity, combining effortless choreography and rich set design. <U+201C>Futurity<U+201D> asks questions, questions that make us think deeply about who we really are. They are certainly too vast to list, but one question keeps ringing in my mind: How to solve unsolvable problems? Is it possible to solve the unspeakable evil of our world? How? Through a synthesis of the perfection of the mathematical world and the depths of art, as <U+201C>Futurity<U+201D> suggests? As the General touchingly reminds us, <U+201C>I believe that this body is all I have, and that it<U+2019>ll take more than a war to make it safe.<U+201D> What will it take to solve racial inequality? Not just a war. <U+201C>Futurity<U+201D> combines a vast plethora of subjects with sensitivity and depth, from art, to science, to philosophy. It directly tackles notions of morality, time and singularity <U+2014> to name a few <U+2014> and leaves us asking more questions than it answers.<U+201C>Falling, Failing, Flying<U+201D>Rachel Liu, age 13<U+201C>Will Grayson, meet Will Grayson.<U+201D>The authors David Levithan and John Green (infamously nerdy YA authors of the century) piece together the confusion of meeting someone else with your name and a hilariously realistic comedy featuring a big gay guy, his best friend, another gay guy, and the most fabulous play to ever grace the high school stage.Will 1 is stuck. He<U+2019>s stuck in school, life, and also with Tiny Cooper, who is his (only if you must) best friend. He copes by following two simple but catastrophic rules: 1 <U+2014>Don<U+2019>t care too much. 2 <U+2014>Shut up. His views on Tiny are also simple: <U+201C>Tiny Cooper is not the world<U+2019>s gayest person, and he is not the world<U+2019>s largest person, but I believe he may be the world<U+2019>s largest person who is really, really gay, and also the world<U+2019>s gayest person who is really, really large.<U+201D>Then there<U+2019>s Will 2: alive, but somehow not; seeing, but somehow not. He<U+2019>s <U+201C>constantly torn between killing myself<U+201D> and <U+201C>killing everyone around me,<U+201D> but surviving, solely depending on his friend Isaac for comfort.It<U+2019>s their job to turn each other<U+2019>s lives around by meeting in an abandoned corner tucked away in Chicago.There<U+2019>s something magical about the book: making friends and living inside the moment and taking a risk and the feeling of being a part of something. At the same time, it<U+2019>s not all rainbows and neon colored unicorns galloping across the pages. The two authors illustrate that with love comes pain, and maybe more love, and more pain. It<U+2019>s a dance the characters do around happiness: it doesn<U+2019>t last forever, just like Schr<U+00F6>dinger<U+2019>s Cat (another feature in the book). You either have happiness, or you don<U+2019>t. But to find out, the two Will Graysons along with their friends take a leap of faith across the pages: through fights, discoveries, and the ups and downs of life.Love is an omnipresent thing in the book. Tiny loves love. He falls in love too easily, and it<U+2019>s both his strength and weakness. Will 2 doesn<U+2019>t believe in love. Will 1 falls in love. Tiny sings about love in his play. But throughout the book, none of them know what it<U+2019>s really about. And that<U+2019>s O.K., because as Tiny said, <U+201C>Just fall for once. Let yourself fall!<U+201D>Because if there<U+2019>s one thing I have learned in this book, it<U+2019>s that falling doesn<U+2019>t mean failing. As Will Grayson 2 said, <U+201C>the world is more like try-error-try-error-try-error-try-error-try-error-try<U+2026>at least fifteen more rounds<U+2026>then try-error-try-and finally <U+2014>it.<U+201D> And it will come and hit you one day, brighter than anything you will ever see, because you will get a happy ending out of falling, and you won<U+2019>t break: you<U+2019>ll fly. <U+201C>Synecdoche, New York <U+2014> Charlie Kaufman<U+2019>s Global Oracle<U+201D>Matthew Mandel, age 16As the directorial debut of Charlie Kaufman, notable writer of such universally praised movies as <U+201C>Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind<U+201D> and <U+201C>Being John Malkovich,<U+201D> <U+201C>Synecdoche, New York<U+201D> stands as Kaufman<U+2019>s first opportunity to step out of the writer<U+2019>s chair and take the reigns of an entire theatrical release, giving him full artistic license regarding the film<U+2019>s story line, characters and overarching theme. Kaufman took advantage of this through his commentary on the mind-set of the information age and where society is headed into the future. <U+201C>We<U+2019>re all hurtling toward death, yet here we are for the moment, alive; each of us knowing we<U+2019>re going to die, each of us secretly believing we won<U+2019>t,<U+201D> says Caden Cotard, a fragile, anxious playwright, and the protagonist of <U+201C>Synecdoche, New York,<U+201D> played by Philip Seymour-Hoffman. In the film, Caden is awarded a MacArthur grant, which allows him to finally produce a masterwork which allows him to portray a pure representation of his inner workings (much like Kaufman with this movie). Unfortunately for Caden, this feat will cost him his career and his concentration, as he attempts to recreate every real-world conflict with thousands of actors and scenes within the play. All the while, he deals with issues of romance, fatherhood and aging, fully aware of the results of his every decision and the inevitability of death. Charlie Kaufman utilizes this deeply cognizant character to reflect not only himself, but also everyone living in the information age. In this all-too-nearing future, constant access to public opinion and social ridicule leaves Caden overly self-aware, to the point where he questions his every move and action in the entire movie. He allows his eye for perfection within his play do a number to his physical health, neglecting his humanity for the sake of that which he wishes to share with the world. Could this, too, be the fate of humanity? Doomed to inevitably create our own ideal worlds, where all conflicts reflect our own perspectives, to a degree of tunnel vision wherein we begin to disregard our surroundings? This corresponds both with the director and users of social media, as posts and statuses may be perfected to portray to the world one<U+2019>s best self, whether or not this may be their candid self. A book could be written on the detailed level of allegory utilized in this film, but the best place to begin searching is within the title <U+201C>Synecdoche, New York.<U+201D> Caden creates his own synecdoche, or a part meant to represent the whole, within his uncannily intricate depiction of the world at large. One thing is for sure, Charlie Kaufman<U+2019>s 2008 treasure is sure to perplex, and allow for some deep introspection and self acceptance. <U+201C>Student Short Film Leaves Longlasting Impression<U+201D>Rayna Perry, age 16The student produced short film <U+201C>Home,<U+201D> recently screened at the Savannah Film Festival, follows the story of an elderly Chinese migrant worker, watching over an abandoned construction site, scheduled for demolition. On his last day at the site, a young girl wanders into his midst, and briefly breaks through the old man<U+2019>s closed off demeanor. The film is entirely in Chinese with English subtitles, yet this hardly comes as a distraction to the viewer in ways that subtitles often can. The calm pacing and stunning cinematography mirror that of the lotus pond that rests in the center of the construction site, and acts somewhat as a centerpiece to the film itself. The chemistry of the characters stems not from what they have in common, but in how they differ. The elderly man lives a life of tedium, and struggle, while life to the young city girl, no older than six, is currently one new discovery after another. <U+201C>Home<U+201D> takes its original exploration of homelessness and poverty in modern day China to an even deeper level, as the characters are united by a common search for love and belonging. The elderly man spends most of his time away from family due to the nature of his work, and the young girl is isolated by the unhealthy relationship of her parents. The film attaches the audience to the fleeting bond between the main characters, but in a way that serves to share or inform, rather than relate to those watching the film. Even with the strong emotional pull, the abrupt and almost indifferent ending reminds the viewers that they are, indeed, only spectators. The conflict between the sobering reality of the characters and the audience<U+2019>s desire to see them meet a happy ending truly caused <U+201C>Home<U+201D> to stick with festival goers, even after seeing over a dozen other short films within that hour.  The story candidly tackles universal themes of poverty, loneliness and abandonment, contrasted with those of adventure, and unlikely friendships, without rushing or overloading the viewer. The visual and written aspects of the film are balanced out, so as not to sacrifice a good plot for the sake of showcasing beautiful cinematography, or vice versa. Not only does this standout student film expertly tell the story of a young girl and an elderly man meeting by spontaneous chance, <U+201C>Home<U+201D> prompts audiences to question the true definition of the word. <U+201C><U+2018>Undertale<U+2019> Video Game Review<U+201D>Sean Sawyer, age 14In a market where originality and innovation are rare, Toby Fox<U+2019>s <U+201C>Undertale<U+201D> achieves with one person and $50,000 what no multimillion dollar publisher could. This game is absolutely overflowing with personality, and people have taken notice. At the time of writing, this game is ranked 11th in Best PC Games of All Time on Metacritic, alongside such prestigious titles as <U+201C>Half-Life 2,<U+201D> <U+201C>BioShock<U+201D> and <U+201C>Skyrim.<U+201D> These are games by some of the most skilled designers, programmers and artists with practically infinite budgets, and one quirky little indie game manages to compete with them.At first glance, the main gimmick of <U+201C>Undertale<U+201D> is that the player can choose to kill or spare their enemies in combat. Not unique, considering how many games have similar morality systems. <U+201C>BioShock,<U+201D> <U+201C>Fallout,<U+201D> <U+201C>Mass Effect,<U+201D> and <U+201C>Dishonored<U+201D> all come to mind, but <U+201C>Undertale<U+201D> manages something none of these games had. None of these games legitimately get me to be a good person, and I don<U+2019>t feel bad about doing terrible things in them. <U+201C>Undertale<U+201D> is the first game to make it painful to be a bad person. When I started out, I played this game like I would any RPG. I didn<U+2019>t bother talking to other characters, thinking that they would probably just give me useless information. I killed the enemies that I came across, watching them disintegrate into dust in the same wholesome way that I had come to expect from RPGs. I found out later that for most people, the fight against Toriel (the mother figure who adopts you at the beginning of the story) was a turning point in their playthrough, where they started sparing everyone they could. I didn<U+2019>t have that realization. I killed Toriel, not because I particularly wanted to, but because I thought it was the way to progress the story. The whole game went on like this, and the experience was short, lonely and depressing.At this point, I looked into it some more, breaking my usual rule of not reading about a game while still playing it. I had to have missed something, right? In forum posts and reviews of the game, I found plenty of people who had done the same thing as I did. I started a pacifist playthrough, and finally I realized why people loved this game so much. The characters who I killed last time without a second thought were now friends, and the game seemed to be full of excitement and humor. There was value in being good beyond a few extra points on a karma meter. <U+201C>Undertale<U+201D> dismantles the fluid morality of other RPGs and replaces it with a system where the player<U+2019>s actions have real, substantial consequences.<U+201C><U+2018>My Friend Dahmer': The Young Life of a Murderer<U+201D>Kristina Schafer, age 17Monster. Serial killer. Sicko. I think of these images when I hear the name Jeffrey Dahmer. The terms are, unfortunately, fitting descriptions of who<U+2026> rather, what<U+2026> he came to be. In <U+201C>My Friend Dahmer,<U+201D> author Derf Backderf exposes the adolescent journey of one of the most famed serial killers of our time, from Dahmer<U+2019>s collecting roadkill as a middle-schooler to his committing murder as a newly graduated high school senior.  I picked up this graphic novel expecting a creepy back story of a murderer <U+2014> in all, seventeen young men lost their lives to his bloodlust. Instead, I was shocked to find this reality: his path could have turned in a different direction if the adults in his life had been conscious to his condition. Growing up in the 1970s, Dahmer<U+2019>s world was a bitter hell. He struggled with mental instability that drove him to private insanity as a teenager. His homosexuality was a plague worse than paralysis in an unaccepting era. And as his family split apart at home, Dahmer<U+2019>s descent into darkness became so evident that it affected his friends <U+2014> including Backderf, Dahmer<U+2019>s high school classmate. The isolation of Dahmer at school and failure on the part of his adult figures led him to find grisly methods to satisfy the emotional release he so badly needed. Backderf captures the early days of Dahmer<U+2019>s downward slope toward the brink with startling truth and blunt accuracy. This firsthand account of Dahmer<U+2019>s teenage world is expertly framed by artwork drawn in an awkward, stiff and knobby style, reflecting the insecurities of this time period in Dahmer<U+2019>s life. The shots of each panel play out with smooth synchronicity, like a movie. And what better color scheme to paint the portrait of a fractured existence than the heavy shadows of black and gray? The writer realized this idea by drenching his world in monochrome. This book was constantly in my hands until I had taken in every last picture and word. It grabbed my attention and held it until the end, and even now the story sends shivers down my spine. Because Dahmer was misunderstood, it was too easy for his condition to be overlooked. Backderf led me to see this insidious kind of tragedy: not of a troubled youth, but of an ignorant world. Dahmer devolved from human to monster when people turned away. After reading this, I was no longer tempted to be oblivious. This book leaves its handprint on the reader, no matter their background, walk of life or social standing. Dahmer<U+2019>s tale is a striking one. <U+201C>My Friend Dahmer<U+201D> is an intriguing and disturbingly entertaining read for anyone willing to enter one of history<U+2019>s darkest minds.<U+201C>Man of Mystery <U+2014> A Sherlock Review<U+201D>Maya J. Sekhar, age 14I<U+2019>ve scrutinized the novellas, screened the spinoffs, and although the beloved and brilliant Sherlock Holmes has stood the test of time, I will have to agree with co-director Stephen Moffat in saying, <U+201C>[He] hasn<U+2019>t grown old <U+2014> his times [have].<U+201D>Classic canons, the works of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle have become a commodity in the movie industry <U+2014> replicable mysteries, they are a dime-a-dozen. Would Cumberbatch be the inordinately tame John Barrymore? Or would the series turn into a 48-frame-per-second, Guy Ritchie piece? Naturally, I was dubious upon entering the series.Oh, how wrong I was. Taking place in modern-day London, a young Holmes (Benedict Cumberbatch) shares a flat with John Watson (Martin Freeman) at 221b Baker Street. Watson runs a blog and Sherlock a website. A smartphone is glued to Holmes<U+2019> side for rapid referral, and forensic science is utilized to deduce. Goodbye, telegraphs. Welcome to the 21st century, Sherlock.However, when an incognito bomber strikes Baker Street, the blas<U+00E9> Sherlock is roused from a state of intellectual-boredom, and engaged in an intense, phrenic match, as well as a race to save or sacrifice a multitudinous number of lives. Subsequently, a safe was found, revealing a phone and letter that would explain the madness. Moriarty, an old nemesis, was also consumed by ennui. <U+201C>I<U+2019>m bored,<U+201D> he cackled, <U+201C>we were made for each other, Sherlock!<U+201D>Their game of cat-and-mouse went accordingly<U+2026>. First, a Londoner would be held hostage by the criminal-mastermind, strapped to a bomb. An image, indicating a clue pertaining to a proposed case, would be sent to Holmes<U+2019> mobile. An esoteric message is conveyed from the bomber, through the victim. If the conundrum can be cracked within the allotted time, a person is spared. If not, he or she is blown to smithereens. BLAM!In nine hours<U+2026>Death by botulism is divulged.In eight hours<U+2026>An insurance fraud is exposed.In seconds<U+2026>An art heist is unveiled.Suspense aside, the complexity and relatability of the characters, was intriguing enough to keep me hooked. Tall versus small, social versus sociopath <U+2014> the contrast and chemistry of Watson and Sherlock is worth every moment. The superiority of this adaptation is found in Masterpiece<U+2019>s construction of Holmes.He tells an officer, <U+201C>I<U+2019>m not a psychopath, I<U+2019>m a high-functioning sociopath. Do your research.<U+201D>Cumberbatch is a strikingly rash, yet vulnerable Sherlock <U+2014> causing viewers to question Holmes<U+2019> motivations and mental-soundness, tugging heartstrings along the way. <U+201C>Listen, what I said before John, I meant it,<U+201D> he would mutter, <U+201C>I don<U+2019>t have friends; I<U+2019>ve just got one.<U+201D>One 90-minute-mystery is never enough. This cerebral-thriller will have young and old on the couch for the weekend, unable to pull away, hankering for more.<U+201C>Break The Routine With A Num Pang Bang<U+201D>Alexandra Strimbu, age 17Not many people like out-of-the-ordinary, especially New Yorkers. We get our bagel at the same bodega every day, shop in the same borough every week, hang out at the same park every weekend. We don<U+2019>t like to go out of our way much because we<U+2019>re busy trying to get somewhere else <U+2014> but when we stumble across something amazing, we drop the routine and savor the spontaneity of the experience.On Friday nights, I typically head to a Chipotle to finish off the week with a burrito bowl. So when I turned on 12th Street, I did not expect to find Num Pang Sandwich Shop right next to the place that awaited me. It was tiny, but it caught my eye because of the bright graffiti and the little line that definitely made me rethink mainstream <U+201C>Mexican<U+201D> food. But calling it a small sandwich shop was an understatement. Upon entering, I realized the place was a miniature flavor factory with warm, ethnic scents dancing in the air with the music that played under the soft lighting.The sandwich menu went beyond a New York BLT <U+2014> Hoisin Meatballs, Coconut Tiger Shrimp, and Ginger Barbecue Brisket were only some of the mouthwatering items listed above me. There was also a section on the menu that listed rice bowls, and since that was my original mission, I ordered one with roasted chicken. The colorful juices displayed before me also prompted me to buy their Sweet Mango juice.The bowl was larger than I expected, and was filled with colorful vegetables, chili yogurt and chive lime vinaigrette that sat upon the chicken and jasmine rice. The flavor factory truly worked its magic into every single bite. The chicken was lightly seasoned and didn<U+2019>t take away from the vegetables or dressings, which were perfectly balanced by the warm jasmine rice. The mango juice added just the right touch to the food, providing an oasis of sweetness when I took a break from the artistic blend of spices on my fork. If Chipotle and halal food had a baby, that food baby wouldn<U+2019>t compare to that Cambodian rice bowl I had not intended to buy that Friday night. I could juice my own mangoes at home, but my product would taste nowhere as refreshing as that Sweet Mango juice did.New Yorkers have been globally labeled busybodies thriving on the same old, same old. But Num Pang is not the same old ethnic food. Sometimes, having a spontaneous change of mind can really open your comfort zone in ways you<U+2019>ve never tasted. Num Pang<U+2019>s ambience and cuisine is both spontaneous and inviting <U+2014> two ingredients for any dish that<U+2019>s worth remembering.<U+201C>Leaving Listeners Wiped Out! with Emotions<U+201D>Ella Weeks, age 14Entitled <U+201C>Wiped Out!,<U+201D> The Neighbourhood<U+2019>s latest album makes a splash. This Californian band, known for wrapping together jazzy textures, smashing beats, indie style, moody lyrics and the raspy voice of Jesse Rutherford, has got the attention of both teenage girls and alternative music fans. Released on October 30th, <U+201C>Wiped Out!<U+201D> doesn<U+2019>t fail to address signature themes of California, the beach and Rutherford<U+2019>s father and ex-girlfriends <U+2014> yet explores an unexpected direction for the band. Press play, and you<U+2019>ll find you<U+2019>ve paid $1.29 for 34 seconds of silence. Whether for respect or to prolong the wait for the highly anticipated release, it starts off with the mysterious and somewhat appalling <U+201C>Moment of Silence.<U+201D> The album then plummets into a four-song mini-collection (<U+201C>Prey,<U+201D> <U+201C>Cry Baby,<U+201D> <U+201C>Wiped Out!,<U+201D> and <U+201C>The Beach<U+201D>) of Rutherford<U+2019>s identity-induced pain <U+2014> something surprising for listeners. He sings, <U+201C>I got the pressure that<U+2019>s pushing my buttons and making me think about death,<U+201D> in <U+201C>Wiped Out!<U+201D> and <U+201C>I<U+2019>m sick and I<U+2019>m tired too<U+2026>/ I hope I don<U+2019>t murder me / I hope I don<U+2019>t burden you<U+201D> in <U+201C>The Beach.<U+201D> Although Rutherford<U+2019>s lyrics feel earnest, they<U+2019>re harsh for the more casual listener. But the album then dips into the band<U+2019>s more familiar side with songs like: <U+201C>Daddy Issues,<U+201D> a velvety ode to Rutherford<U+2019>s deceased father; <U+201C>Greetings from Califournia,<U+201D> a haunting and bass-heavy piece not unlike <U+201C>Let it Go<U+201D> off their 2012 EP <U+201C>Thank You<U+201D>; and closing track <U+201C>R.I.P. 2 My Youth,<U+201D> the sinister hit about the band<U+2019>s death of innocence. These songs rekindle the classic, melodious sounds of The Neighbourhood, as does <U+201C>Baby Came Home 2 / Valentines,<U+201D> the standout sequel to <U+201C>Baby Came Home<U+201D> off their breakout EP <U+201C>I<U+2019>m Sorry<U+2026>.<U+201D> <U+201C>She was five foot four with some money on the floor in a box that<U+2019>s hidden under her bed / I was only twenty-two with a pocket full of truth but I gave her everything that I had,<U+201D> Rutherford writes. The combination of mysterious lines and aching guitar chords give the sequel the sensuality and pain of the very relationship it<U+2019>s written about.Overall, the album adds a new flavor of distress. But the incorporation of the band<U+2019>s styles isn<U+2019>t as strong as it was on their last album <U+201C>I Love You,<U+201D> and neither are the lyrics. While some painful lines require a less casual listener to be enjoyed, the album<U+2019>s seamless tone outweighs complaints. The sounds are heavy, moody, intoxicating and catchy; The Neighbourhood is still as captivating as ever. <U+201C>Wiped Out!<U+201D> evokes the feeling of being young, emotional and reckless underneath California<U+2019>s palm trees <U+2014> even for those who have never visited the state.Runners-up<U+201C>Transforming The Black Narrative One Exhibition At a Time<U+201D>Labiba Chowdhury, age 18Fairy tales and myths allow us to escape the stress of our realities and enter magical worlds where anything is possible. Unfortunately, these stories are dominantly a white narrative with a disappointing absence of people-of-color characters. Although these stories are meant to allow one to escape into magical worlds, as a person of color, these worlds seem to be out of reach. Occasionally there will be one <U+201C>token black person<U+201D> that you will hold onto like a key into a world with an uncomfortable lack of color. But even then, you are rarely in the center. <U+201C>Unveiling Visions: The Alchemy of the Black Imagination,<U+201D> an art exhibit in the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in Harlem, opens the door into a world where stories of the past, present, and future, not only include black people, but place them in the center.   <U+201C>Unveiling Visions<U+201D> begins with artwork showcasing futuristic depictions of black characters. The oil paintings and digital media create a unique aesthetic that combines futuristic metallic wear with tribal print. It is not a common sight in media to see a strong black woman in a red dress decorated with metallic embroidery as in <U+201C>Do Androids Dream of How People Sleep?<U+201D> by Krista Franklin, for example. The exhibit included artwork that created a mystical world of strong black characters with magical powers. Images of black mermaids, warriors and sorcerers decorated the walls. <U+201C>Cosmic Traveller<U+201D> by Julie Dillon is one such piece that stood out to me. The mix of reds and blues with a serene sorceress in the center, leaves me feeling that I would probably feel safe in a universe with a heroine like her protecting me. The exhibition did not leave out our present story of racial strife, however. One of my favorite pieces was a movie poster <U+201C>Attack of the 14 year old Black Girl.<U+201D> <U+201C>Unveiling Visions<U+201D> is an exhibition that anyone who wants to gaze into a window of a more colorful human story, must go to see. <U+201C><U+2018>Gone<U+2019> Series a Riveting Page Turner<U+201D>Anna Cox, age 17It sounded like a corny dystopian novel: kids with superpowers! No adults! <U+201C>The Hunger Games<U+201D> with super speed and telekinesis! My inclination toward reading <U+201C>Gone<U+201D> by Michael Grant was minimal at first, but within a week, I had bought and finished all six books in the addicting series. The <U+201C>Gone<U+201D> series is not a cheap work of science fiction or a <U+201C>Hunger Games<U+201D> knockoff; instead, it<U+2019>s a frightening, gripping tale of chaos and control with a terrifying picture that everyone in the novel is under fifteen years old. Though some parts are marked by clich<U+00E9>s, the series is impossible to put down and brings the reader on a wild, chaotic trip. The series centers on Perdido Beach, California, a small beach town that appears to have two significant landmarks: Coates, a private school for rich, troubled kids and a nuclear power plant. And one day, a third appears: a dome that encircles the town. At the same time, everyone aged fifteen and older simply vanishes into thin air. The kids are left to fend for themselves in the town, nicknamed the <U+201C>FAYZ,<U+201D> with no answers as to why it has happened. As some children develop supernatural powers like healing and super strength, factions form among them. They must learn to survive without food and eventually electricity. Though never unnecessarily gory, Grant is unafraid to describe the mental and physical tortures the kids experience, oft inflicted by one another. Each novel presents a new curse upon the town. The situations are terrifying and none take pity on the age of the residents, making the books difficult at times to read, but still riveting with well-written action scenes and climaxes. Although sometimes written predictably, no character is one-dimensional. The hero Sam Temple struggles with his power and rejects his authority; the healer Lana Lazar<U+2019>s mental tortures and her actions from them make her both a sympathized and hated character. Despicable Drake Merwin is not just a figurehead because the novel needs a villain; he is pure evil and malice, ranking up there with Hannibal Lecter. His psychotic actions strike fear into every scene. While the end result of many battles and the series in some ways predictable, what makes the tales so gripping is that the means to get there are not. Every page is filled with surprises <U+2014> no character is safe from death, injury, or mental torture. Clich<U+00E9> relationships are easily forgiven for its page-turning chaos. It<U+2019>s easy to find yourself rooting for every character, even if their interests conflict with each other. You want to see these poor kids win. You want to see them stay alive. For a thrilling read, pick up <U+201C>Gone<U+201D>: you won<U+2019>t regret it. <U+201C>Blindness: A Blindfolded Expedition<U+201D>Joaquin, age 17Isn<U+2019>t it astonishing how words on a page can completely confuse you, completely disgust you and completely move you? Jos<U+00E9> Saramago has written a grotesque, dystopian, inspiring mental picture book that will forever leave an imprint on the eyes of my mind. The <U+201C>white blindness<U+201D> (an epidemic of chronic blindness) that slowly consumes the population mirrors the effect this writing has had on my thoughts.It is impossible to discuss this book without discussing the structure. Admittedly, I found myself confused within the first chapters ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
f the book: tripping and falling on run-on sentences, dissecting dialogue like archaeologists examine hieroglyphics. It is paramount to learn quickly that Saramago<U+2019>s writing is highly liberal. Without quotation marks, dialogue is distinguished only by capitalization, making following difficult in some cases. Although obstructive, this technique contributes to the <U+201C>blind<U+201D> style of writing. I further noticed that the chapters increased in length gradually to the end. Even though the last few chapters seemed like the giant brothers of the frequent run-on sentences, I understood their size; it represents the loss of panic and fretfulness of the blind.Jos<U+00E9> Saramago<U+2019>s innate hatred for censorship from his history rears its horrific and terrific head in <U+201C>Blindness.<U+201D> His previous novel was prevented from contesting the European Literary Prize for censorship for the sensibilities of the Roman Catholic Church. Against this and the dictatorship in Portugal at the time, Saramago moved. This book will test your gut literally. Frequent images of vomiting, defecation, sex and gore make the story almost uncomfortably realistic. While I admire Saramago<U+2019>s dedication to the uncensored reality, it may be uncomfortable for some readers.<U+201C>1984<U+201D> opened the eyes of a generation to the world of government infringement on our privacy, and <U+201C>Blindness<U+201D> now closes the eyes of a generation to simulate a slow dissipation of privacy. Saramago achieves this without a single name. Admittedly, it is somewhat frustrating to repeat the titles such as <U+201C>the doctor<U+2019>s wife,<U+201D> deemed to characters when discussing the book; these show Saramago<U+2019>s almost ridiculous dedication to this concept. In fact, the dialogue of the characters must deliberately avoid name-calling at one point, ever so cautiously breaking the fourth wall. Saramago<U+2019>s devotion to this concept is something I truly appreciate. His deliberate exclusion of the names of the people and <U+201C>the Government<U+201D> stress the point that this epidemic may happen anywhere, to anyone. By making the characters of the novel more impersonal, Saramago forces the reader to have an intimate connection with the story.Blindness<U+2019>s attention seeking structure, vulgar visions and personal impersonality require a binding commitment to the text. I was apprehensive, but now glad I took the hand into the milky white unknown of this novel, and I recommend you do the same.<U+201C>Jurassic World<U+201D>Kathryn Lori, age 17In this engrossing science fiction thriller, Simon Masrani (Irfan Khan) continues the legacy of Jurassic Park by founding a corresponding theme park, Jurassic World, on the original site. Through the use of the most current genetics research, Simon<U+2019>s scientists are able to create artificially produced dinosaurs that are more hardy and powerful than those of prehistoric times. This film, as led by the protagonist raptor trainer Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) fully immerses the viewer into the futuristic and perilous island that is Jurassic World.The filmmakers intrigue the audience through the use of vibrant visuals and realistic portrayals of the dinosaurs rather than employing excessive gore. This allows the film to draw attention to the modern aesthetics as opposed to making the film overtly frightening. The brilliant graphics also allow the movie to expand its audience to younger viewers in addition to just adults. The decision to avoid blatant carnage merits a PG-13 rating, by keeping the movie approachable for kids.Even during the most intense dinosaur rampages, <U+201C>Jurassic World<U+201D> incorporates a comedic undertone to the film. A man with his priorities in order, played by none other than Jimmy Buffett, takes the time to grab his two margaritas before fleeing from a massive swarm of pterodactyls. This absurd reaction to a dinosaur attack is a brilliant way to charm the viewer during a time of turmoil. The movie also uses well placed irony to lighten the mood, such as when Lowery (Jake Johnson) exclaims that he bought a Jurassic Park shirt off eBay, because <U+201C>the old school Jurassic Park merch was legit!<U+201D> This reference to the prior <U+201C>Jurassic Park<U+201D> movies undoubtedly serves to excite long-term fans of the franchise. As a means of bringing more substance into the movie<U+2019>s trite plot, <U+201C>Jurassic World<U+201D> delves into ethical issues with respect to animal rights. Park operations manager Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard) originally fails to fathom that the dinosaurs are living beings that are worthy of sympathy. This ignorance causes dinosaurs to be unjustly confined in captivity, which is damaging to the animals<U+2019> developments and translates into aggression. The mosasaur is kept in the solitude of captivity and mauls a woman near its tank, which draws a parallel to the way that orca whales slaughter SeaWorld trainers in the documentary <U+201C>Blackfish.<U+201D> This allusion to SeaWorld makes the viewers contemplate the morality of animal captivity in a more tangible real-life scenario than the futuristic setting of the film. Overall, <U+201C>Jurassic World<U+201D> is an amusing film that successfully engages the target audience in a thought provoking way. The vivid graphics, comedic undertones, and inlay of ethical perspectives cause the film to be a compelling simulation of the commercialization of dinosaurs.<U+201C>Black and Brown Stories Matter: <U+2018>Show and Prove<U+2019> by Sofia Quintero<U+201D>Kirin Mueller, age 13<U+201C>Hip-hop was created by black and brown kids, in the Bronx, in the street,<U+201D> said author Sofia Quintero at a recent reading of Latino/a YA authors at the East Harlem La Casa Azul Bookstore. She was reading from her recently published YA novel, <U+201C>Show and Prove<U+201D> (Alfred A. Knopf, 2015), alongside authors Daniel Jos<U+00E9> Older and Danette Vigilante. <U+201C>Hip-hop is poetry, storytelling, dance, and visual art,<U+201D> she added.<U+201C>Without hip-hop, I would not have a voice,<U+201D> agreed Older. <U+201C>Show and Prove<U+201D> is a novel set in the Bronx of the early 1980s, told from the alternating points of view of teenagers Raymond <U+201C>Smiles<U+201D> King and Guillermo <U+201C>Nike<U+201D> Vega. Quintero dedicates the book <U+201C>for all the young people everywhere creating something from nothing,<U+201D> and that is what Smiles and Nike do. Despite facing gang threats, a new crush on sassy and sincere Sara, and a break dancing competition at the Roxy, Nike finds his voice and contributes to an artistic revolution: the birth of hip-hop, rapping, and break dancing. Both he and Smiles face the raw brutality of street life in the South Bronx, where shootings, muggings, drug deals, and even killings are a regular part of the atmosphere. Long before hip-hop became an international phenomenon, the music and dance was a way for teenagers to tell their stories and tell the world, and even themselves, <U+201C>we are here.<U+201D>Even though this book is set decades before the #BlackLivesMatter movement, it reminds teenage readers of today that issues such as racial profiling, oppression, and injustice have a long history in this country. <U+201C>Show and Prove<U+201D> also reminds young adult readers that black and brown kids were the ones who created the multibillion dollar industry of hip-hop, but more important, that we are creators, and that our stories do have a place in literature.<U+201C>Young people inspire me and give me the stories I want to tell,<U+201D> said Quintero at the reading. As a teenage reader myself, I hope Quintero and other authors like her keep telling stories of kids who are like me, and not like me. Black and brown lives matter, black and brown stories matter. <U+201C>Black Mass Review<U+201D>Gregory Nemesdy, age 17You know that dirt you get underneath your fingernails after a hard day<U+2019>s work? You understand what I mean, outside, digging in the ground, sweat dripping from your forehead, blisters forming on the pads of your fingers, a little bit of blood on your knuckles after beating the life out of some poor man who couldn<U+2019>t keep his mouth shut. Yeah, that kind of dirt, the grit between your nails. That is the only way I can describe to you the feeling <U+201C>Black Mass<U+201D> instills into you. This gritty, no, DIRTY crime drama will have you in awe of the real darkness that lies in the human mind. This is the type of film you smoke cigars to, drinking scotch with some old buddies of yours in a dark, very dark, room.Based off the true story of Whitey Bulger, it follows the lives of those highest ranked in the Irish Mob during the 70s and 80s in Boston, and how the FBI was tricked into expanding the empire ruled by a psychopath. Johnny Depp<U+2019>s portrayal of this Irish gangster (Whitey Bulger) is not only amazing, but notably disturbing how well he makes us believe this person to be a true monster, while still making us root for him. He really makes the character a true personification of disillusion and insanity. Joel Edgerton, playing John Connolly, expertly portrays this character as a fast talking FBI agent who can sell an idea to anyone within minutes, including the heads of his department. Affectively turning into an alliance, the Irish Mob and FBI work together to shut down rival gangs, expanding the power of Whitey Bulger. With a strong ensemble cast, including Benedict Cumberbatch, Jesse Plemons, and Rory Cochrane, alongside others, bring this movie to another level of awesome, gritty acting. The film<U+2019>s only negative part was the lack of screen time devoted to some of the other characters, such as Kevin Bacon<U+2019>s portrayal in the FBI, and Jesse Plemons performance as Kevin Weeks, a longtime friend and confidant of Bulger. The stories of these opposites should most definitely have been expanded, especially since the talent was definitely there in the screen time they did have.By the time the movie ends, you<U+2019>ll be turning to your friends and seriously debating whether to start a gang with them or not. This drama will fill you with excitement and pure intrigue as to how people can descend into such a level of immorality and even the belief of immortality. How could one get away with so much for so long? Kind of makes you want to try it for yourself.<U+201C>I Am Malala<U+201D>Max Oppenheimer, age 13Can one teenage girl be a world influencer? Davis Guggenheim<U+2019>s documentary <U+201C>He Named Me Malala<U+201D> sets out to answer this. In a portrait of the Nobel Peace Prize winning activist Malala Yousafzai, we see a young woman full of ambition and poise yet still searching for her own personal identity. Malala is a strong advocate for girls and women<U+2019>s rights in her native Pakistan, particularly in education. Her outspokenness, first in a BBC blog, led to wide support but also violent opposition including a near assassination by the Taliban. She has since become a world renowned figure, idolized by many for her brave work, selfless dedication and eloquence.Amid such acclaim, however, Malala is still only a human teenager. Everyone has their imperfections, their conflicts and issues, even those that are most lauded in this world. The documentary excels most when it explores the more personal side. Malala is not perfect. Much like others her age, she is sometimes prone to a failing test grade in school, fights with her siblings on occasion and has typical adolescent concerns and interests. The revealing scenes of her <U+201C>off stage<U+201D> as a regular girl is what really makes this documentary special. We get a chance to know her not just as a superhero but as a genuine young person.In its structure and look, <U+201C>He Named Me Malala<U+201D> has a very jarring feel. Scenes jump back and forth between grainy footage exposing the violent acts of the Taliban to Malala bonding with her family and enjoying times at home. It works well to emulate the intense mix of both heartwarming and chaotic, dangerous events in Malala<U+2019>s life. The raw violence of those against her really adds a shot of shock for viewers. We see she is at once an ordinary teenage girl, with strong beliefs in equality and fairness. We also feel the chaos of living in a neighborhood where simply voicing ones ideas can make you dangerously targeted and even killed.The film employs a cohesive use of interviews, stories, and animation to present a multidimensional portrait of an extraordinary young woman. Malala is a hero on the world stage, a protester, a victim and a teenager. This film is not just a compelling portrait of a Nobel Peace Prize winner<U+2019>s public life and amazing works but also the story of a living young woman determining who she is in a very complex world. Viewers aren<U+2019>t simply witnesses of the events Malala faces, but also empathize in her emotions of pride, pain, fear and hope. Overall, <U+201C>He Named Me Malala<U+201D> is a beautiful, evocative work that stands on its own terms, with intense themes of identity, belief and the fate of humanity.<U+201C><U+2018>Deathstalker,<U+2019> a Space Opera to Outspace Them All<U+201D>Sydney Sackett, age 14<U+201C>Deathstalker<U+201D>: the first novel in a main series of eight, was written by Simon Green in 1995. Pages: more than five hundred, filled with nonstop action and every sci-fi feature under a galaxy of suns. Claim to fame: most of the elements that make it as good as it is are exactly the same elements critics use to lampoon it.Let<U+2019>s back up a bit.The story focuses on the adventures of Owen Deathstalker, head of his noble clan<U+2019>s estate and content as a historian in a legacy of warriors. When her Imperial Majesty Lionstone XIV declares him an outlaw of the Empire, his luxurious life blows into as many smithereens as there are plots seething around the throne, and he is forced into a bleak rebels<U+2019> world the scale of which he had never imagined. Alongside him, opposing, or walking parallel paths come a score of memorable characters, shooting lasers and shooting up with chemical boosts in a universe where <U+2018>safe<U+2019> is a half-step ahead of your enemies and <U+2018>hero<U+2019> can only depend on your own point of view.<U+201C>Deathstalker<U+201D> doesn<U+2019>t bring great innovation to the realm of fiction. It isn<U+2019>t a book to inspire deep pondering, and if you want a subtle exploration of morality, motivation and mystery to keep you second-guessing yourself for years later, you might do better to read a cookbook instead. That way, you can at least learn how to make a souffl<U+00E9> to snack on in your search for the meaning of life, if it has one. What <U+201C>Deathstalker<U+201D> brings to the table is dagger-sharp wit, spaceship crash after spaceship chase, genetically enhanced psychics, elves who aren<U+2019>t so much Santa<U+2019>s little helpers as oppressed subhuman freedom fighters, swarms of murderous aliens, and swarms of scheming noble clans just as murderous, but with better table manners and fashion to die for, if you<U+2019>re not stabbed in the back first.If you don<U+2019>t have a stomach for gore, other bodily fluids, and profanity pretty well justified by constant brutal battles, this is not the novel you are looking for. It<U+2019>s a mature young adult book for people who aren<U+2019>t averse to a spot of head explosion to go with their friendly neighborhood pill-popping, mascaraed fey psychopath. Step inside, though, and you<U+2019>ll be treated to the planet-hopping roller coaster debut of Owen<U+2019>s epic saga of rebellion. The drinks are plentiful, the stakes ever higher, and the parties are really to die for.<U+201C>Book Review: How <U+2018>All The Bright Places<U+2019> Changed My Life<U+201D>Chelsea Schroeder, age 18Most people avoid talking about the harsh realities of suicide. Like the way it can control a person, can make them feel like every breath they take is worthless and poignant; as if they have no purpose but to be sucked into a vortex of a never-ending <U+201C>black hole.<U+201D>Not being a victim of suicide myself, I would not have normally thought to pick up a YA novel such as <U+201C>All The Bright Places,<U+201D> but I am forever grateful that I did. It has changed my life.The story follows two high school seniors <U+2014> a popular, smart girl named Violet Markey <U+2014> and the school <U+201C>freak,<U+201D> Theodore Finch. Violet loves to write and is emotionally struggling with the recent death of her older sister, while Finch is fascinated with the concept of dying and has an undiagnosed bipolar disorder. It is no typical young love story, as the two meet for the first time atop the school<U+2019>s bell tower, the location where they contemplate jumping. The romance later ignites when the two are paired together for a school project, where they must <U+201C>wander<U+201D> many fascinating sites in their hometown Indiana before graduating and possibly leaving forever.Author Jennifer Niven shows no fear as she perfectly mirrors her own experiences and emotional struggles through fictional characters, captivating occurrences and a beautiful writing style. The story uniquely relays a truth that ultimately uncovers the eyes of many who dare to crack open the book of <U+201C>All The Bright Places.<U+201D>Before picking up the heart-wrenching page-turner, I never understood what it truly meant to be suicidal, and how much of a devastating effect a death by suicide can have on a lover, family and community. Niven managed to realistically communicate that unspoken complication all while shattering my heart into a thousand pieces, only to mend it again and again throughout the duration of the story. In the book, Violet creates a website, germmagazine.com, where she can express her thoughts about real world problems. The website exists today as a safe haven for any teen needing a place to turn, read and submit work.Niven made the quirky wanderings between the two characters an adventure. An adventure of love, overcoming loss, and even survival, in the ways that are not most often expected. Although the story can be a dark and sorrowful, it sends the powerful message that if one has the willpower to look between the lines, the cracks of their own darkness, they will not fail in finding all the bright places. <U+201C>May your eye go to the Sun, To the wind your soul<U+2026>You are all the colors in one, at full brightness.<U+201D> <U+2014> Jennifer Niven, <U+201C>All The Bright Places<U+201D>Honorable Mentions<U+201C>American History Gets a New Sound<U+201D>Alexis, age 17In a history teacher<U+2019>s finest dream, the origins of our country are a widespread phenomenon, where people young and old are enthralled by the story of our Founding Fathers. While some of the Founding Fathers remain on the back burner, our <U+201C>ten dollar Founding Father<U+201D> is receiving the praise and attention he deserves. Immortalizing our first Secretary of the Treasury in a Broadway musical, heavily influenced by hip-hop and rap culture, is a bizarre premise; most people would be unable to fathom the idea of rap battles between America<U+2019>s most prodigious figures, but Lin-Manuel Miranda manages to bring such a concept into fruition. Miranda is no stranger to creating hit Broadway shows, having won both a Grammy and a Tony for his musical <U+201C>In the Heights<U+201D> in 2008. His current show, <U+201C>Hamilton<U+201D> seems to be on the same track. As the hottest ticket on Broadway, the show is essentially booked for the rest of the year and the year to come, but <U+201C>Hamilton<U+201D> enthusiasts unable to attend the show<U+2019>s daily lottery are not totally out of luck. The story of <U+201C>Hamilton<U+201D> is entirely sung through, so the show<U+2019>s cast album is still able to provide entertainment in tandem with the delivery of a cohesive, engaging story line, despite the absence of visual aids. The story, based off Rob Chernow<U+2019>s biography on Alexander Hamilton, illustrates the rise of the orphaned immigrant who would quickly become a key component in the creation of our country. Listening to the album in chronological order creates the optimal listening experience, as many of the songs transition smoothly into the next. The beginning of the show<U+2019>s cast album can be off-putting for those expecting a more traditional style of show tune. However, once listeners are able to adapt to the modern style of music, they will be able to appreciate more fully the clever integration of <U+201C>ancient history<U+201D> into a more mainstream sound. The show is known for its inspired rhymes and heavy hip-hop influence, but also borrows and utilizes elements from other styles of music to create an album that would satisfy listeners from all walks of musical life. Whether a listener is in the mood for a peppy ballad sung by King George III, or a sorrowful lament from Hamilton<U+2019>s spouse, the album demonstrates that music, by itself, can have an equal impact on its broad audience and create an immersive environment as influential as seeing the show on stage. Currently available on music streaming apps like Pandora and Spotify, <U+201C>Hamilton<U+201D> is well worth the listen by musical enthusiasts and the average American alike. <U+201C><U+2018>Spectre<U+2019> Leaves the Audience Shaken, not Stirred<U+201D>E. M. Brenner, age 16The Bond films have always been renowned for their mix of undeniable class, action and romance. The immortalized epics of 007 are a cultural staple that have kept audiences entertained since Dr. No was released back in 1962, and clearly by the incredible box office results, <U+201C>Spectre<U+201D> continues the Bond legacy of entertaining the world.  However, for people who value the original Bond films for their signature sly ambience, <U+201C>Spectre<U+201D> was nothing more than another popular action flick. Class and style were drowned out by the endless montage of CGI effects and unnecessary fight scenes, as Bond lost all his authentic charisma to the stereotypical emotionless action movie protagonist that Daniel Craig portrays. Just when you expect to watch a thought-provoking intellectual scene that the Sean Connery Bond films would have provided, another superfluous car-chase or gunfight is forced upon an unwilling audience. <U+201C>Spectre<U+201D> lost the elements that defined the original Bond films as intriguing, and kept the one element of Bond films that should have been left back in the 1960s: Bond<U+2019>s womanizing mannerisms.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 In the short 148 minute period, Bond falls for, takes advantage of, and abuses three different women, all of whom are given marginal supporting roles at most. Living in the 21st century and portraying the hero of a popular film as a monster toward his female counterparts only reinforces the notion that men can act however they please toward females. When the audience has to listen closely to learn the names of the women Bond is constantly forcing into submission, then the once petty tales of meaningless romance have gone too far. For anyone who values the impact of women in society, Bond has transformed into a villain as opposed to the beloved hero he once was. When the decision was made to turn <U+201C>Spectre<U+201D> into an action flick instead of a reinvention of an old classic, expired traits like Bond<U+2019>s philanderous ways should have been left to rot in the junkyard with the rest of the vintage.  <U+201C>Spectre<U+201D> was a mediocre movie at best. For those looking to watch a hodgepodge of CGI effects and gory fight scenes, it may hold exactly what you are looking for. But for the Bond fans with a love for the class and style that the original films had, you would be better off watching an older favorite than wasting your time on the blockbuster catastrophe that Sam Mendes brought to life. <U+201C>Spectre<U+201D> discarded all the endearing elements of 007, and kept the pieces that we all wish had been left behind.<U+201C>Review: <U+2018>Annie and Friends,<U+2019> A Modern Twist on a Timeless Classic<U+201D>C@tie, age 16Are elementary aged students capable of pulling off the timeless classic <U+201C>Annie<U+201D> with many modern updates to the story? One most notably being the title, <U+201C>Annie and Friends<U+201D>; the children of Hawes Elementary School in Ridgewood, New Jersey had under eight weeks to pull off this task with the pressure of it being their school<U+2019>s 50th Anniversary. While much of the story line remained the same, the biggest change was the absence of Daddy Warbucks, replaced by a similar character, Mr. Stacks. In the original <U+201C>Annie,<U+201D> Daddy Warbucks was just a wealthy businessman, well established in his career. Mr. Stacks, played by Ethan Holden, is a younger man with new found money, running for mayor in New York City. Wardrobed in a suit, this child superstar, took his role seriously and made his character believable. In keeping with the balance of old and new, <U+201C>Annie and Friends,<U+201D> included the most famous songs from the original, <U+201C>Hard Knock Life<U+201D> and <U+201C>Tomorrow,<U+201D> but included 2014<U+2019>s song of the year, <U+201C>Uptown Funk,<U+201D> by Bruno Mars. The integration was seamless and added a spunky, energetic element to fully entertain the audience. Also, amusing the audience was the main character Annie, played by Anna Williams. Despite her age this young actress was a dynamo on stage. Songs, monologues and choreography were to perfection. In her most challenging scene, Mr. Stacks saves her from the moving taxi. Brought to life with a well constructed, yellow cardboard taxi being <U+201C>driven<U+201D> enhanced with bona fide sound effects. Williams and Holden created a believable scene in which Annie and Mr. Stacks meet for the first time. Even though this modernized meeting is drastically different from the original the relationship between the pair unfolds in the same way. The idea of Annie staying with Mr. Stacks is orchestrated by his team Donald (Mikey Kaufman) and Grace (Jenna Lincoln) to improve his public image before his election. Annie and Mr. Stacks spend time together experiencing the Big Apple in new ways. Intertwining another theatrical classic, <U+201C>Newsies,<U+201D> <U+201C>Annie and Friends<U+201D> displays downtown New York as a technology filled city, where people are spreading news through social media. When the Newsies are discussing Mr. Stacks election, Joe (Matthew Carver), encourages his fellow Newsies to spread the word on social sites such as Facebook. It wasn<U+2019>t just the Newsies; Miss Hannigan (Alexis Rosenfeld) mentions social media like Twitter and Snapchat throughout the play, proving that <U+201C>Annie and Friends<U+201D> is a modern update to the classic. <U+201C>Of Miniature Houses and Broken Radios<U+201D>Ella DeMerritt, age 14Marie-Laure LeBlanc is six years old, blind, motherless, and lives alone with her father in Paris. He makes her a miniature model of her neighborhood so she can find her way around. But when she takes a museum trip and learns of the Sea of Flames, a speculated <U+201C>magical jewel,<U+201D> Marie-Laure gets wrapped up in a conspiracy plot like you would never imagine. Seven year old Werner Pfennig lives in a German orphanage outside of Essen with his younger sister, Jutta. He has a knack for fixing and creating things, starting with a basic radio that he and his sister find. But when the Nazis find out about his uncanny ability with most things technological, he<U+2019>s whisked off into a nightmare of a world. In <U+201C>All The Light We Cannot See,<U+201D> Anthony Doerr marvelously illustrates wartime Germany and two isolated children trying to survive the brutal treatment of the German conquest in his book. Marie-Laure, trying to live through the bombings of Paris and Saint-Malo, and Werner, avoiding slaughter by the German military<U+2019>s hand in the Young Hitler academy he attends. The time that the two children live in is brutal and relentless. And Doerr shows it too, with his advanced knowledge of World War II (this guy did his research) and his constantly expanding plot to communicate the feelings of the children and their perception on events.This book is both a prime example of the classic plot, <U+201C>two children navigate adolescence in their two very different worlds,<U+201D> but with a twist. Instead of meeting and falling in love and living their lives together (oh how clich<U+00E9>) they meet for a mere day, passing by each other and saving each other<U+2019>s lives during the German attack on Saint-Malo. This leaves plenty of time, and I cannot emphasize this enough, for Doerr to create their own story lines and develop the characters.Doerr sheds light on the brutality of the Nazi soldiers in France and Germany, and he does it with balance, giving equal time to both of the main characters, which is appreciated, as both characters get an ample amount of development. As the reader, I found that this helped me to get two perspectives to one story, and gave me more knowledge of the time they were living in than a single perspective book.In the end, my opinion on this book was overwhelmingly positive. Everything about it sucked me in and made me want to keep reading, and even when I was done, I knew there was still a deeper meaning to all of the symbolism. Anthony Doerr<U+2019>s novel was truly a pleasure to read, enjoy and critique. <U+201C>A Night with Mozart and the New York Philharmonic<U+201D>Graham Deubner, age 18My last trip to the New York Philharmonic at the newly dubbed David Geffen Hall was truly a night to remember. I had my misgivings about the <U+201C>All-Mozart Program,<U+201D> for I have seen similar programs of all one composer which turned out to be too much of the same and lacking originality, but I can say that I was happily surprised. The program was designed artfully, providing a variety of works performed by different arrangements of musicians, all while staying within the cumbersome boundaries of a single composer.  The opening piece was a short, charming three movement a divertimento in D major. It had an obviously Mozartian flare, with lively melodies that reappear throughout the piece in fantastic ways. The piece itself, while quite enjoyable, was nothing as grand as his symphonies, but it was conveyed with elegance by the Philharmonic players making it just as enjoyable. I was in awe at how utterly precise and together the group was throughout the entire piece. With the reduced orchestration (closer to how this piece would have been performed in Mozart<U+2019>s day) one could clearly see the communication between the five string sections, as they artfully passed melodic lines back and forth, weaving a simple yet elegant web of music, which the audience, myself included, received warmly.The next piece on the program was my main reason for attendance, Mozart<U+2019>s Horn Concerto Number 2 in E-flat major, featuring the Philharmonics own principal horn, Philip Myers. This piece, also easily recognizable as a work of Mozart, is really quite silly. It asks for all sorts of runs and jumps and other such acrobatics on an instrument which is really quite cumbersome. Nonetheless, Myers performed it beautifully, giving an almost flawless performance. But even the apparent ease with which he played was not the highlight of this piece. It was his beautiful, rich, butter-like tone that stole the show. It<U+2019>s a sound unlike any other and what makes him one of the best horn players in the world, and my personal favorite.  The final piece, which followed a short intermission, was Mozart<U+2019>s Serenade Number 10 in B-flat major, the Gran Partita. This piece, performed by an arrangement of only winds and a bass, provided a very nice contrast to the previous pieces, which were dominated by strings. While this piece too was artfully preformed and has many beautiful melodies, it is not one of my favorites, due to its incredibly repetitive nature and length. Had Maestro Gilbert decided to cut out a few repeats, I would have been quite content. Even so, it was a pleasant ending to and excellent concert leaves me eagerly awaiting my next visit.  <U+201C>Gordo: Pure Gold<U+201D>Jed Dewey, age 16At 77, he does it because he loves it. As that Carefree Highway begins to slip away, his love for music and entertaining is clearer than ever and was revealed in abundance last Saturday night at the State Theater in Ithaca, NY. Through stories, humor, love and music, the magic that is Gordon Lightfoot was on display for every 60s <U+2014> 70s folk music aficionado and budding young fan of timeless gold in the audience. The Canadian singer-songwriter has been on a tour across America, hitting venues in spurts of twelve as he and his aging comrades strategically pace their 60-show tour. Performances ranged from classic ballads like the epic <U+201C>The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald<U+201D> and <U+201C>If You Could Read my Mind<U+201D> to his more upbeat, lighthearted soul-searchers including <U+201C>Rainy Day People<U+201D> and <U+201C>Carefree Highway.<U+201D> Lightfoot sang alongside his original band members in front of a slew of bright lights and against a backdrop of whimsical, image-reflecting, treelike structures, all of which were vivid enough to catch the eye, while never distracting the audience<U+2019>s attention from the main show. The instrumentals for every song were perfect and haunting, bringing vinyl memories alive in the hearts and minds of the troubadour<U+2019>s fans. Gordo himself was truly remarkable. Just three days shy of his 77th birthday, the 52-year folk music veteran who has survived alcoholism, multiple serious illnesses, and a tracheotomy that would have ended a lesser individual<U+2019>s career, Gord<U+2019>s light blazed. Fans expecting a man in his prime were, surely, disappointed. Those hoping to see a legend <U+2014> perhaps for the first time or, maybe, one last time <U+2014> were blessed with a night to remember. The concert, from start to finish, was stunning <U+2014> not because of the singing, but for the nostalgia enveloping it. Though his voice was frail at times, Lightfoot was unwaveringly happy, enthusiastic, self-deprecating, and friendly with the crowd throughout his two-hour performance. When he needed it most, Lightfoot was able to conjure-up his silky-smooth signature voice. After his heartfelt tribute to the families of the Edmund Fitzgerald<U+2019>s sailors, audience members only needed to close their eyes and listen to the man take us back to 1976. Every true Gordo fan was absolutely thrilled just to be there, listening to great music sung by a man who has defied odds. Those who walked out at intermission, or even after the first song, missed a beautiful show of life. If you went home, dusted off your records, and listened to what you wanted to hear, it paled in comparison to what the rest of us felt in our hearts: Gord<U+2019>s Gold.<U+201C><U+2018>Madam Secretary': Impacts of Female Leadership<U+201D>Mary Margaret Evanek, age 16An average day for professor Elizabeth McCord in Charlottesville, Virginia, consisted of mucking stalls at the horse ranch she owned with her fellow-professor husband and juggling life with three children. That was until her ordinary life took a turn when the President of the United States personally came to her ranch home to recruit McCord for the newly vacated position of Secretary of State. Thus the name for ABC<U+2019>s hit TV series, <U+201C>Madam Secretary.<U+201D> Madam Secretary<U+2019>s President Dalton says to McCord, <U+201C>You quit a position you love for ethical reasons, that makes you the least political person I know.<U+201D> In McCord<U+2019>s role, she finds her work as a former CIA analyst put to great use. Her ability to <U+201C>read people<U+201D> serves her well as she navigates her new role and makes high-impact decisions at the height of international conflicts. Elizabeth McCord is said to be an idealized version of Hillary Clinton. McCord<U+2019>s role as Madam Secretary is certainly a reminder of women<U+2019>s progress in and out of the political world throughout history. Madam Secretary represents many female leaders today. She does not necessarily represent all women but she does, however, represent the common women as shown in the pilot episode of the TV series where she is seen mucking out horse stalls on her family<U+2019>s horse ranch. Furthermore, most women who end up in powerful positions are survivors who have likely overcome a lot more obstacles on their way up than their male counterparts. Still to this day, women in power do not always have the same financial income as their male co-workers. Madam Secretary<U+2019>s problem-solving communication allows her to collaborate and connect with people on a more personal level. She is in a position of power where she can and does effectively influence and change others. Some might say, she exerts her power by communicating <U+201C>like a woman<U+201D>; meaning that many female leaders in power encourage more participation, are more receptive to ideas, are generally more encouraging, empathetic, concerned, caring, less direct and less likely to exert power than their male counterparts. Henry McCord, Elizabeth<U+2019>s husband, is also from the intelligence world and is also a religion scholar and professor at Georgetown University. He always supports her whether it be at home or taking on domestic responsibilities pertaining to his former (and ongoing) life as an NSA spy. Even though they are living under not so ordinary circumstances, the McCord family is presented with real life problems and typical family dynamics, making the series relatable and intriguing. I am personally drawn to the ongoing parallels of current event issues, the breakdown of roles in American intelligence when handling the situations, and the strength of strong female leadership. <U+201C>David Guggenhiem<U+2019>s <U+2018>He Named Me Malala<U+2019> Doesn<U+2019>t Do Justice to Its Subject<U+201D>Mateo Guynn, age 13Strong. Moving. Inspirational. That<U+2019>s what Malala is <U+2014> and what Davis Guggenheim<U+2019>s documentary <U+201C>He Named Me Malala<U+201D> could have been. But due to poor directing and editing, it falls significantly short and ends up feeling like an overworked hagiography. Despite a worthy message, the sheer amount of lost potential will leave many viewers unsatisfied.The story follows Malala, a girl growing up in the increasingly Taliban-controlled Pakistan. It<U+2019>s a tale about the odd sheep that spoke out against injustice <U+2014> and an interesting one at that. Unfortunately, Guggenheim<U+2019>s use of a jumpy chronological order to help emphasize his message has the unintended side effect of making Malala lose all emotional depth. If things progressed in a natural order, viewers would be cheering and weeping <U+2014> but instead, all is revealed in the first quarter of the movie, and the rest seems like filler with a few important morsels woven throughout. Even one of the most emotional parts <U+2014> the portion depicting Malala getting shot <U+2014> is ruined by a monotonous recalling. Anyone who wants a powerful, emotional tear-jerker of a documentary should stay far away from this one.Luckily, Malala has a partially redeeming message. On the surface it seems to be a documentary about women<U+2019>s rights, but dig deeper and one realizes that women<U+2019>s rights are only emphasized. Guggenheim exceeds at his true purpose of showing the importance of education <U+2014> what Malala calls <U+201C>our most powerful weapon.<U+201D> Throughout the movie, Guggenheim links declining knowledge to increasing unhappiness (if one can decipher his timeline). At first, Pakistan is portrayed as peaceful and content. Then people start listening to broadcasts propagated by the Taliban, who gain enough influence to start telling women not to go to school, and then to burn media. One thing leads to another, and soon the Taliban are destroying schools. As Pakistanis are deprived of more and more knowledge, they lose more and more power until the Taliban has complete control over the country. It<U+2019>s a strong insight into society, with a clear message reining supreme: those with education are powerful, and those without are not. Not only does it show what happens to people without education, it juxtaposes them to people who do. One moment the movie depicts English schoolchildren, leading happy, full lives. The next, it shows Africans in poverty, some with living conditions so bad they<U+2019>re trying to escape their country. What<U+2019>s the link? English children have education. Africans don<U+2019>t.With so much potential, <U+201C>He Named Me Malala<U+201D> could have been an astounding documentary. And it is <U+2014> if you<U+2019>re looking for something to ponder and analyze. Unfortunately, its timeline, story and directing make it a poor choice for those looking for an engaging, emotional tale.<U+201C><U+2018>Hawken': Another Installment in the Free-to-Play Saga<U+201D>Lucas Hanson, age 17<U+201C>Hawken,<U+201D> a Reloaded Games 2013 release, brings nothing new to the table in a gaming industry that crams a new <U+201C>Call of Duty<U+201D>/<U+201D>Halo<U+201D>/<U+201D>Fallout<U+201D> down our throats every year. Yet again players are welcomed to war torn futuristic cities, artillery bombarded Martian landscapes and other regurgitated battlefields to engage in combat with their online foes. And yet again we see that players are offered this entertainment experience for free. Until you finish your first match of multiplayer.I loaded up the game, suited up in my 20 foot tall <U+201C>robot suit<U+201D> or <U+201C>mech,<U+2019> and <U+201C>launched<U+201D> into the battle, immediately searching for an enemy to blow up with my rocket launcher. After wandering the dilapidated urban landscape for a few minutes I stumbled upon a worthy foe, only to be dealt my first death quickly and efficiently, by an adversary who seemed far more well equipped than I. The game went on like this for a few more minutes until my team<U+2019>s defeat.After all the post game meshugas, I was then deposited at a waiting screen, with a countdown of 40 seconds signaling the start of the next match. Alongside this countdown, was a menu where it appeared I could upgrade my mech suit, perhaps to increase my chances of success in the next match. But next to each new weapon or mech suit was a price. Three words: pay to win. Like a shiny silver briefcase out of an action movie, the game was only really exciting, or at all interesting, when you put money into it.Don<U+2019>t get me wrong; I felt <U+201C>Hawken<U+201D> was well made. The controls felt smooth, the piloting mechanics realistic.  The combat, despite my general ineptitude at it, was also fun. It was satisfying to sidestep an enemy rocket at the last second, before delivering a blow of your own to your now defenseless enemies. Menus were crisp, the sound was engaging, and playing the game was an enjoyable experience. But all this good proved to be over matched by the fact that in the competitive sense of the game, he with the deeper pockets would be more proficient.  The reality is that anyone in the world can download and play <U+201C>Hawken,<U+201D> but to really enjoy it, for it to be really worth your time, you must supplement your free download with in game purchases. It serves as a prime example of the business model that so many game developers have adopted, one that more often than not gives us quality games, but forces us to sink an undefined amount of money into them to make them fun.<U+201C><U+2018>Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt': A Na<U+00EF>ve Fish Out of Water<U+201D>Emily Holmquist, age 16 If you are a lover and viewer of Netflix, <U+201C>Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt<U+201D> (a Netflix original) is a hilarious and bizarre TV show that will have you laughing and questioning the entire concept of the show at the same time. We are first shown a confused Kimmy being removed from an underground bunker: the home of a post apocalyptic cult. Earlier in her life she and four other women had been abducted and convinced the Earth had been scorched but after being found she soon discovered that to be false. The TV show may appear inferior to Network or Cable shows since it is Netflix produced; however, the cinematography and writing is fun and exceptional. Ellie Kemper, who portrays the na<U+00EF>ve yet resilient Kimberly Schmidt, is fabulous and enticing; she truly depicts in her acting the sensitive and goofy yet hardworking girl who wants to experience things in the world that she has been deprived of, and take a bite out of the Big Apple. Within the first two episodes you are introduced to the various aspects of extremely dynamic characters. They are shown in diverse settings and situations which convey more about their personalities and the comic relief or thought they bring to the show. As the season progresses, you are introduced to even more characters which in an exciting way all fit together and add to the flow of the episodes, almost like the show is a large puzzle and each cast member is a significant piece. Tina Fey and Robert Carlock, the geniuses behind the production, were excellent at adding a smorgasbord of funky personalities mixed with some uptight yet still amusing roles such as Mrs. Voorhees, Kimmy<U+2019>s boss who is a young newlywed hell bent on living up to her husband<U+2019>s standards. Additionally, characters such as Titus the flamboyant aspiring Broadway star, Lillian the loony, hipster-esque landlady, and Xanthippe Lannister Voorhees, the pretty, popular and extremely bratty stepdaughter of Jacqueline Voorhees further bring that hilarity and needed ridiculousness. While <U+201C>Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt<U+201D> lacks a realistic plot, the idiosyncrasies of the show<U+2019>s premise and the underlying message of overcoming obstacles and persevering that is elicited through Kimmy<U+2019>s tunnel vision perspective, grounds the show through its first season. Therefore, allow yourself to peel back the layers of each episode and have a laugh at the farcical story of Indiana mole woman Kimberly Schmidt. <U+201C>More Than Just a Solid Game<U+201D>Tanner Huff, age 17The <U+201C>Metal Gear<U+201D> series is hailed as one of the greatest video game series ever developed. I jumped into the series with the chronologically first installment, <U+201C>Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater.<U+201D> After playing through the game, I can say that this is one of the finest games I have known.The <U+201C>Metal Gear<U+201D> series has two main features to make it appealing: a gameplay system that balances action and stealth, and a complex, emotional story. This game delivers on both those points. In gameplay, players are given freedom to tackle challenges however they see fit, from non-lethally neutralizing enemy guards with tranquilizers to passing guards undetected with camouflage or creating a blood bath by running in with lethal weapons, all of which are equally valid and practical methods of facing a challenge, making no two playthroughs identical, with veterans of the game constantly discovering new approaches. The story is set in 1964, the height of the Cold War, as the player controls Naked Snake, an American spy sent into Soviet territory to eliminate a nuclear weapon deemed <U+201C>the Shagohod,<U+201D> and to kill his old mentor, the Boss, who has betrayed her country and defected to the Soviet Union. Without delving into spoilers, the story perfectly balances drama and comedy to tell a story of love and sorrow, patriotism and betrayal, culminating in a scene that leaves most players in tears.What makes <U+201C>Metal Gear Solid 3<U+2033> such a spectacle, however, is not just the gameplay and story, but all the surrounding features that combine to form such an enjoyable experience. The soundtrack, for example, matches the mood of every scene perfectly, whether it be a duel with a superpowered soldier, sneaking through a jungle, or a motorcycle escape. The game<U+2019>s opening theme, Snake Eater, mimics a typical James Bond opening theme, but also sets the tone for the game itself, with the lyrics gaining a much deeper meaning after the game<U+2019>s conclusion. The voice acting is also on point, with each actor portraying his or her character<U+2019>s emotions precisely. Particular note goes to Lori Alan as the Boss, who brings out her pain and sorrow flawlessly in her monologues, especially during the game<U+2019>s climax.<U+201C>Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater<U+201D> is clearly not intended for everyone. The game is rated M for Mature for a strong amount of sexual content, as well as a graphic, grotesque torture scene. The game<U+2019>s complex story also dissuades younger players from playing, as children with simple minds cannot comprehend and keep straight all the characters<U+2019> ideas, goals and motives. The game, however, is inviting to anyone who can stomach all this, and delivers its experience in a truly awe-inspiring manner.<U+201C>Small Pill, Large Punch<U+201D>ICoates, age 16The Beats by Dre name is synonymous with stylish high-end headphones. However, this month Beats released a new, small, powerful, portable speaker, the Beats Pill+, the first product from collaboration between the music-loving Beats producers and Apple Inc., the cutting edge technological developer. The Pill+ is an overdue and exciting upgrade of the original Beats speaker, the Pill. Apple<U+2019>s influence on the design is evident in its minimalist appearance: there are a total of only four buttons that control the unit, and it is only adorned by the well-known Beats logo. Available solely in black or white, the Pill+ is streamlined and alluring. Hidden on the back side of the speaker, Apple provides all the technological luxuries expected of an Apple product, including an AUX input and a charging port for iPhone or external music source powered by the long-lasting 12 hour battery of the speaker. The Pill+ can be paired with a phone or laptop through Bluetooth, and the listening experience can be enhanced by linking two Pill+ speakers, producing a greater sound quality, volume and bass. Addressing concerns about the intensity and quality of sound of the original Pill, the Pill+ employs neodymium magnets, which keep the speakers small but also provide powerful sound output. To improve sound quality, a stereo active 2-way crossover was added. Finally, the tweeter and woofer separation, modeled after acoustic mechanics of professional recording studies, increases sound depth and enhances the speaker<U+2019>s capability for accurately conveying quick and complex songs. The partnership between Apple and Beats has furthered the design of this speaker to great heights making the Beats Pill+ the most desirable portable speaker available on the market today. The Beats Pill+ costs a size able $230 where other portable speakers cost a mere $50, but the favorable combination of strong sound with 4 speakers, reputable Apple technology, an unheard-of 12 hour battery life, as well as the ease of use and the two speaker syncing capability mitigates the higher price. The small, powerful, portable Beats Pill+ is an excellent buy for recreational as well as serious music lovers, and will bring life to any party.<U+201C><U+2018>Jurassic World': A Monstrous Disappointment<U+201D>Tomi Kennedy, age 17It<U+2019>s hard to explain how <U+201C>Jurassic World,<U+201D> directed by Colin Trevorrow and released by Universal Studios, grossed a whopping $651,889,581 since it opened on June 12, 2015 in movie theaters across America. Yes, it has all the makings of a Spielberg sci-fi, action-thriller blockbuster with large, scary monsters, devouring everyone in their sight; a scientist, Dr. Wu (B. D. Wong), who still hasn<U+2019>t learned the consequences of playing God; a good guy, Simon Masrani (Irrfan Kahn), who suffers from a bad case of hubris; a not so nice guy, Vic Hoskins (Vincent D<U+2019>Onofrio), intent on pursuing his own villainous agenda; two annoying teenage brothers (Ty Simpkins and Nick Robinson) who find themselves in danger; and an uptight career woman, Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard), who can<U+2019>t help but make a nuisance of herself, while falling for the film<U+2019>s ruggedly handsome and likable hero, Owen Grady (Chris Pratt). However, even with the movie having all the right ingredients to be a blockbuster hit, <U+201C>Jurassic World<U+201D> falls short because the movie lacks the skill and ingenuity of Steven Spielberg (who introduced us to the frightening world of genetically engineered dinosaurs in <U+201C>Jurassic Park<U+201D> and in <U+201C>The Lost World<U+201D>) to make something old, new and exciting again. Twenty-two years after Jurassic Park was forced to close, Masrani spares no expense to keep John Hammond<U+2019>s (Richard Attenborough) dream alive and opens Jurassic World, an ultra-hi-tech prehistoric amusement park. However, in an effort to attract more tourists to the island resort, the billionaire, Masrani, adds a new dinosaur attraction <U+2014> the Indominus Rex <U+2014> a genetically engineered hybrid dinosaur that is larger, faster, and smarter than the menacing T-Rex. As expected, all hell breaks loose when this clever, mega-monster escapes from its enclosed habitat and goes on a killing rampage. And, as expected, it<U+2019>s up to Owen Grady, with his swagger and years of navy training, to end the carnage and save the day.   Although an action-packed film with great cinematography and visual effects, <U+201C>Jurassic World,<U+201D> rated PG-13, is a movie with a predictable plot that lacks tension; a dialogue that is flat; characters who are bland and boring, and scenes that are just plain dumb, like when Owen and Claire have time to stop and comfort a dying herbivore while her nephews (the annoying teens) are at risk of being eaten alive by the looming Indominus Rex. With the exception of Chris Pratt, who gives a quasi-noteworthy performance, it<U+2019>s the dinosaurs who steal the show, providing the audience with awe and several terrifying moments.  Yes, <U+201C>Jurassic World<U+201D> brought in the big bucks, but that<U+2019>s because it carries the <U+201C>Jurassic Park<U+201D> brand. In truth, it<U+2019>s nothing more than a dopey monster movie.<U+201C>Chicken or Pasta?<U+201D>Chase Moriarty, age 16I don<U+2019>t care if we<U+2019>re over international waters, there must be standards for food. Travel 3,500 feet up, and all these standards are broken. On my American Airlines flight this weekend, I received a complimentary lunch, like dozens of other passengers on my plane. An assortment of mismatched items, <U+201C>originating<U+201D> from all over the world. The main course, served in a tin foil bowl, was an option of spinach pasta or chicken. Not only are those labels incredibly vague, but they didn<U+2019>t hold true to the actual meals served. The pasta, which they only disclosed had spinach, was in a thick cream sauce, and the chicken about half the size of a dollar bill. Still these main courses were hardly the downfall of the meal, it was the accompanying array of snacks. The vaguely familiar trays of food (reminiscing on the time of TV dinners) also included crackers, a whipped cheese, honey bread, a salad and a piece of <U+201C>cherry crumb cake.<U+201D> All of these items, misbranded and disappointing, created an expert facade. Where does a salad constitute a few browning pieces of lettuce, some soggy shards of carrots, and one-half of a grape tomato (yes, not even a whole grape tomato), all paired with a butter pat sized container of <U+201C>Authentic Italian Salad Dressing<U+201D>? Where do you buy <U+201C>fresh<U+201D> bread that is cold to the touch? Is it legal to serve jellied cough syrup under the guise of cherry crumb cake? Out of fear, I put the bread down, and drowned my veggies with a coating of dressing, giving it enough moisture to slide down my throat. Considering my situation, I gained a new understanding of the classic <U+201C>How About That Airline Food<U+201D> comedy trope. The humor doesn<U+2019>t remain in the original joke, but it has forced me to think about our situation today. In a world of such constantly evolving technology, somehow no one has been able to recreate airline food to be better. We<U+2019>ve burned through generations of Boeings and even with the inclusion of personal TV screens, power plugs, and even Wi-Fi, these airlines can<U+2019>t pull it together enough to pull off one miniature meal. Maybe it<U+2019>s all a ploy. By rewarding higher paying customers with better tasting and better quality meals, they can keep you paying ridiculous amounts for some extra leg room and a bigger seat. Maybe since they know you can<U+2019>t get food anywhere else they can just save their money and feed you the dregs of the food industry. Maybe they don<U+2019>t care. Little tip: pick the chicken, there is some rice hidden beneath it, a lonely source of protein in a world of preserved mush. <U+201C>We All Know What You Did Last Summer<U+201D>Grace Pulliam, age 16Last week, my friend informed me that her favorite artist released an insane new single, <U+201C>I Know What You Did Last Summer<U+201D> by Shawn Mendes and Camila Cabello. If you can<U+2019>t figure out the plot from the title, the song opens with the girl confessing scandalous acts with another boy last summer. She begs her boyfriend for forgiveness, and he quickly concedes, closing the single with passionate unity.I<U+2019>m not going to lie, the song is catchy. I knew all of the lyrics after listening two times and can hum the tune. But, if you actually listen to the lyrics, you hear the same message over and over <U+2014> the guy knows what the girl did last summer. Gasp <U+2014> oh no! This song is identical to ninety percent of other songs I<U+2019>ve heard about love. For some reason, though, thousands of teenagers have bought into it. If repetition and mainstream ideas don<U+2019>t make this song catchy, what does?First, a major key plus a moving tempo always drives energy. It makes you want to move! Second, the generic plot relates to every person who hears it. It creates a perfect excuse to hang on to corrupt relationships and ignore the traditional purity that is supposed to unite two people. The song intertwines love, brokenness, and forgiveness <U+2014> three necessities for having a top hit on iTunes. In other words, the songwriter knows how to make money.That doesn<U+2019>t make it right, though. It<U+2019>s no wonder that teenagers get caught up in petty relationships. The driving, upbeat tempo justifies the negative message, allowing people to dance around and feel happy while a girl cheats on a guy, and while he nonchalantly forgives her. Songs like this transform wrong into right and pass this concept into people<U+2019>s lives. Suddenly, it<U+2019>s O.K. to have a <U+201C>summer boyfriend<U+201D> or a <U+201C>friend with benefits.<U+201D> <U+201C>I Know What You Did Last Summer<U+201D> will go down in the history books as just another typical song that corrupts young adults and makes a few people lots of money. It<U+2019>s too bad, though. If you take away the lyrics, the musicality has a unique flair to it. The guitar alone controls the sound, and the full ensemble immediately releases at the song<U+2019>s end.Typical song. Typical story. Relatable. Has a good beat. If you<U+2019>re like the majority of teenagers out there, this song is perfect for you. For me, not so much.<U+201C>Review: Valentino Ready-To-Wear Spring 2016<U+2033>Onanma Okeke, age 17  I didn<U+2019>t get to see the Valentino Ready-To-Wear show because I am not Anna Wintour, but thanks to the Internet I watched the show from behind my laptop in my medium-sized college dorm.Maria Grazia Chiuri and Pierpaolo Piccolo<U+2019>s collection for Valentino was inspired by Africa. My home continent. These two masterminds who have been the creative directors of Valentino since 2007 never fail to blow my mind each collection at a time. They managed to interweave the diverse cultures in Africa and the Italian heritage of the house into a well thought out collection.The first girl who struts down the runway was dressed in a mini maxi d<U+00E9>colletage dress, her hair braided and packed in a bun to reveal her cheekbones that looked like they were kissed by the gods. The dress moved as she walked, every step calculated. A beautiful bronze neckpiece that told a thousand stories adorned her neck.For the next 15 minutes, models strut down the runway dressed in Valentino pieces each with a story to tell. The collection had tribal embroideries skillfully embroidered up and down sleeves and collars of some of the dresses.A coat I particularly loved had beautiful peach embroideries along the button holes. Fur sprang out of the coats<U+2019> sleeves. The embroidery on the sleeves, craftsmanship so precise only a professional can achieve.Another neckpiece that caught my attention was a white neckpiece that look like cowrie beads. Cowrie beads were used as currency in Nigeria many years ago. The designers also incorporated beautiful tribal inspired embroidery in some of the clothing.The evening dresses were to die for as well as the day dresses. The brilliant use of embroidery, fur, pleats, patchwork, colors, embellishment, leather work, tie-dye and silhouette made this Valentino collection one of the best and wearable collections for the spring 2016 fashion season.Maria Grazia Chiuri and Pierpaolo Piccioli translation of my beautiful continent of Africa into a magnificent collection is something that is to be applauded. I could easily see a regal African princess in any of the designs. They never fail to infuse the Italian heritage of Valentino into any of their inspirations. Let<U+2019>s face it, you know a Valentino piece when you see one. It is as graceful as it is beautiful. Bravo Maria Grazia and Pierpaolo Piccioli!<U+201C>An Interview Worth Seeing<U+201D>Bailey Ottley, age 17The 1994 film adaptation of Anne Rice<U+2019>s <U+201C>Interview with the Vampire<U+201D> is spine-chillingly fantastic! Neil Jordan and his killer cast consisting of Academy Award nominees and Golden Globe winners Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise, Kirsten Dunst and Antonio Banderas knock the lid off this tale of the undead by bringing the deep characters of Anne Rice to life. This is no trashy, supernatural romance created for a young, hormonal audience; this is a gory, dark look into the suffering of an immortal creature hoping to find not only the meaning of eternal existence, but also if there are others out there like him. When a mysterious stranger gives Louis (Brad Pitt) the choice of death or immortality after the tragic loss of his wife and unborn child, Louis throws himself into his own personal hell by entering into the world of the supernatural. With a <U+201C>lingering respect for human life,<U+201D> Pitt has created a powerful, melancholy creature facing what looks like an eternity alone. After adopting Claudia (Kirsten Dunst), Louis begins to lose his humanity piece by piece and although Pitt<U+2019>s fatherly moments are endearing, you can<U+2019>t help but mourn for him throughout his performance. But what is a vampire without his sire? Lestat (Tom Cruise) never has a dull moment <U+2014> from torturing Louis to killing for sport and even <U+201C>dying<U+201D> multiple times, Cruise has created a dangerous, manipulative being that the viewer is forced to hate and love simultaneously. His <U+201C>split personality<U+201D> often leaves the audience excited to see what version of Lestat will be portrayed in each scene; and as viewers watch the chemistry between Cruise and Pitt, they are left craving more. Neil Jordan has engineered a perfectly balanced movie. His multiple death scenes are vivid and powerful, as seen during the show at the Theatre du Vampire when the audience is unaware of the actual death of a human woman in front of their eyes. The tension in that scene is like an old rubber band about to snap, suspenseful and dangerous. When watching, it is hard to draw the eyes away from the story long enough to appreciate the amazing set and special effects that accompany this film. From statues to ashes, Jordan could not have found a better artistic team. To all the fans of the novel, Neil Jordan has created an accurate rendition to the original piece that Anne Rice would be proud of. In fact, in a 2014 interview she confessed that she <U+201C>felt like [she] was watching [her] characters on the screen,<U+201D> so to all die hard fans out there, this is a must see. To all others, this is an opportunity that any mortal would not dare to miss.<U+201C>A Look Back at N.W.A.<U+2019>s <U+2018>Straight Outta Compton'<U+201D>Kedar Ramanathan, age 18As the N.W.A. biopic, <U+201C>Straight Outta Compton,<U+201D> was released over the summer, we as a nation have been inclined to revisit the album that changed music history. <U+201C>Straight Outta Compton<U+201D> is ridden with brutal honesty. The music is a reflection of the reality in Compton, which is why the lyrics are so explicit, and must be to have the right effect. The lyrics are beautiful images of a terrible life. The beats fit perfectly to the hard-core rhymes. Altogether, the album is a masterpiece, with songs that evoke every emotion imaginable. Considered one of the greatest rap albums of all time, the album is an hourlong story shown to us through the eyes of five young, black men from Compton, California. Compton is one of the most dangerous cities in America, and has been for a long, long time. Knowing this, it won<U+2019>t come as a surprise to find out that N.W.A.<U+2019>s story is filled with vulgarity <U+2014> drugs, prostitution, gangs, murder. Certain people, mostly parents, dislike N.W.A. due to the fact that their lyrics contain strong language. The federal government also disliked N.W.A., but for one song in particular. <U+201C>F*ck Tha<U+2019> Police<U+201D> became a huge hit, talking about the realities of violence and police brutality. It even became an anthem of the Rodney King Riots in California. The song takes place in a courtroom, and depicts the police wrongfully arresting the rappers. Ice Cube opens the song with a big hit, saying the police treat every minority as if they were drug dealers. MC Ren and Eazy-E continue the song with the same purpose: to show just how bad the police system is in Compton. The song was the only song ever to be banned by the federal government.Another song, <U+201C>Dopeman (Remix),<U+201D> shares a story of drug life. This song is against the criminal life that people thought they advocated. Ice Cube narrates the story of a crack dealer and his customers, and calls crack users stupid for doing it. He talks about men who crave the drug and will literally kill for a hit, and a girl named Strawberry, a girl who sells her body for it. Eazy-E then takes the mic as the <U+201C>Dopeman,<U+201D> describing his life of wealth and luxury. The group shows how people in the ghettos become drug dealers and pimps because those are the people that get rich in the <U+2018>hood. So instead of taking this work of art as a malicious album to incite crime, people should take it as it really is <U+2014> a beautiful narration of a life filled with struggle.<U+201C><U+2018>Scream Queens': Hilariously Good or Horrifically Bad?<U+201D>Rayner Reinhardt, age 14America has been dying of laughter every Tuesday at 9 p.m. since September 22,2015, when Fox aired their new horror-comedy TV series, <U+201C>Scream Queens.<U+201D>Fox<U+2019>s new TV series has brought back the stereotypical mean girl in a hilariously horrific setting. The show follows Kappa Kappa Tau Sorority President, Chanel Oberlin [Emma Roberts], at Wallace University. Chanel has the looks, attitude and rich daddy that together create the main mean girl. Kappa faces the threat of a masked serial killer that targets the house. The murderer, dressed as a Red Devil, strikes at the house and across the campus, while students and administration try to catch the killer. The show flashes back to the 1994 Kappa House and forward to 2015 as flashbacks show connections between the current crisis and events that happened in the past. This twist draws in audiences of older generations, in addition to the teenagers, because of the frequent pop culture references to old horror movies.<U+201C>Scream Queens<U+201D> greatly resembles some of the classics. Like <U+201C>Heathers,<U+201D> Chanel<U+2019>s loyal Kappa minions all have the same name: Chanel. The characters in the show also take on the comedy style and self-awareness of Scream. Not only is the show a twist on a horror film, but it also has a comedy flare. Jokes are often made to resemble classic films, but some are just plain ridiculous <U+2014> so stupid they make anyone laugh. The comedy can be a little much sometimes, with crude references to sex and drugs, and even audiences comfortable with this type of humor might squirm.Humor is definitely one of the things that carries the show, but some of the jokes also can be seen as promoting bullying. <U+201C>Scream Queens<U+201D> brings back the typical mean girl who is usually a perpetrator of bullying. Some may view this as antagonistic, as Chanel continues to verbally abuse the sisters. This is very different from the recent outburst of anti-bullying programs, such as the TV-show Glee and the movie Cyberbully. But, in a way the show takes an anti-bullying stance, too, as many of the sisters are strong individual women who stand up for themselves and others. The girls take on this role when they stand up to Chanel<U+2019>s unfair abuse of power. What unifies each episode is a new murder by the Red Devil. Every murder is a little different, but what keeps them similar is the element of surprise. No one knows who<U+2019>s going to be murdered or when. This twisted course of events keeps the viewer hooked. Overall, <U+201C>Scream Queens<U+2019>s<U+201D> comedy-infused horror plotline has me dying to watch more. Don<U+2019>t miss the next episode, or else<U+2026>. <U+201C><U+2018>South Park<U+2019> Analysis<U+201D>Tristan, age 16 Trey Parker and Matt Stone<U+2019>s <U+201C>South Park<U+201D> first debuted in August of 1997 on the Comedy Central channel. This satirical and dark sitcom follows the story of four South Park, Colorado natives named: Kyle, Stan, Eric and Kenny, as they live out their crazy fourth-grade lives. The animated series received tremendous acclaim, and quickly became one of the top rated shows on the network. The show would eventually be nominated for five Emmy Awards, spawn a feature film, and be ranked as the tenth greatest cartoon in history (tvguide.com). The beauty of the show is its refusal to shy away from controversy. Though crude, the show poses an unorthodox sense of honesty. <U+201C>South Park<U+201D> isn<U+2019>t afraid to satirize touchy topics such as the Prophet Muhammad, Scientology, celebrity suicides and cancer. The show aims to challenge popular opinion, promoting independent thought. In recent episodes, the show has poked fun at more current issues, like police violence, transgender rights, political correctness, immigration and Donald Trump in a way that is taboo, yet important to listen to in the sensitive society that we live in today. The graphic design of the show is a visual representation of its message. The show was originally animated in a stop-motion animation style with paper cutouts, but became digital over the years to speed up the production process. The creators decided to stay with the paper cutout design through the transition, giving the show an ironic look of simplicity and purity. The visual look serves as a reminder to the viewers that the show<U+2019>s priority isn<U+2019>t necessarily in its images, but rather in its messages. The look of the characters are also unique compared to other cartoons, allowing them to be quickly and easily identifiable in pop-culture. In final thoughts, the show is incredible. The dark humor and mature content of the show can often go too far, upsetting viewers, but it serves as a way to keep the program identifiable and surrounded itself with controversy. It has never failed to enlighten me on new topics, or to help me rethink old ones. The humor is immature, but the overall writing is immensely clever. <U+201C>South Park<U+201D> is a truly remarkable milestone in American television, with no other competitors as crude or clever. <U+201C>Ordinary People Can Change the World<U+201D> by Kenneth Vargas, age 13<U+201C>One child, one teacher, one pen, and one book can change the world.<U+201D>These are the words of Pakistani girl Malala Yousafzai, an ordinary Muslim refugee of her own country. In a sort of educational prison where girls are not allowed to go to school and are unable to pursue a career of their own, something that Malala believes and knows cannot stand in her or in any country. And through it all, director David Guggenheim explores the great courage and bravery that it took Malala to obtain to stand up to the powerful Taliban in his latest documentary <U+201C>He Named Me Malala.<U+201D>Daily life, conferences and emotional flashbacks of both sweeter and darker moments of Malala<U+2019>s life highlight this remarkable documentary, creating a deep and profound message that the influence of family can guide one to the path that they choose, despite propaganda and external oppression. Malala herself reveals the secret to her extraordinary and busy life as she asserts to the interviewer, <U+201C>I am a normal girl. If I had a normal family: a normal father, a normal mother, I would<U+2019>ve had two children by now.<U+201D> After leaving the dark theater, credits rolling on screen, I suddenly obtained this undeniable feeling of empowerment. Even though I knew I was a regular citizen among millions of others, I felt like I could suddenly start a revolution against whatever greed and immoral acts happening around the world. Malala is a beacon of hope for me that signals the potential that otherwise feeble people have to change the whole way of thinking in a society, perhaps even the world. I realized then the power and influence that this incredible girl has on past, present and future generations: the power to drive and instill the mind-set that anyone, no matter in what position they are in, can change any aspect of injustice. This riveting film enraptures the bravery in all humans, however powerless they may seem next to tyranny and government. There are moments of boredom however, losing the audience instead of consistently grasping them. And there are moments where one feels lost or collectively done with the same old narrative that maneuvers the film. But if one manages to stay through the whole documentary, the underlying and empowering message will be revealed and it will all be worth the wait. Malala<U+2019>s story of a youth striving to rise against injustice is a story worth being told and a film worth being watched.<U+201C>A Journey Underground<U+201D>Noah Young, age 15<U+201C>Down here<U+2026> It<U+2019>s kill or be killed!<U+201D> Despite being such an utterly simple game, Toby Fox<U+2019>s <U+201C>Undertale<U+201D> manages to bring a life-changing story to life. Most games of this century consist of compellingly realistic graphics, pulling you into a world that looks like our own, while <U+201C>Undertale<U+201D> sticks with a very pixelated 8-Bit look, not something one would expect to see this year. The game begins with explaining its simple premise; long ago, there was a War between humans and monsters, finally ending with monsters being banished to the Underground, never to walk the surface again, as the exit is blocked by a force called the barrier. However, a small child falls into a chasm leading to the Underground, and finds himself now on a quest to find his way back to the surface. Thus, the game begins. At the beginning of <U+201C>Undertale,<U+201D> you are found and cared for by a friendly monster, named Toriel. On the way to Toriel<U+2019>s house, you are given wisdom by characters along the way, learning how to interact with monsters approaching you throughout the game. In fights with monsters, you are given three main options. You can FIGHT to kill the monster, ACT to interact with the monster in a variety of ways, or SPARE the monster, allowing it to live. Although being told by wise frogs during the tutorial to always spare a monster when possible, the game adapts to your decisions, and the choice of whether to kill or spare the opponent is up to you.The simplicity of <U+201C>Undertale<U+201D> seems outrageous, but it is as simple as it looks. The gameplay isn<U+2019>t the only great thing, however. The game is also now famous for its incredible soundtrack, made single-handedly by the game<U+2019>s creator, Toby Fox. Unless it is intended for there to be no music, there is always a different track playing everywhere you go, when interacting with different people. As well as the music, the game has haunting morals. As previously mentioned, how you interact with different opponents determines the outcome of your game. Through this, the player is able to truly learn the true value of life, and how it comes to affect others. In conclusion, <U+201C>Undertale<U+201D> is a hauntingly simple game. Despite this, it manages to create a new world in the player<U+2019>s hands, presented through a compelling, yet dark story. Judges: Richard Adams, Amanda Christy Brown, Georgia Faust, Michael Gonchar, Annissa Hambouz, Shira Katz," Katherine Schulten and Kate Spence-Ado.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,https://news.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/10/30/morning-agenda-valeant-drops-philidor/,10/30/15,"VALEANT DROPS PHILIDOR  |  Valeant Pharmaceuticals said Friday it was dropping a mail-order pharmacy at the center of a growing controversy over its dispensing relationship with the drug maker, The New York Times reports. The pharmacy, Philidor Rx Services, <U+201C>will shut down operations as soon as possible,<U+201D> Valeant said in a news release.The move came after the three largest American drug benefit managers, Express Scripts, CVS Health Health and OptumRx, said they would stop paying for drugs dispensed by the pharmacy, as Andrew Pollack reports.<U+201C>The newest allegations about activities at Philidor raise additional questions about the company<U+2019>s business practices,<U+201D> J. Michael Pearson, Valeant<U+2019>s chairman and chief executive, said in the news release. <U+201C>We have lost confidence in Philidor<U+2019>s ability to continue to operate in a manner that is acceptable to Valeant and the patients and doctors we serve.<U+201D>DEAL-MAKING FRENZY IN THE HEALTH CARE SECTOR  |  Pfizer<U+2019>s efforts to renounce its citizenship by buying a foreign rival could lead to a messy fight with lawmakers in Washington, asMichael J. de la Merced and Leslie Picker report in DealBook.The prospect of a deal between Pfizer and Allergan has already attracted criticism from Capitol Hill. Pfizer<U+2019>s tax rate will be about 25 percent this year and Ian C. Read, the chief executive, has made no secret of his disdain for it. He says it leaves Pfizer at a competitive disadvantage against foreign rivals. Pfizer has already tried to reduce its taxes through an inversion, in which it buys a company headquartered abroad and moves its corporate home there. It approached AstraZeneca, but the takeover fell apart and prompted the Treasury department to tighten guidelines and make inversions less appealing. But that did not dent Mr. Read<U+2019>s interest. Now Pfizer is taking aim at Allergan, which is domiciled in Ireland and reported an effective tax rate of just 4.8 percent last year. Its tax rate this year is about 15 percent.The new Treasury rules mean that an inversion would need a larger target to be beneficial. Allergan<U+2019>s shareholders would need to own 40 percent of the combined company. This means they will have to be creative about the structure of the deal as Pfizer<U+2019>s market value is nearly twice the size of Allergan<U+2019>s. Allergan has the upper hand in this situation, John Foley writes in Breakingviews. It would only have 34 percent of the combined group based on their latest traded values so Pfizer would need to pay a premium out of whatever savings it hoped to make on its taxable profit. Allergan could demand a big chunk of that itself. Pfizer may well decide to squeeze more value out of the deal by cutting costs at Allergan, but Brent Saunders, Allergan<U+2019>s chief executive, may well prefer to do that through acquisitions of his own.  If successful, the talks could lead to the biggest deal of the year, after a booming $270 billion worth of mergers and acquisitions just in the first nine months of 2015 in the United States. Health care companies from drug makers to insurers are frantically circling to avoid missing out on the deal making frenzy, Reed Abelson writes in DealBook.The tax aspects are important in this deal, but companies across the health care sector are also buying each other up fueled by low interest rates, cheap capital and a need to restructure in response to changes under the Affordable Care Act. Even hospitals are supersizing and Accenture predicts that they will start buying specialty medical groups, adding clinics or digital health companies to their structures.THE LONG SHADOW OF EUROPEAN BANKS  |  The role played by Europe<U+2019>s banks in damping the mood on the Continent was on full display when Deutsche Bank announced its overhaul,Peter Eavis reports in DealBook.It had made efforts to adapt and harbored ambitions to continue being a dominant player on Wall Street, but its returns had fallen well below its peers there. Companies in the United States borrow heavily in the bond markets as well as from banks, so when banks faltered after the crisis, companies still had a deep pool of capital to tap. European companies, however, rely heavily on bank loans so the banks need to be in good shape if the continent is to see sustained growth. European banks avoided a thorough cleanup until they had to start subjecting themselves to regulatory examinations last year. The amount of nonperforming loans they have on their books is equivalent to roughly 10 percent of the gross domestic product of the eurozone and this may have weighed on the region<U+2019>s economic performance.Deutsche Bank shows why the European financial system may take a while to catch up but its latest strategic change may be a sign that even a powerful bank that pushed back hard against postcrisis regulations sees no alternative but to adopt the streamlining that has made banks more efficient in the United States. ON THE AGENDA  |  Pershing Square Capital Management will hold a conference call to discuss its investment in Valeant Pharmaceuticals at 9 a.m. The Federal Reserve board meets at 2:30 p.m. to discuss rules on loss-absorbing capacity and long-term debt at banks and margin and capital requirements for uncleared swaps.RUSHCARD TO REIMBURSE CUSTOMERS  |  RushCard, the prepaid debit card company plagued with technology problems this month, said it would pay $2 million to $3 million to refund customers for losses and inconvenience,Liz Moyer reports in DealBook.The amount in the reimbursement fund would vary depending on how many people take up the refund, executives said. It will not be releasing details until it gets regulatory approval. <U+201C>We take accountability,<U+201D> said Rick Savard, RushCard<U+2019>s chief executive.Mr. Savard said RushCard was in contact with regulators and would have a number of meetings with them about what happened and how it could be remedied. RushCard had already announced that it would eliminate card fees for current and new customers from now until the end of February 2016. Executives said the costs of the reimbursement fund and the lost fee revenue would amount to the company<U+2019>s profits for this year, which they said was its best ever.Mr. Savard said the process for filing for a refund through the reimbursement fund should be up and running in a few weeks. The technical problem had occurred while RushCard was converting its systems to MasterCard<U+2019>s processing platform and that had cascaded into its other technology.

7,https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/08/28/can-republicans-paint-the-white-house-red/,8/28/13,"Democrats may dream of 16 years of dominance, but on Nov. 8, 2016, it is entirely possible that Americans will elect a Republican president. It is even possible, although less likely, that Republicans will be in full control of the federal government: the White House, the Senate, the House of Representatives and the Supreme Court.A dominant theme in contemporary political commentary on the left, the right and the center is that the Republican Party faces a grave crisis of both demographics and ideology. But despite the cacophony of fault finding, caution is in order before we declare the Republican Party down for the count. To explore the possibility of a Republican revival in 2016, I spoke with a number of Republican strategists, including Stuart Stevens, who ran the Romney campaign in 2012; Patrick Ruffini, president of Engage, a digital consulting company; and Bill McInturff, founder of Public Opinion Strategies.Stevens is a critic of the doom-and-gloom approach. He argues that a successful 2016 Republican presidential scenario can be credibly pieced together. Here are some of the hypotheticals that might lead to victory.One, Hillary Clinton chooses not to run or, as was the case in 2008, falls flat in the primaries and caucuses. This would leave Democrats with second-tier candidates, none of whom can inspire the overall turnout or the specific margins enjoyed by President Obama.Two, public discontent with Obamacare grows. Young voters, a key to recent Democratic victories, bristle over the requirement to buy insurance or pay a fine. Corporate plans cut spousal coverage. Businesses replace full-time workers with part-timers, ineligible for benefits.<U+00A0>Health insurance premiums continue to rise faster than inflation. The discontent with the Affordable Care Act on the part of the three major unions <U+2013> the Teamsters, United Food and Commercial Workers and Unite-Here <U+2013> spreads throughout the labor movement. Glitches in rolling out the massive new health care program increase public opposition (the regulations governing the hiring of health care <U+201C>navigators<U+201D> to help consumers enroll total an estimated 13,900 words in the Federal Register). Increasing numbers of people cannot keep either their current doctor or their health care plan.Three, the stock market and corporate profits rise, but employment continues to lag; more people drop out of the work force; the job market continues to bifurcate, with work at the high and low ends, but less and less in the middle.Four, the Republican primary electorate does not nominate Ted Cruz of Texas or Rand Paul of Kentucky and instead picks Jeb Bush or another mainstream nominee.Ruffini puts the case for 50-50 odds in 2016 in terms of his view that Hillary Clinton is the likely nominee, noting that she carries substantial baggage. <U+201C>Clinton<U+2019>s currently favorable political position,<U+201D> Ruffini wrote me, is a function of the aftermath of the 2008 campaign, where she gained in popularity amongst Republicans as a Democratic foil to Obama, and stayed above the partisan fray as secretary of state. In 2016, that dynamic will no longer apply.In addition, he said, No one wants to say that Hillary Clinton is too old to be president; she is not. But there is a demonstrable bias in recent presidential elections towards a younger candidate being able to successfully contrast stylistically against an older one. Especially if the public mood pivots back towards change in 2016, this is something Clinton will need to navigate, as it seems likely right now that the Republican candidate will personify a generational shift in the electorate. Finally, it should be remembered that we saw how Clinton performed on the campaign trail in 2008 and the results weren<U+2019>t good.Ruffini<U+2019>s bottom line:Clinton is a formidable candidate who can rely on historic levels of support among women and can raise hundreds of millions of dollars online even before the general election. The celebrity factor will propel her. But she won<U+2019>t be able to defy gravity forever.It<U+2019>s relatively easy to draw up a counter-scenario in which Republican prospects in 2016 are dim. Let<U+2019>s say:Just as important, the Electoral College, which throughout the years of Republican ascendancy from the late <U+2019>60s into the early <U+2019>90s tilted to the right, now leans to the left. This map of the United States, <U+201C>The Big Blue Wall,<U+201D> was put together by the Republican polling firm Public Opinion Strategies:The Republican Party<U+2019>s difficulties have prompted some sympathetic analysts to call for a reversal of trickle-down economic policies. Michael Gerson, a former speechwriter for George W. Bush, and Peter Wehner of the Ethics and Public Policy Center argue that Republicans should become visible and persistent critics of corporate welfare: the vast network of subsidies and tax breaks extended by Democratic and Republican administrations alike to wealthy and well-connected corporations.Even Karl Rove, the chief political adviser to an administration that passed two tax cuts favoring the affluent, has caught the populist bug, arguing <U+201C>there is too much corporate welfare and there are too many breaks that benefit the big guys and the people who<U+2019>ve already got it.<U+201D> With no evident embarrassment, Rove told an Aspen Institute conference on the future of the Republican Party:So we got a tax system that benefits the big guy over the little guy and we need to reform it and we got a government with way too much benefits that flow to the people who<U+2019>ve got the money that keeps us from providing the resources necessary to the people who don<U+2019>t have money and also keeps us all paying too much in taxes, because they<U+2019>re running up too much of debt, because most of that corporate welfare, if not all of it, is being paid for by borrowed money we don<U+2019>t have.David Leege, an emeritus professor of political science at the University of Notre Dame, believes Republicans have a good shot in 2016 because their disparate and often conflicting factions <U+201C>will unite around an even more elemental fear <U+2014> threats to the preservation of white male rule.<U+201D> Leege argues in an e-mail to The Times:2016 could look good for Reps. They are the party of fresh faces. Dems are the party of old faces. Reps have taken advantage of Citizens United and will (illegally) do as good a job of coordinating almost limitless gifts between PACs and the candidate<U+2019>s campaign organization, as the Dems did in 2012 with <U+201C>limited<U+201D> funds.Steve Ansolabehere, a political scientist at Harvard, is even more bullish on Republican prospects: I think they have a better than 50-50 shot at the presidency. It is very hard for a party to win the presidency three times in a row <U+2014> since WW II, only the run of Reagan-Bush. There are a lot of divisions in the G.O.P., but there is no shortage of respectable candidates.The post-World War II historical record favors a Republican victory in 2016, according to David Mayhew, a political scientist at Yale. He pointed out that in five of the six <U+201C>open<U+201D> elections since World War II (open meaning without an incumbent candidate), the candidate representing the party holding the White House lost. In 2016, the Democratic nominee will fit that definition. Mayhew noted, however, that six elections is too small a sample from which to draw strong conclusions.Both Mayhew and Arthur Lupia, a political scientist at the University of Michigan, contend that Republican power brokers should be able to force enough of a change in the direction of the party to be competitive. Lupia wrote in an e-mail responding to a Times inquiry asking him to assess the competitive strength of the parties:Establishment Republicans have room to extend their base and their appeal. The incremental changes that we are seeing on issues such as immigration, same-sex marriage and climate change set the stage for a person with conservative bona fides to draw support from the ideological center of the U.S. population. Slight changes in G.O.P. primary rules and more strategic use of money by establishment Republican money people will give centrists more advantages than they had in 2008 and 2012.Along parallel lines, Mayhew wrote:Generally speaking, out-parties adapt. They take advantage of various party-in-office erosions, they adjust to changing demographics, and they play a good game in candidate choice and issue positioning.The issues at play in presidential campaigns are often different from those in House and Senate races. Control of the Senate could turn out to be a bigger hurdle for the Republican Party than winning the White House. Republicans have a decent chance of taking control next year, but even if they do, the party will have a tough time retaining control in 2016.The view among nonpartisan election experts on the 2014 Senate races is generally similar. Charlie Cook described the odds asa little less than 50-50 for G.O.P. takeover. Don<U+2019>t know if you have seen our Senate math worksheet. Republicans have a very narrow but not uphill path to a majority. They have to almost run the table, but the states aren<U+2019>t tough ones.Stuart Rothenberg, editor and publisher of The Rothenberg Political Report, told me that he expects Republicans to pick up from three to six seats. <U+201C>As you know, the Rs need to net six seats to take the Senate. So we characterize the Senate as <U+2018>in play.<U+2019><U+201D>Larry Sabato, a professor of political science at the University of Virginia, wrote in an e-mailed response to a Times inquiry:I look at it this way. Heavy odds that Republicans will pick up seats, net, in 2014. Right now, it looks like +3 or +4. They need +6 to gain control. So Democrats are early slight favorites to retain control of the Senate. All the Republicans need, though, is a medium-sized wave to take 6. They already probably have W.V., S.D., and Mont. <U+2014> currently all D seats with vacating incumbents. It<U+2019>s 50-50 in Ark. for Sen. Mark Pryor (D) vs. Rep. Tom Cotton (R). Sens. Mary Landrieu (D-La.) and Mark Begich (D-Ark.) are slight favorites to hold their seats <U+2014> but a medium wave could unseat them. That<U+2019>s potentially +6 for the G.O.P.Cook, Rothenberg and Sabato are looking at the 2014 Senate contests. In 2016, however, the advantage in Senate elections will shift back to the Democrats. Of the 34 Senators up for election, 24 are Republicans, including those holding seats in highly competitive states like New Hampshire, Iowa, Wisconsin, Ohio, Illinois and Pennsylvania. The only 2016 Democratic seats in toss-up states are in Nevada and Colorado.The ingredient missing so far in this discussion of the future of the Republican Party is the American business community. The Republican Party has been the political home of corporate America for generations.At the moment, the Tea Party faction has become a major problem for business interests on at least three fronts. First, by blocking immigration reform, a top priority of the business lobby. Second, by calling for rejection of legislation raising the debt ceiling, the Tea Party promotes economic uncertainty, and uncertainty is itself anathema to commercial interests. Third, the radicalism of the Tea Party threatens the viability of the Republican Party, the political arm of business.The future of the Republican Party will in large part be determined by the outcome of the internal struggle between the Tea Party faction and the pro-business establishment wing. Over the long haul, this is not a fight between equals. Prospects favor a revived pro-business, anti-regulatory Republican Party that purposefully narrowcasts <U+2014> that is, carefully restricts to a select audience <U+2014> its focus on divisive social and cultural issues, just as the Democratic Party, which had lost three presidential elections in a row, lowered its liberal profile in the 1990s. The compelling mandate for a national political party in the United States is not to serve as ideological advocate, but to win.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/11/06/in-los-angeles-unions-show-signs-of-life/,11/6/14,"Gabriela Ochoa is a vivacious woman who buses tables at the Landings Restaurant at the Holiday Inn near Los Angeles International Airport, a job she has held since 2001.This year has been a good year for Ochoa, 45, and her husband, who is a supervisor at a vegetable packing company. They have two adult children, a teenager and 6-year-old twins, and they can afford to give the twins treats. <U+201C>I can take them to IHOP or to the aquarium,<U+201D> she said. She hadn<U+2019>t seen her family in Mexico for years, but this summer Ochoa, her husband and the twins took a two-week vacation to Michoac<U+00E1>n to visit them.She can get herself a new pair of sneakers without worrying about the money. The family owns its house. <U+201C>My older children joke that they didn<U+2019>t have what the kids have now,<U+201D> she said. <U+201C>Now the twins have more food in the fridge, a gallon of milk instead of a small carton, more toys. I take them to Chuck E. Cheese.<U+201D>Ochoa can do these things because in 2006, the City Council passed a law mandating a $10.64 hourly wage and health benefits for hotel workers on Century Boulevard, the corridor of 13 large hotels just outside the entrance to LAX. After legal squabbles, it went into effect in 2008.Ochoa<U+2019>s salary has gone up to $12.16 an hour, plus tips shared by the waiters. The living-wage law, however, isn<U+2019>t as important to that increase as unionization has been. Last year, Unite Here Local 11, a union of hotel, restaurant and airport workers with about 20,000 members, unionized the Holiday Inn. Now she also has a guaranteed 40-hour workweek and health insurance for her family.A few years ago, her situation was very different. She started work at $7.15 per hour, and when the law was passed had been making $9.15 <U+2014> plus tips, but work was scant. <U+201C>Sometimes we<U+2019>d go in and after three hours, they<U+2019>d say, <U+2018>O.K., we have no more work today, go home.<U+2019><U+201C>We hardly ate. We bought what was on special <U+2014> rice, pasta, beans, milk a tiny carton at a time.<U+201D> Sometimes she went to her church for food packages. They owned a house, but couldn<U+2019>t keep up payments, and lost it. <U+201C>I was always anxious <U+2014> the money is going to run out.<U+201D>What happened to Ochoa is starting to happen all over the United States. Not unionization: The decline of organized labor is accelerating. It used to be that a third of private sector workers belonged to a union. Now one in 20 does.<U+00A0> The unionization rate has not been this low since 1916.Unite Here is growing in Los Angeles, however, especially in the LAX zone, where it has unionized five hotels since 2007. Ochoa is enthusiastically active in the union, and I met her on a picket line outside the Westin Los Angeles Airport hotel. About 60 hotel workers were on a one-day strike with signs and bullhorns, marching back and forth chanting the classic labor slogans in Spanish. It seemed like a throwback, a relic of the past.But this week, four states passed new laws raising the minimum wage: Arkansas, Alaska, South Dakota and Nebraska. You could call it one of the few bright spots for Democrats <U+2014> except that it<U+2019>s really not a Democratic issue any more. These laws passed overwhelmingly even in Republican states <U+2014> because they bypassed state legislatures and went straight to voters.More than 120 cities, including conservative ones like San Diego, have living-wage laws, most of them affecting workers in businesses that contract with or receive subsidies from the city. Los Angeles was one of the first, in 1997. Mayor Bill de Blasio just expanded (pdf) New York City<U+2019>s law to cover more workers in September.Also in September, the Los Angeles City Council approved a minimum hourly wage of $15.37 for workers at all big hotels in Los Angeles <U+2014> it will take effect next year. Mayor Eric Garcetti wants to raise the minimum wage for all workers in the city to $13.25 per hour over the next three years.Los Angeles has focused on hotel workers because hotels get lots of city help and benefits. But it<U+2019>s also because hotel workers are among the poorest in the city <U+2014> the new law<U+2019>s preamble says that 43 percent of hotel workers in Los Angeles earn wages that put them <U+201C>far below the federal poverty line.<U+201D> And hotel workers in the LAX corridor earned 20 percent below the average hotel worker in Los Angeles County.What is happening in the airport zone is an intersection of unionization and rising wages for all that used to be commonplace. In the 1940s, when unions were at their peak, they lifted wages not only for their members, but for workers who didn<U+2019>t belong to a union. Jake Rosenfeld, the author of the new book <U+201C>What Unions No Longer Do,<U+201D> writes that nonunion workplaces would often match the wages and benefits of union shops. One reason they did it, of course, was to keep out the union.<U+00A0>But Rosenthal, who is an associate professor of sociology at the University of Washington, argues that other companies copied the practices of industry leaders <U+2014> and those leaders tended to be unionized.The decline of unions has led to lower wages because fewer workers now make union scale. But Rosenthal says that unions have lost their ability to influence whole industries. Companies still mimic industry leaders <U+2014> but those leaders are not unionized.Organized labor is still a force for raising wages <U+2014> it<U+2019>s happening now largely through its support of living-wage laws. A small part of this is self-interest. Despite their low salaries, for example, big hotels pay considerably better than small ones, and offer more opportunities for advancement. But almost everywhere, living-wage laws apply only to big hotels <U+2014> the new Los Angeles citywide hotel living-wage law will apply next year only to hotels with more than 300 rooms. It will expand to hotels with more than 125 rooms in 2016.The obvious reason is that big hotels are more able to absorb the impact of paying higher salaries. Less obviously, big hotels are the plum targets for unionization, and many of the laws contain clauses allowing workers to waive the wage increases as part of collective bargaining agreements. The $15 living-wage law covering Seattle<U+2019>s SeaTac airport region which passed last year was <U+201C>an incentive for employers to collectively bargain with their employees,<U+201D> according to the Union of Food and Commercial Workers<U+2019> newsletter. The LAX living-wage law may be one reason Unite Here has been so successful in the zone. Once, the labor movement created higher wages for all. Now higher wages for all are helping to keep the labor movement alive.Some opponents of unions use this to try to discredit living-wage laws. But these laws are far more than an organizing tool. Unions have provided the ground troops and often the financing for living wage campaigns around the United States <U+2014> even though their members are usually making above that line and don<U+2019>t benefit <U+2014> because these laws have the potential to make life a little better for millions of workers. As this goal becomes harder and harder to achieve through unionization, organized labor has found other ways.I met more people on the picket line. One was Regla Soto. She came from Cuba in 1980 and has been cleaning rooms at the Westin for 27 years. Her husband, now retired, worked in housekeeping at the Hilton. She used to arrive at home vomiting from anxiety. The family ate meat once a week. The children would ask for clothes and toys their friends had, and Soto could only shake her head. She went to church to get food packets.They managed, with difficulty, until one of her three children died of cancer. <U+201C>I had to choose between burying him and paying for the house,<U+201D> she said. <U+201C>I had to give him a Christian burial.<U+201D> The burial cost $14,000, she said. She took out loans, fell behind on payments, and lost the house.Since then, the living-wage law was passed and Unite Here unionized the Westin. Now Soto makes $14.11 an hour, with time and a half for overtime, and health insurance for the family. They own a house in Compton. After her son<U+2019>s death Soto and her husband formally adopted his daughter. She is now in college, and Soto is able to pay for her books. She has auto insurance now and has plans to send her granddaughter to Arizona for a graduate degree and buy a new living room set. She still goes to church <U+2014> now only to pray.Join Fixes on Facebook and follow updates on twitter.com/nytimesfixes.

9,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/31/business/crossfit-offers-an-exercise-in-corporate-teamwork-too.html,3/31/13,"AT 12:30 p.m. on a Tuesday, the chief executive of Datalogix was spider-crawling across a conference room floor. All around him, account managers and data analysts were thrusting 20-pound medicine balls overhead, while their Spandex-clad co-workers sprinted up and down the lobbys carpeted staircase.A panting, red-faced software developer rested against a railing as a colleague rushed past. Push it, Karin! she cried in encouragement. Minutes later, having regained her strength, the developer was back in the conference room, completing her fourth set of jumping squats while a muscle-bound trainer studied her form.Since the summer of 2010, Datalogix, a Big Data company in Westminster, Colo., has offered these classes, called CrossFit, twice a week for its employees. CrossFit gained early popularity among law enforcement officers and military personnel, but lately, both large and small businesses  judging that fitness programs can bolster employee morale, improve productivity and reduce health insurance premiums  have taken an interest. This fast-growing fitness trend combines weight lifting, gymnastics and endurance training and has attracted more than 10 million practitioners around the world, according to the company, about 60 percent of them women.My enthusiasm for CrossFit knows no bounds, said Eric Roza, 45, Datalogixs supremely fit and upbeat chief executive. In fact, his enthusiasm led him to open with his wife a 10,000-square-foot gym in downtown Boulder, Colo., called CrossFit Sanitas, where he generally works out at 5:30 a.m., five days a week, though he will occasionally join his employees, too.Mr. Roza used to run 100-mile ultramarathons, but he took up CrossFit after an injury in 2008. I got hooked instantly, he said after the conference-room workout, his army-green T-shirt damp with sweat. It was like crack or heroin. So when some Datalogix employees organized their own weight-loss competition three years ago, to see who could lose the most pounds, Mr. Roza began offering CrossFit classes in-house. He hired Pat Burke, the owner of another local CrossFit gym  or box, as its often called because of its spare, no-frills design  to teach the classes.Mr. Burke, a former Marine, brings in barbells, gymnastics rings and medicine balls, depending on the days workout. To vary the routine, he might show up with tractor tires, which Datalogix staff members flip and pound with sledgehammers in the parking lot as their less gung-ho colleagues stare from the windows. Mr. Roza estimates that 50 of the 200 employees at Datalogixs headquarters have taken part in the CrossFit classes. The participants, who sign a waiver of liability for injury, have shed around 300 pounds collectively  or at least that is the figure that Mr. Roza derived from informal employee interviews.There are other, less quantifiable benefits. Karin Eisenmenger, 46, Datalogixs director of order management and the woman running up the stairs past her panting colleague, says the classes unite people from different departments who might otherwise never meet. If you can sweat and groan and moan with your co-workers, she said, youll have no problem working with them in a meeting.Ben Nelson, 31, an information technology analyst who says he lost 60 pounds after he started CrossFit in 2010, said a lunch hour spent doing squat thrusts and swinging kettlebells enabled him to work longer and with greater focus. I used to work for the Dish Network, he said, and the workouts there were running up and down the stairs on the way to company meetings.CROSSFIT is one of many perks at Datalogix, where a range of other options  like self-defense classes and courses in the Java programming language  are available free and in-house. The companys fitness initiatives, called DLX Fit, cost the company around $25,000 a year, Mr. Roza said. A majority of that goes toward CrossFit.Ive been calling CrossFit the new golf, Mr. Roza said. You wouldnt believe how often it comes up in business meetings.CrossFit was started in 2000 in Santa Cruz, Calif., by Greg Glassman, a former gymnastics coach. Over the next decade, it grew from a single gym to a global workout craze. (There are now 42 CrossFit boxes in South Africa alone.) In 2010, a partnership with Reebok further raised CrossFits profile. Reebok has built 15 gyms inside or near its offices around the world, and plans to open 11 more. In most cases, Reebok employees receive their membership at a discount.The largest gym  known as Reebok CrossFit One, a cavernous, 12,000-square-foot space with six on-site coaches, 14 climbing ropes and one cargo climbing net, among other equipment  is at Reeboks headquarters in Canton, Mass. According to Chris Froio, Reeboks global head of fitness and training, more than 300 employees visit the gym every day. Like most CrossFit gyms, CrossFit One offers classes for a variety of skill levels, and workouts are scaled according to ability.So it isnt unusual to find Anne McKay, 74, an accounting clerk, carrying five-pound sandbags beside Kenneth Gamble, a former running back for the Kansas City Chiefs and a Reebok executive, whose sandbags of choice often exceed 100 pounds.Such exertions, without appropriate supervision, can lead to injuries. In 2008, Makimba Mimms, a former Navy information systems technician, sued a World Gym, a CrossFit affiliate training company and one of its employees in Manassas, Va., contending that an especially intense CrossFit workout caused a condition in which muscle fibers deteriorate and enter the bloodstream, leading to kidney damage. A jury awarded Mr. Mimms $300,000 in damages.To prevent injuries, Reebok says its coaches at CrossFit One closely monitor all participants, who are also required to sign liability waivers. We are invested in taking care of you, its Web site reads.Clearly, CrossFit is not for everyone. A vast majority of employees at companies where its offered do not participate. And the cultish enthusiasm it inspires could make people with no interest in exercising feel excluded in the workplace.Tim Shea, 26, a data analyst at Datalogix, noted that watching dozens of his co-workers rolling around on a conference room floor can make you feel like you should be involved. But he has resisted, preferring to hike and to mountain-bike after work. I like some more adventure with my workouts, he said.Dr. Toni Yancey, a professor of health services at the University of California, Los Angeles, is all for people getting more exercise at work. But she says she thinks that incorporating movement into sedentary office routines makes more sense than pushing something like CrossFit, which is unlikely to engage a large portion of the average workplace. Dance breaks, walking to meetings together, sitting on balls  these things integrate physical movement into the daily routine, she said. And you dont have to shower afterward.The need to shower hasnt bothered the avid users at Reeboks centers, and other companies have taken notice. ESPN and the sports retailer Finish Line consulted Reebok in designing their own CrossFit boxes. In 2011, Mr. Glassman helped put a team of Microsoft senior engineers through a weekend-long Level 1 Certification course. There are now 40 CrossFit trainers inside Microsoft, he said, and theyre teaching other people how to do it.James Letchford, CrossFits chief marketing officer, said that a couple hundred companies in the United States and Europe offered classes and subsidized memberships for their staff.Perhaps the most ardent of these businesses is HGST, formerly Hitachi Global Storage Technologies, a seller of hard disk drives that was acquired by Western Digital in 2012. Mike Cordano, the president of HGST and an experienced CrossFitter, opened a fully staffed, employees-only CrossFit gym on each of its two campuses in San Jose, Calif., last October, in partnership with a local affiliate called NorCal CrossFit.Each of HGSTs new CrossFit affiliates pays a $3,000 annually renewable fee to use the CrossFit name, and Mr. Cordano plans to introduce the program at HGST offices in Minnesota and Colorado in April, then at sites in Asia this summer.CrossFits ability to foster camaraderie among co-workers  at least among those motivated to experiment with Olympic-style weight lifting  is especially suited to the life-swallowing rigors of start-up culture.A battle-hardened Green Beret once told me that CrossFit taught him the recipe for camaraderie, which is agony coupled with laughter, said Mr. Glassman, who is 56. He was talking about combat situations, but Id expect to hear the same from guys writing code.EMPLOYEES of Neverware, a small tech start-up company in Manhattan, agree that CrossFit reinforces workplace cooperation. When we were spotting each other on squats, we literally had each others backs, said Daniel Ryan, 22, a software developer and Princeton student who was an intern at the company last year.Until recently, the Neverware team worked out three times a week at CrossFit NYC. The workouts took place around 3 p.m.  the hour when employees had begun to nod off  and offered a much-needed interruption in 12- to 15-hour workdays. Jonathan Hefter, 27, the C.E.O., said he expected his staff members, then all men, to participate.For us, CrossFit was a major team-building exercise, he said. If someone didnt join in, it caused problems.But since January, Neverware, which builds servers that schools can use to make their dated computers run like new, has grown rapidly. Im also traveling more, and spending up to 10 hours a day in meetings, Mr. Hefter said. With the growing demand, the team cant afford to leave the office for two hours in the middle of the afternoon.While a few of Neverwares software engineers continue to go to CrossFit NYC, Mr. Hefter has moved to New York Sports Club, which better accommodates his chaotic new schedule. I definitely miss working out with the team, he said, a bit wistfully. But its not like we cant go back. Itd be a sign of a successful organization if our schedules became predictable enough to keep doing CrossFit together.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/02/us/politics/republicans-refuel-effort-to-cripple-health-care-law.html,8/2/13,"WASHINGTON   With the House poised to vote Friday on yet another bill to cripple President Obamas health care law, the question arises: Why do Republicans persist in their so-far futile efforts?Democrats have many theories. Republicans, they suggest, care little about the uninsured. Many, they say, dislike Mr. Obama and want him to fail.The health care law has become the Republicans great white whale, Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California, said Thursday. They will stop at nothing to kill it.Republicans say they persist because the law is an example of government overreach and is proving unworkable. For many elected in the 2010 Republican wave, their opposition to the law is the reason they are in Congress. And, they say, voting to repeal the law is good politics, as it remains extremely unpopular among Republican voters.Republicans and some business owners also say they resent the way in which the law was written and passed by Democrats in 2009-10. Jeffrey S. Kelly, the chief executive of Hamill Manufacturing, a small Pennsylvania company that produces metal parts for Navy ships, made that point at a recent hearing to examine the effects of the law on businesses.Havent you really reaped what youve sown? Mr. Kelly asked House Democrats. Look at the history of this law. It was passed without any support on the Republican side.Though the White House and Congressional Democrats say they sought bipartisan support for the bill, Congressional Republicans argue that they were shut out of the legislative process.We offered 30 amendments when we were in the minority that were swatted away by the majority late into the night, not considered, not adopted, said Representative Peter Roskam, an Illinois Republican on the Ways and Means Committee.Representative Michael C. Burgess, Republican of Texas, said: No governor of either party was involved in the development of this law, even though the administration now says, We want the states to be involved and to be leaders in carrying it out.With the battle over health care still raging, some lawmakers say they now understand what Thomas Jefferson meant when he said, in 1808, that great innovations should not be forced on slender majorities, or enacted without broad support.When Congress created Social Security in 1935 and Medicare in 1965, the majorities in both chambers were larger and more bipartisan than the ones that passed the Affordable Care Act in 2010.The bill coming up in the House on Friday would prohibit enforcement of the health law by the Internal Revenue Service, the agency responsible for imposing penalties on individuals who go without insurance and on employers that fail to offer coverage.Representative Jim McDermott, Democrat of Washington, said one reason Republicans kept voting to repeal or gut the health care law was that they feared it would succeed.What we are hearing right now is the sound of Republican heart rates going up, Mr. McDermott said. Its a frenetic expression of Republican anxiety over the presidents signature legislation working. Washington, Oregon and California are already reporting lower rates for 2014. New York premiums were cut by 50 percent. Sick children are getting covered. The promise we made Americans is being fulfilled, and Republicans see a giant election map slowly losing red blocks.Republicans say that public opinion is on their side. In 2011-12, the House voted more than 30 times to roll back some or all of the law, but Speaker John A. Boehner said that more votes were needed this year because freshman Republicans wanted a chance to go on the record.Republicans were encouraged to see some Democrats voting with them last month. Twenty-two House Democrats joined them in voting to delay a crucial part of the law that requires most people to have insurance, and 35 voted to postpone a requirement that large employers offer coverage to full-time employees.Moreover, Republicans cite concerns about the law expressed by labor unions, including the Teamsters. In a letter last month to the top Democrats in Congress, James P. Hoffa, president of the Teamsters, and two other union presidents said that perverse incentives in the Affordable Care Act were already creating nightmare scenarios. They said that numerous employers have begun to cut workers hours to avoid the cost of providing them health benefits.Marilyn B. Tavenner, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, told Congress on Thursday that she had heard of only isolated incidents in which employers tried to cut back hours. Representative Steve Scalise, Republican of Louisiana, told her that she must be living in some cocoon because he heard of such actions almost every day.Votes to repeal the law are also a way to unite Republicans who cannot agree on other aspects of health policy.Republicans have never, never, never had a comprehensive health care reform plan, said Representative Sander M. Levin of Michigan, the senior Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee.Republicans are sparring among themselves over whether they should try to block all legislation that includes money to carry out the health care law. Some of the most conservative Republicans in Congress say they are prepared to force the issue in debate over a stopgap spending bill, needed to keep the government in operation beyond Sept. 30.Under no circumstances will we support a continuing resolution that funds one penny of Obamacare, said Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas.More experienced Republicans, including Senators John McCain of Arizona and Roy Blunt of Missouri, agree with the goal, but oppose the tactic, fearing that Republicans would be blamed for any government shutdown, as they were in 1995-96.Whatever the reasons for Republicans opposition to the law, it is unlikely that Fridays votes will be their last on the issue.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/19/us/politics/house-gop-to-tie-spending-bill-to-health-law-defunding.html,9/19/13,"WASHINGTON   After three years of cajoling, finessing and occasionally strong-arming his fitful conservative majority, Speaker John A. Boehner waved the white flag on Wednesday, surrendering to demands from his right flank that he tie money to keep the government open after Sept. 30 to stripping President Obamas health care law of any financing.Mr. Boehner knows that the plan he unveiled cannot pass the Senate, and that it may prove unwise politically and economically. His leadership team pressed just last week for an alternative. But with conservative forces uniting against him, he ultimately saw no alternative but to capitulate  and few good options to stop a government shutdown in two weeks.Today was a step forward, and a win for the American people, said Representative Tom Graves, the Georgia Republican whose defund Obamacare push had amassed 80 House supporters, a bloc large enough to dictate the outcome.With much of the government set to run out of money at the end of the month  and run out of borrowing authority by mid-October  Mr. Boehner faced a choice: he could steer a middle ground and find a way out of his fiscal dead end with Republican and Democratic votes, or he could yield to a conservative movement to strip the Affordable Care Act of financing, unite his Republican majority around that war cry, and hope for the best.House conservatives let Mr. Boehner know that any solution that could not attract a majority of the Republican conference could cost him his speakership. Divided Senate Republicans made clear that linking further government spending or a debt ceiling increase to gutting the health care law would never get through the Senate.In March, the speaker himself said: Do you want to risk the full faith and credit of the U.S. government over Obamacare? Thats a very tough argument to make.On Wednesday, the speaker announced his choice.The laws a train wreck, he said. Its time to protect American families from this unworkable law.The Houses stopgap spending measure would finance the government through Dec. 15 at the current spending levels, which reflect the automatic spending cuts that took effect in March, known as sequestration, while blocking the health care law, under which the uninsured will be enrolled beginning on Oct. 1.If the bill clears the House on Friday, Republican leaders could put forward a measure as soon as next week that would raise the governments statutory borrowing limit. That bill would also take aim at the Affordable Care Act, with a one-year delay of its provisions coupled with a one-year increase in the debt ceiling. It would also expedite the construction of the Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada to Louisiana and set a timeline for an overhaul of the federal tax code, and possibly include some other Republican wishes, like specific spending cuts and regulatory changes.For Mr. Boehner, the announcement Wednesday was a humbling moment, and possibly a defining one. Since the Tea Party wave swept Republicans to power in 2010, the beleaguered speaker has often found himself at odds with the most conservative wing of his conference. In late 2011, he famously put his fractious conference on mute as he explained via telephone how it had to give up its opposition to extending a cut in the payroll tax.Three times this year, on major pieces of legislation, the speaker has put what he believed to be the greater needs of his country and his national party over those of his recalcitrant right wing. In January, the House passed legislation to avert huge and sudden tax increases on virtually every American  but let taxes rise on the wealthy  with Democratic votes and a minority of votes by Republicans. The same math passed relief for Hurricane Sandy and a reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act.This time around he was contrite, quoting a plaque that graced the speakers office of Newt Gingrich: Listen, Learn, Help and Lead.The key to any leadership job is to listen, Mr. Boehner said.Mr. Gingrich, of course, was deposed by an angry coup after Republicans lost seats in midterm elections during the second term of the last Democratic president, Bill Clinton. This time, the ground troops simply got their way with Mr. Boehner, providing new evidence that the Tea Party has changed Washington, not the other way around.As has been the case with each fiscal crisis since the Republicans took control of the House, Mr. Boehners decision was an embrace of short-term tactics over long-term strategy. How either the spending or the debt limit measures will become law is anybodys guess.Look, I think you could get all of us in the Senate to support it, Senator John Hoeven, Republican of North Dakota, said of his Senate Republican colleagues. The problem is, what is the Democrat majority going to do with it? Thats the challenge.Even the man who started the defund Obamacare boomlet, Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, seemed to accept Senate reality on Wednesday, putting the onus on House Republicans to stand and fight.Harry Reid will no doubt try to strip the defund language from the continuing resolution, and right now he likely has the votes to do so, Mr. Cruz said. At that point, House Republicans must stand firm.Mr. Obama was visibly irked by the speakers decision. You have never seen in the history of the United States the debt ceiling or the threat of not raising the debt ceiling being used to extort a president or a governing party, and trying to force issues that have nothing to do with the budget and have nothing to do with the debt, he said at the Business Roundtable, which represents the chief executives of the nations largest companies.Even the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a consistent ally of the Republican majority, questioned the Houses course.Democrats were gleeful at the potential political consequences. Representative Steve Israel of New York, the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said House Republicans set off Wednesday on a kamikaze mission, with their speaker in the pilots seat. Theyre living in right-wing fantasy land if they expect Democrats to take the blame for the chaos that could ensue, he said.But victorious House conservatives did their end-zone dance and evinced no worries about the final outcome.Even the best coaches in the N.F.L. only script out the first two series of plays, said Representative Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio, when asked how the speaker would play out the sequence of events. They dont script the whole game. Weve got to play the game. Weve got to see how it all shakes out.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/10/us/politics/business-groups-urge-congress-to-reopen-as-shutdown-drags-on.html,10/10/13,"WASHINGTON   House Republicans, increasingly isolated from even some of their strongest supporters more than a week into a government shutdown, began on Wednesday to consider a path out of the fiscal impasse that would raise the debt ceiling for a few weeks as they press for a broader deficit reduction deal.That approach could possibly set aside the fight over the new health care law, which prompted the shutdown and which some Republicans will be reluctant to abandon.In a meeting with the most ardent House conservatives, Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, laid out a package focused on an overhaul of Medicare and a path toward a comprehensive simplification of the tax code.Were more in the ideas stage right now, said Representative Jack Kingston, Republican of Georgia and a senior member of the Appropriations Committee. There is a developing consensus that this is a lot bigger than an Obamacare discussion.At the same time, Congressional leaders from both parties began some preliminary discussions aimed at reopening the government and raising the statutory borrowing limit. And President Obama, who invited House Democrats on Wednesday, asked all House Republicans to the White House on Thursday, an invitation Speaker John A. Boehner whittled down to a short list of attendees he wants to negotiate a compromise.Democrats showed their own cracks. Twenty-six House Democrats planned to attend a bipartisan event on Thursday morning with the group No Labels, calling for negotiations to start immediately, a challenge to the president and to Democratic leaders who say they will not negotiate until the government reopens and the debt ceiling is lifted.In the meeting with House Democrats on Wednesday evening, Mr. Obama held firm to his stated intention to negotiate with Republicans only after the government is reopened and the debt ceiling is raised. He told Democrats that if he gives in now, Republican demands would be endless. The only thing not on their list is my own resignation, he told Democrats, according to a lawmaker in the room.With the impact of the shutdown starting to intensify, House Republicans were taking criticism from some of their longtime backers. Business groups demanded the immediate reopening of the government, and benefactors like Koch Industries publicly distanced themselves from the shutdown fight.Republicans acknowledged the pressure is mounting on them. On Wednesday, the National Retail Federation joined other reliably Republican business groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers in asking House Republicans to relent.We strongly support passage of both a continuing resolution to provide for funding of the federal government into the next fiscal year and a measure to raise the nations debt ceiling, the National Retail Federations president, Matthew Shay, said in a letter to Congress that pointed out economic indicators showing that the shutdown has already hurt consumer spending and depressed consumer confidence.In the meantime, Koch Industries accused Harry Reid, the Senate majority leader, on Wednesday of spreading false information about the company by suggesting it was behind the move to tie a demand to keep the government open only if financing was eliminated for Mr. Obamas health care law.Koch believes that Obamacare will increase deficits, lead to an overall lowering of the standard of health care and raise taxes, Philip Ellender, the companys chief spokesman, wrote in a letter to senators. However, Koch has not taken a position on the legislative tactic of tying the continuing resolution to defunding Obamacare, nor have we lobbied on legislative programs defunding Obamacare.Mr. Ryans meeting with the conservative Republican Study Committee seemed only to divide its ranks on the most critical issue: whether to set aside the fight over the presidents health care law and focus on long-term deficit reduction. The groups leader, Representative Steve Scalise, Republican of Louisiana, emerged still adamant that any way forward must include a hit to the Affordable Care Act, even if the package focused on entitlement programs  also called mandatory spending.Weve always talked about mandatory spending being addressed in a debt ceiling increase, but keep in mind Obamacare is part of mandatory spending, he said.Other conservatives showed a new flexibility. Representative Mo Brooks, Republican of Alabama and a fierce critic of the health care law, came out of the meeting and said: My primary focus is on minimizing risk of insolvency and bankruptcy. There are many paths you can take to get there.Socialized medicine is just one of the component parts of our debt and deficits that put us at financial risk. Are there paths that can be created that do not include socialized medicine? he asked. Yes.Members suggested they could get behind a lifting of the debt ceiling for several weeks to allow Republicans to unite around a deficit reduction and tax overhaul package.If we cannot get an agreement with the president at some point in time in the next few days, well look at something short term, said Mr. Scalise, echoing a suggestion Mr. Obama floated on Tuesday.But, the congressman said, even that should have spending cuts attached. He also said that a debt-ceiling increase of even three weeks should include a measure passed by the House denying federal subsidies to congressmen, White House officials and their staff members, who already must buy health insurance on the Affordable Care Acts new exchanges. And, he suggested, conservatives might insist on another House bill that would allow the Treasury to borrow enough money to pay off debts as they become due, taking away the threat of a government default.All of those measures would be stiffly resisted by Senate Democrats and the White House.Still, lawmakers did appear to be looking for a way forward after days of simply staring at one another. Ahead of the Wednesday meeting with House Democrats at the White House, Mr. Obama invited all House Republicans to a get-together on Thursday. Mr. Boehner saw a meeting between the president and 232 Republicans as a photo opportunity with no chance of producing substantive discussions. So he reduced the invitation list to 18. That will at least give the appearance of negotiations if it fails to prompt actual substantive talks.Finally, the White House has invited Congressional leaders to talk, Representative Harold Rogers, Republican of Kentucky, said in a statement. I am hopeful the president is serious about finding a deal that results in meaningful spending and entitlement reforms, judiciously extends U.S. government borrowing authority, reopens all federal agencies, and paves the way for the enactment of future appropriations bills so that this lurching from crisis to crisis can be put to an end.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/16/us/politics/as-deadline-looms-boehner-herding-cats-in-bid-for-deal.html,10/16/13,"WASHINGTON   After House Republicans began their closed-door meeting on Tuesday with an impromptu rendition of Amazing Grace, Speaker John A. Boehner stood up with what he hoped would be an equally inspiring message.The Senate was trying to steamroll the House with a new plan to reopen the government and lift the debt ceiling, leaving his team with only two options: We can wait on the Senate for four days and accept whatever they give us, he told them. Or we can go on offense and force their hand.It was yet another moment of decision for Mr. Boehner, who finally finds himself at the crossroads he has been marching toward for weeks: an imminent financial default on the one hand, and on the other an unyielding conservative rank and file that persists with the futile effort to take down President Obamas health care law even if they also take down the speaker in the process.While his colleagues sang about how what once was lost had now been found, Mr. Boehner did not tell them a more dispiriting truth: With less than 48 hours left before the nation is set to exhaust its authority to borrow money, he and his lieutenants were running out ofideas  a fact made starkly evident by the mad and fruitless scramble on Tuesday to come up with ameasure that could win enough support from his members. Around 7 p.m., he sent the House home and canceled all votes for the day.Hes herding cats, said Representative Tom Price, Republican of Georgia.Mr. Boehner initially tried to unite his conference around a plan that had a little bit for everyone. For his hard-line conservative members, Mr. Boehners proposal would have eliminated government contributions for the purchase of health insurance on the new exchanges for lawmakers, White House officials and their staffs, as well as forbidden the Treasury Department to use extraordinary measures to extend its borrowing capabilities. For his more moderate members, Mr. Boehner offered a simple appeal  his plan would have reopened the government through Dec. 15, and extended the nations borrowing authority through Feb. 7.But conservatives and their advocacy groups balked, and Mr. Boehner was forced to set his plan aside.This is about as challenging as it can be, in terms of trying to figure out where the effective agreement is going to be to move forward and how do you get to that point where everybody looks at that and says, Well, that isnt everything but thats a reasonable way forward, said David Winston, a Republican strategist and close adviser to Mr. Boehner.Almost every day since the government shutdown began on Oct. 1, Mr. Boehner and his besieged band of House Republicans have trotted out a new gambit to try to outmaneuver Senate Democrats and the president. The public was upset over closed national monuments? Pass legislation reopening them. Vital health and safety services had no staff to carry out their functions? Appropriate money to finance them.All the while, Mr. Boehner, of Ohio, tended carefully to the members of his fractious conference. He joined them Friday night for P. F. Changs Chinese takeout in the Capitol. After an appearance on the Sunday talk shows, he shopped at his local Harris Teeter and invited some lawmakers to his Capitol Hill town house for burgers, manning the grill himself. He assumed the role of battlefield commander, admonishing the president in public in the sternest of terms.Mr. Boehner has also sought solace in his routines. He still takes long walks in the morning before heading to his office in the Capitol, and often eats breakfast alone at the counter of Petes Diner not far from his house. This month, shortly after the shutdown began, Mr. Boehner huddled in his Capitol suite with a group of allies and loyal members  Representatives Tom Cole of Oklahoma, John Kline of Minnesota and Pat Tiberi of Ohio, among others  known as Team Boehner.The strategy has largely worked, so far satisfying the most unmanageable of Mr. Boehners restive conservative members. But the next 48 hours may prove the biggest test of Mr. Boehners career and determine his future at the top of House Republicans. Its tough, said Senator Saxby Chambliss, the Georgia Republican who is one of the speakers closest friends in Congress. Trying to find 218 votes is never easy. But right now, its harder than ever.Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, who as a House member in the late 1990s was part of a successful coup to unseat Speaker Newt Gingrich, described Mr. Boehners tenuous state more bluntly, worrying aloud that if Mr. Boehner is unable to pass some proposal out of the House, the speaker may find himself in a compromised situation.I was involved in taking one speaker down, Mr. Graham said. Id like to be involved in keeping this speaker, because quite frankly I think he deserves it.A major source of Mr. Boehners limitations as speaker is simple math. Republicans control 232 seats, and 218 are required for a majority when there are no vacancies, meaning that in most instances, he can afford to lose only 14 Republican votes. For much of the 113th Congress, that has meant that the only bills guaranteed to pass are simple, nonpartisan matters like renaming a federal building or ones that strongly reflect conservative policies like the ban on abortion 20 weeks after fertilization.Because Mr. Boehner can almost never guarantee Senate leaders that his conference will vote with him, he has greatly diminished bargaining power in the current fight as his members pass one dead-end bill after another. Theres a silent majority in the conference, said Representative Devin Nunes, Republican of California. We have too many guys who dont understand that without 218 you have no leverage. At the end of the day, thats the problem.That has not stopped Mr. Boehner from trying. He has been in near constant contact with Republican leaders in the Senate, who have conveyed to Mr. Boehner what they believe their moderate Democratic counterparts might be willing to accept. He has also been carefully soliciting the views of his own members, bringing in at least two small groups of moderate legislators for private meetings, and buttonholing other colleagues on the House floor and in the cloakroom.He is a really good listener, said Representative James Lankford of Oklahoma, the chairman of the House Republican Policy Committee. So hes constantly trying to figure out, is this one person or is this a group that thinks this? And how large is that group? I just think he has a really unique skill of being able to hear people and where they are.Mr. Boehner may be unable to corral his maverick members, but they still rely on him heavily to bring in money for their re-elections: On Tuesday, in a telling reminder of his big-dollar prowess, Mr. Boehners campaign committee filed its third-quarter fund-raising report.Boehner-affiliated committees transferred $4.1 million to the National Republican Congressional Committee during the third quarter, making him its largest source of member money, by far.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
14,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/26/us/politics/cruz-takes-his-stand-on-the-road-to-iowa.html,10/26/13,"DES MOINES   Senator Ted Cruz, the Texas Republican who has left senior members of his party worried about the political fallout from the federal government shutdown, argued here Friday that the battle over the health care law would invigorate Republicans in next years elections.For everyone who talks about wanting to win elections in 2014  particularly an off-year, nonpresidential year  nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing matters more than an energized and active and vocal grass-roots America, Mr. Cruz told about 600 Iowa Republicans at a party fund-raising dinner.The first-year senator, the face of the Congressional hard-liners who sought to link defunding the Affordable Care Act with financing the government, dismissed media attention on Republican infighting but said his party was not able to accomplish its goal during the budget fight because of internal divisions.We didnt because a significant number of Senate Republicans chose not to unite and stand side by side with House Republicans, said Mr. Cruz, drawing boos.The senator, making his third Iowa trip this year, made no direct mention of running for president in the state that begins the nominating process, but repeatedly mentioned Charles E. Grassley, the states Republican senator, and said they had worked together on gun legislation earlier this year.Repeatedly attacking official Washington in a 45-minute speech, Mr. Cruz jokingly asked what dumping every Washington strategist in the ocean would be called.A good start, he cracked.But the dinner here illustrated that the internal Republican strife was hardly limited to politicians and strategists in the nations capital. The Iowa state party has been taken over by the insurgent conservative wing, something made abundantly clear before Mr. Cruz took the stage.A number of state party officials began the dinner by criticizing the establishment wing of the party  or the old guard, as David Fischer, the Iowa Republican co-chairman, called it.Noting that some such mainline Republicans do not approve of the likes of Mr. Cruz and other young movement conservatives and even call them names, Mr. Fischer shot back: I have a name for these principled leaders, too: I call them the future.Another Iowa Republican official, the national committee member Steve Scheffler, asked in a prayer before the meal for more conservatives willing to be crucified for their belief system.Gov. Terry E. Branstad of Iowa, who comes from the establishment wing, offered strikingly different remarks: he fleetingly welcomed Mr. Cruz to the state and then hailed the efforts of Republican governors around the country, including some of Mr. Cruzs potential 2016 rivals.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
15,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/01/opinion/are-liberals-fundraising-hypocrites.html,10/1/14,"Lets imagine that Republicans swept the 2012 elections and were now in control not merely of the House but of the presidency and the Senate, too.Now lets take it one step further and say that by using the filibuster the Democratic minority in the Senate had successfully blocked President Romneys appointments to federal district and appellate court judgeships.What if, faced with this Democratic intransigence, the conservative Federalist Society helped devise a strategy to revamp Senate rules to eliminate the filibuster so that judicial nominees could be confirmed by a simple majority instead of the 60 votes required to overcome a filibuster?The elimination of the filibuster has allowed President Romney to appoint three judges to the critically important United States Court of Appeals, District of Columbia Circuit, establishing a decisive 7 to 4 conservative majority on that bench. Whats more, two of the the three judges newly appointed by President Romney are members of the Federalist Society and the new conservative majority on the D.C. Circuit is now positioned to rule Obamacare unconstitutional.The Koch brothers  recall we are still in an alt-hypothetical universe  reward the Federalist Society by directing 100 loyal billionaires to contribute to the group.Would these developments provoke liberal outrage?They certainly would.But its not only the right that uses secretive organizations to keep rich donors anonymous while it seeks to influence elections and policy. Liberals do the same, and the press in large part gives them a pass.As you no doubt realized while you were reading, the hypothetical described above did not take place, but something approximating it did. Instead of Republican offenders, the players were President Obama, a Democratic Senate, the progressive American Constitution Society, and the Democracy Alliance, a network of very wealthy liberal donors.Heres what the Democratic Party and its allies actually did. The American Constitution Society  the left counterpart to the Federalist Society  helped lay the intellectual groundwork for Senate Democrats to put an end to filibusters of judicial nominees.The elimination of judicial filibusters in November 2013 allowed Democrats to approve, by simple majority, three of Obamas appointees to the United States Court of Appeals, D.C. Circuit, giving liberals a 7-4 majority.Because of the administrative law and national security cases it hears, the D.C. Circuit is considered the second most important court in the nation.The significance of the confirmation of three new Democratic appointees to the court became apparent in July, when a three-judge panel of the court ruled 2-1 in Halbig v. Burwell that residents of the 36 states that use the federal health care exchange were ineligible for subsidized insurance under Obamacare. The panels decision appeared to be a potentially crippling blow to the Affordable Care Act. The two judges in the majority on the panel were appointed by Republican presidents, the dissenter by a Democrat.On Sept. 4, however, the full Circuit Court of Appeals decided to set aside the three-judge panel decision and rehear the case en banc  that is, with all 11 judges, a majority of whom are now Democratic appointees.Has there been an outcry about Democratic court packing? Only in a right-wing online publication, the Washington Free Beacon, Democracy Alliance Bankrolled Court-Packing Scheme, and on the conservative website Breitbart.com, Exclusive - Leftist Money, Harry Reid Trying to Hijack Sanctity of the Independent Federal Judiciary. But the story does not end there. Conservatives claim that the Democracy Alliance is at the core of a liberal conspiracy.Mark Holden, general counsel at Koch Industries, contends that the Democracy Alliance orchestrates the activities of a permanent left infrastructure with ties to 172 organizations, each determined to attack the Koch brothers agenda of free enterprise and democratic capitalism.In a speech he gave to a closed meeting of conservative donors in Dana Point, Calif., on June 16, The Opposition: Understanding Their Strategy and Infrastructure, Holden, speaking about liberal organizations, argued thatThe Koch organization network is well known for its secretiveness. Holden suggested that their [Democracy Alliance] bottom line is not that different than ours, but in some ways theyre much better at it.A tape and transcript of Holdens speech were released by the left-leaning website Lady Libertine which, by its own account, seeks to unite the disenfranchised and resurrect the American Dream. Holden confirmed its veracity in an email to The Huffington Post.Despite Holdens argument that the liberal and conservative dark money networks are equivalent, there are substantial differences between them.The Democracy Alliance is an organization of roughly 100 very rich men and women who agree to contribute at least $200,000 annually to a list of roughly 20 liberal think tanks and advocacy groups, according to documents obtained by Politico. The Alliance itself makes no contributions. Nor does it pay for television ads or engage in other direct campaign activity.In effect, the Alliance helps guide an estimated $30 million a year. It does not disclose its members or the groups that are recipients of its members contributions, although a substantial amount of information has been gleaned by enterprising reporters.The projected total budgets of the endorsed organizations for 2014, according to the documents, are $189.2 million, of which the $30 million from Democracy Alliance partners would amount to nearly 15 percent.The Alliance does not claim tax-exempt status.In contrast, the Koch network is overwhelmingly made up of tax-exempt organizations claiming either 501(c)4 or 501(c)6 exempt status. Many of the Koch organizations spend money on political ads. The Center for Responsive Politics and the Washington Post estimated that in the 2011-12 election cycle, the Koch network of political, tax-exempt nonprofits raised at least $400 million.Gara LaMarche, the president of Democracy Alliance, defended his members, who have been accused of hypocrisy. The charge, coming from both the left and right, LaMarche wrote, centers on the assertion that progressive wealthy donors are spending a lot of money in elections when they also claim to be for getting money out of elections.LaMarche countered in an email thatIn contrast, political spending by the Kochs and their alliesDavid Brock, the chairman of Media Matters, which is one of the groups endorsed by the Alliance, made a similar argument at a Democracy Alliance meeting in Santa Fe in June:Brock and LaMarches argument is politically risky. Claiming the moral high ground to assert that you can do something that your morally crippled adversaries cannot is one of the more effective strategies to alienate people.Liberals are not alone in the gravity of their claims. Officials of Koch Industries contend there have been death threats against the Kochs and threats against our facilities. They like to cite a 1958 Supreme Court decision, N.A.A.C.P. v. Alabama, in which the court unanimously backed the N.A.A.C.P.s refusal to turn over its membership list to the Alabama Attorney General on the basis that release of the names would put the lives of N.A.A.C.P. members in danger.The leadership of the Democracy Alliance is now queasy about its policies on anonymous donations. The Koch organizations remain adamant in their refusal to disclose donors.In a series of emails and phone conversations, LaMarche said that he is pressing members of the Alliance to be more open. He would like, for example, to list the names of those willing to give up their privacy. He also said that he expects the Alliance to adopt a policy of releasing the names of the organizations to which it recommends its members make contributions.The more transparent we can be, the better. Progressive values are much more in line with transparency, LaMarche said during our conversation.Koch officials declined to answer my question, Is transparency a good thing in democratic politics?Political spending by dark money groups that do not disclose donors is on track to break all previous records. By some calculations, such spending accounts for more than half the media outlay by outside organizations in current House and Senate races.Robert Maguire, who set up the Politically Active Nonprofits Project at the Center for Responsive Politics, reported on Sept. 4 that dark money organizations have already dropped $68 million on air time alone in Senate and House races, making up 56 percent of all the spending by independent expenditure groups.Publications like Mother Jones are warning that the 2014 elections will be the start of a Dark-Money Apocalypse. If recent Supreme Court rulings stand and the Federal Election Commission continue to refuse to regulate political groups that do not disclose contributors, dark money spending will at some point in the not-too-distant future become the single most important source of election cash in the key battleground contests that determine which party controls the House and Senate. This is already the case for some Republican candidates in tight contests.In the North Carolina Senate race, for example, Thom Tillis, the Republican challenger, has so far spent $3.23 million. Conservative dark money groups have invested twice that, $6.7 million, in his candidacy. Kay Hagen, the incumbent Democrat, has raised $7.96 million, and liberal dark money groups have spent $2.1 million.The Center for Responsive Politics has demonstrated that in the top eight 2014 Senate races, dark money tilts decisively to the right: $28 million spent by conservative groups, $12.3 million by liberal organizations.In the long run, the relatively modest (but growing) dependence of Democrats on dark money, mega-dollar contributors to super PACs and other funding mechanisms is corrupting, even as it comes alongside the partys parallel success in building a powerful small donor base. On issues of taxes, regulation, spending and campaign finance, the Republican Party has established itself as the advocate of the wealthiest Americans. Insofar as the Democratic Party moves in the same direction, it will be unable to act as a counterbalance to the right.While neither the left nor the right has clean hands, liberals have far more to lose, and much less to gain, from continued hypocrisy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/21/us/politics/obamas-state-of-the-union-2015-address.html,1/21/15,"Following is the transcript of President Obamas State of the Union address, as transcribed by the Federal News Service.PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you so much, please. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of Congress, my fellow Americans.We are 15 years into this new century, 15 years that dawned with terror touching our shores; that unfolded with a new generation fighting two long and costly wars; that saw a vicious recession spread across our nation and the world. It has been, and still is, a hard time for many. But tonight, we turn the page.Tonight, after a breakthrough year for America, our economy is growing and creating jobs at the fastest pace since 1999. (Applause.) Our unemployment rate is now lower than it was before the financial crisis. More of our kids are graduating than ever before; more of our people are insured than ever before  (applause)  and we are as free from the grip of foreign oil as weve been in almost 30 years. (Applause.)Tonight, for the first time since 9/11, our combat mission in Afghanistan is over. Six years ago, nearly 180,000 American troops served in Iraq and Afghanistan. Today, fewer than 15,000 remain. And we salute the courage and sacrifice of every man and woman in this 9/11 Generation who has served to keep us safe. We are humbled and grateful for your service. (Applause.)America, for all that weve endured, for all the grit and hard work required to come back, for all the tasks that lie ahead, know this: The shadow of crisis has passed, and the State of the Union is strong. (Applause.)At this moment, with a growing economy, shrinking deficits, bustling industry, booming energy production, we have risen from recession freer to write our own future than any other nation on Earth. Its now up to us to choose who we want to be over the next 15 years, and for decades to come.Will we accept an economy where only a few of us do spectacularly well? Or will we commit ourselves to an economy that generates rising incomes and chances for everyone who makes the effort? (Applause.)Will we approach the world fearful and reactive, dragged into costly conflicts that strain our military and set back our standing? Or will we lead wisely, using all elements of our power to defeat new threats and protect our planet?Will we allow ourselves to be sorted into factions and turned against one another, or will we recapture the sense of common purpose that has always propelled America forward?In two weeks, I will send this Congress a budget filled with ideas that are practical, not partisan. And in the months ahead, Ill crisscross the country making a case for those ideas.So tonight, I want to focus less on a checklist of proposals, and focus more on the values at stake in the choices before us.It begins with our economy.Seven years ago, Rebekah and Ben Erler of Minneapolis were newlyweds. She waited tables. He worked construction. Their first child, Jack, was on the way. They were young and in love in America, and it doesnt get much better than that.If only we had known, Rebekah wrote to me last spring, what was about to happen to the housing and construction market.As the crisis worsened, Bens business dried up, so he took what jobs he could find, even if they kept him on the road for long stretches of time.Rebekah took out student loans and enrolled in community college and retrained for a new career.They sacrificed for each other, and slowly, it paid off. They bought their first home. They had a second son, Henry. Rebekah got a better job, and then a raise. Bens back in construction and home for dinner every night.It is amazing, Rebekah wrote, what you can bounce back from when you have to. We are a strong, tight-knit family who has made it through some very, hard times.We are a strong, tight-knit family who has made it through some very, hard times.America, Rebekah and Bens story is our story. They represent the millions whove worked hard and scrimped and sacrificed and retooled.You are the reason that I ran for this office. You are the people I was thinking of six years ago today in the darkest months of the crisis when I stood on the steps of this Capitol and promised we would rebuild our economy on a new foundation. And it has been your resilience, your effort that has made it possible for our country to emerge stronger.We believed we could reverse the tide of outsourcing, and draw new jobs to our shores. And over the past five years, our businesses have created more than 11 million new jobs. (Applause.)We believed we could reduce our dependence on foreign oil and protect our planet. And today, America is number one in oil and gas. America is number one in wind power. Every three weeks, we bring online as much solar power as we did in all of 2008. (Applause.)And thanks to lower gas prices and higher fuel standards, the typical family this year should save about $750 at the pump. (Applause.)We believed we could prepare our kids for a more competitive world. And today, our younger students have earned the highest math and reading scores on record. Our high school graduation rate has hit an all-time high. More Americans finish college than ever before. (Applause.We believed that sensible regulations could prevent another crisis, shield families from ruin, and encourage fair competition.Today, we have new tools to stop taxpayer-funded bailouts, and a new consumer watchdog to protect us from predatory lending and abusive credit card practices. And in the past year alone, about ten million uninsured Americans finally gained the security of health coverage. (Applause.)At every step, we were told our goals were misguided or too ambitious, that we would crush jobs and explode deficits. Instead, weve seen the fastest economic growth in over a decade, our deficits cut by two thirds, a stock market that has doubled and health care inflation at its lowest rate in 50 years. (Applause.)This is good news, people. (Laughter.) So  (applause) -- so the verdict is clear. Middle-class economics works, expanding opportunity works, and these policies will continue to work as long as politics dont get in the way.We cant slow down businesses or put our economy at risk with government shutdowns or fiscal showdowns. We cant put the security of families at risk by taking away their health insurance or unraveling the new rules on Wall Street or refighting past battles on immigration when weve got to fix a broken system.And if a bill comes to my desk that tries to do any of these things, it will veto it. It will have earned my veto. (Applause.)Today, thanks to a growing economy, the recovery is touching more and more lives. Wages are finally starting to rise again. We know that more small-business owners plan to raise their employees pay than at any time since 2007.But heres the thing. Those of us here tonight, we need to set our sights higher than just making sure government doesnt screw things up, the government doesnt halt the progress were making. We need to do more than just do no harm.Tonight, together, lets do more to restore the link between hard work and growing opportunity for every American. (Applause.)Because families like Rebekahs still need our help. She and Ben are working as hard as ever, but theyve had to forego vacations and a new car so that they can pay off student loans and save for retirement. Friday night pizza, thats a big splurge. Basic child care for Jack and Henry costs more than their mortgage, and almost as much as a year at the University of Minnesota.Like millions of hardworking Americans, Rebekah isnt asking for a handout, but she is asking that we look for more ways to help families get ahead.And in fact, at every moment of economic change throughout our history, this country has taken bold action to adapt to new circumstances and to make sure everyone gets a fair shot.We set up worker protections, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid to protect ourselves from the harshest adversity. We gave our citizens schools and colleges, infrastructure and the Internet, tools they needed to go as far as their efforts and their dreams will take them.Thats what middle-class economics is: the idea that this country does best when everyone gets their fair shot, everyone does their fair share, everyone plays by the same set of rules. (Applause.) We dont just want everyone to share in Americas success; we want everyone to contribute to our success. (Applause.)So -- so what does middle-class economics require in our time?First, middle-class economics means helping working families feel more secure in a world of constant change. That means helping folks afford child care, college, health care, a home, retirement, and my budget will address each of these issues, lowering the taxes of working families and putting thousands of dollars back into their pockets each year. (Applause.)Heres one example: During World War II, when men like my grandfather went off to war, having women like my grandmother in the work force was a national security priority. So this country provided universal child care.In todays economy, when having both parents in the work force is an economic necessity for many families, we need affordable, high-quality child care more than ever. (Applause.)Its not a nice-to-have: its a must-have. So its time we stop treating child care as a side issue, or a womens issue, and treat it like the national economic priority that it is for all of us. (Applause.)And thats why my plan will make quality child care more available, and more affordable, for every middle-class and low-income family with young children in America, by creating more slots and a new tax cut of up to $3,000 per child, per year. (Applause.)Heres another example. Today, we are the only advanced country on Earth that doesnt guarantee paid sick leave or paid maternity leave to our workers. 43 million workers have no paid sick leave. 43 million. Think about that.And that forces too many parents to make the gut-wrenching choice between a paycheck and a sick kid at home. So Ill be taking new action to help states adopt paid leave laws of their own. And since paid sick leave won where it was on the ballot last November, lets put it to a vote right here in Washington. (Applause.) Send me a bill that gives every worker in America the opportunity to earn seven days of paid sick leave.Its the right thing to do. (Applause.)Of course, nothing helps families make ends meet like higher wages. Thats why this Congress still needs to pass a law that makes sure a woman is paid the same as a man for doing the same work. (Applause.) Its 2015. Its time. We still need to make sure employees get the overtime theyve earned -- (applause) -- and everyone in this Congress who still refuses to raise the minimum wage, I say this: If you truly believe you could work full-time and support a family on less than $15,000 a year, try it. (Laughter.) If not, vote to give millions of the hardest-working people in America a raise. (Applause.)These ideas wont make everybody rich, wont relieve every hardship. Thats not the job of government.To give working families a fair shot, we still need more employers to see beyond next quarters earnings and recognize that investing in their work force is in their companys long-term interest.We still need laws that strengthen rather than weaken unions, and give American workers a voice. (Applause.)But -- but you know, things like child care and sick leave and equal pay, things like lower mortgage premiums and a higher minimum wage, these ideas will make a meaningful difference in the lives of millions of families. Thats a fact. And thats what all of us, Republicans and Democrats alike, were sent here to do.Second, to make sure folks keep earning higher wages down the road, we have to do more to help Americans upgrade their skills. (Applause.)Now America thrived in the 20th century because we made high school free, sent a generation of G.I.s to college, trained the best work force in the world. We were ahead of the curve. But other countries caught on. And in a 21st century economy that rewards knowledge like never before, we need to up our game. We need to do more.By the end of this decade, two in three job openings will require some higher education. Two in three. And yet, we still live in a country where too many bright, striving Americans are priced out of the education they need. Its not fair to them, and its sure not smart for our future. Thats why I am sending this Congress a bold new plan to lower the cost of community college to zero. (Applause.)Keep in mind, 40 percent of our college students choose community college. Some are young and starting out. Some are older and looking for a better job. Some are veterans and single parents trying to transition back into the job market.Whoever you are, this plan is your chance to graduate ready for the new economy, without a load of debt. Understand, youve got to earn it. Youve got to keep your grades up and graduate on time.Tennessee, a state with Republican leadership, and Chicago, a city with Democratic leadership, are showing that free community college is possible. I want to spread that idea all across America so that two years of college becomes as free and universal in America as high school is today. (Applause.) Lets stay ahead of the curve.And -- and I want to work with this Congress to make sure Americans already burdened with student loans can reduce their monthly payments so that student debt doesnt derail anyones dreams. (Applause.)Thanks to Vice President Bidens great work to update our job training system, were connecting community colleges with local employers to train workers to fill high-paying jobs like coding and nursing and robotics.Tonight, Im also asking more businesses to follow the lead of companies like CVS and UPS and offer more educational benefits and paid apprenticeships, opportunities that give workers the chance to earn higher-paying jobs, even if they dont have a higher education.And as a new generation of veterans comes home, we owe them every opportunity to live the American Dream they helped defend.Already, weve made strides towards ensuring that every veteran has access to the highest quality care, were slashing the backlog that had too many veterans waiting years to get the benefits they need, and were making it easier for vets to translate their training and experience into civilian jobs.And joining forces, the national campaign launched by Michelle and Jill Biden -- (applause) -- thank you, Michelle, thank you, Jill -- has helped nearly 700,000 veterans and military spouses get a new job. (Applause.)So to every C.E.O. in America, let me repeat: If you want somebody whos going to get the job done, and done right, hire a veteran. (Applause.)Finally, as we better train our workers, we need the new economy to keep churning out high-wage jobs for our workers to fill. Since 2010, America has put more people back to work than Europe, Japan, and all advanced economies combined. (Applause.)Our manufacturers have added almost 800,000 new jobs. Some of our bedrock sectors, like our auto industry, are booming. But there are also millions of Americans who work in jobs that didnt even exist 10 or 20 years ago: jobs at companies like Google, and eBay, and Tesla.So no one knows for certain which industries will generate the jobs of the future. But we do know we want them here in America. (Applause.) We know that.Thats why the third part of middle-class economics is all about building the most competitive economy anywhere, the place where businesses want to locate and hire.Twenty-first-century businesses need 21st-century infrastructure: modern ports, and stronger bridges, faster trains and the fastest Internet. (Applause.)Democrats and Republicans used to agree on this. So lets set our sights higher than a single oil pipeline; lets pass a bipartisan -- (applause) -- infrastructure plan that could create more than 30 times as many jobs per year and make this country stronger for decades to come.Lets do it. Lets get it done. (Applause.) Lets get it done.Twenty-first-century businesses, including small businesses, need to sell more American products overseas. Today, our businesses export more than ever, and exporters tend to pay their workers higher wages.But as we speak, China wants to write the rules for the worlds fastest-growing region. That would put our workers and our businesses at a disadvantage.Why would we let that happen? We should write those rules. We should level the playing field.Thats why Im asking both parties to give me trade promotion authority to protect American workers with strong new trade deals from Asia to Europe -- (applause) -- that arent just free but are also fair. Its the right thing to do.Look, Im -- Im the first one to admit -- Im the first one to admit that past trade deals havent always lived up to the hype, and thats why weve gone after countries  (applause) -- that break the rules at our expense. But 95 percent of the worlds customers live outside our borders. We cant close ourselves off from those opportunities. More than half of manufacturing executives have said theyre actively looking to bring jobs back from China. So lets give them one more reason to get it done.Twenty-first-century businesses will rely on American science and technology, research and development. I want the country that eliminated polio and mapped the human genome to lead a new era of medicine: one that delivers the right treatment at the right time. (Applause.)In some patients with cystic fibrosis, this approach has reversed a disease once thought unstoppable. Tonight, Im launching a new Precision Medicine Initiative to bring us closer to curing diseases like cancer and diabetes and to give all of us access to the personalized information we need to keep ourselves and our families healthier. We can do this. (Applause.)I intend to protect a free and open Internet, to extend its reach to every classroom, and every community -- (applause) -- and help folks build the fastest networks, so that the next generation of digital innovators and entrepreneurs have the platform to keep reshaping our world.I want Americans to win the race for the kinds of discoveries that unleash new jobs: converting sunlight into liquid fuel; creating revolutionary prosthetics, so that a veteran who gave his arms for his country can play catch with his kids again. (Applause.)Pushing out into the solar system not just to visit, but to stay. Last month, we launched a new spacecraft as part of a re-energized space program that will send American astronauts to Mars. And in two months, to prepare us for those missions, Scott Kelly will begin a yearlong stay in space. So good luck, Captain. (Applause.) Make sure to Instagram it. Were proud of you.Now, the truth is when it comes to issues like infrastructure and basic research, I know theres bipartisan support in this chamber. Members of both parties have told me so.Where we too often run onto the rocks is how to pay for these investments. As Americans, we dont mind paying our fair share of taxes, as long as everybody else does too.But for far too long, lobbyists have rigged the tax code with loopholes that let some corporations pay nothing while others pay full freight. Theyve riddled it with giveaways that the super rich dont need, while denying a break to middle-class families who do.This year, we have an opportunity to change that. Lets close loopholes so we stop rewarding companies that keep profits abroad, and reward those that invest in America. (Applause.) Lets use those savings to rebuild our infrastructure and make it more attractive for companies to bring jobs home. Lets simplify the system and let a small-business owner file based on her actual bank statement instead of the number of accountants she can afford. (Applause.)And lets close the loopholes that lead to inequality by allowing the top one percent to avoid paying taxes on their accumulated wealth. We can use that money to help more families pay for child care and send their kids to college. We need a tax code that truly helps working Americans trying to get a leg up in the new economy, and we can achieve that together. (Applause.) We can achieve it together.Helping hardworking families make ends meet. Giving them the tools they need for good-paying jobs in this new economy. Maintaining the conditions of growth and competitiveness. This is where America needs to go. I believe its where the American people want to go. It will make our economy stronger a year from now, 15 years from now, and deep into the century ahead.Of course, if theres one thing this new century has taught us, its that we cannot separate our work at home from challenges beyond our shores.My first duty as Commander-in-Chief is to defend the United States of America. In doing so, the question is not -- in doing so the question is not whether America leads in the world, but how.When we make rash decisions, reacting to the headlines instead of using our heads; when the first response to a challenge is to send in our military, then we risk getting drawn into unnecessary conflicts, and neglect the broader strategy we need for a safer, more prosperous world. Thats what our enemies want us to do.I believe in a smarter kind of American leadership. We lead best when we combine military power with strong diplomacy; when we leverage our power with coalition building; when we dont let our fears blind us to the opportunities that this new century presents.Thats exactly what were doing right now, and around the globe, it is making a difference.First, we stand united with people around the world whove been targeted by terrorists, from a school in Pakistan to the streets of Paris.We will continue  (applause) -- to hunt down terrorists and dismantle their networks, and we reserve the right to act unilaterally, as we have done relentlessly since I took office, to take out terrorists who pose a direct threat to us and our allies. (Applause.)At the same time, weve learned some costly lessons over the last 13 years. Instead of Americans patrolling the valleys of Afghanistan, weve trained their security forces, whove now taken the lead, and weve honored our troops sacrifice by supporting that countrys first democratic transition.Instead of sending large ground forces overseas, were partnering with nations from South Asia to North Africa to deny safe haven to terrorists who threaten America.In Iraq and Syria, American leadership, including our military power, is stopping ISILs advance. Instead of getting dragged into another ground war in the Middle East, we are leading a broad coalition, including Arab nations, to degrade and ultimately destroy this terrorist group. (Applause.)Were also supporting a moderate opposition in Syria that can help us in this effort and assisting people everywhere who stand up to the bankrupt ideology of violent extremism.Now, this effort will take time. It will require focus. But we will succeed. And tonight, I call on this Congress to show the world that we are united in this mission by passing a resolution to authorize the use of force against ISIL. (Applause.) We need that authority.Second, we are demonstrating the power of American strength and diplomacy. Were upholding the principle that bigger nations cant bully the small by opposing Russian aggression and supporting Ukraines democracy, and reassuring our NATO allies. (Applause.)Last year, as we were doing the hard work of imposing sanctions along with our allies, as we were reinforcing our presence with the frontline states, Mr. Putins aggression, it was suggested, was a masterful display of strategy and strength. Thats what I heard from some folks. Well, today, it is America that stands strong and united with our allies, while Russia is isolated, with its economy in tatters. Thats how America leads: not with bluster, but with persistent, steady resolve. (Applause.)In Cuba, we are ending a policy  (applause) -- that was long past its expiration date. When what youre doing doesnt work for 50 years, its time to try something new. (Applause.) And our shift in Cuba policy has the potential to end a legacy of mistrust in our hemisphere and removes the phony excuse for restrictions in Cuba, stands up for democratic values and extends the hand of friendship to the Cuban people. And this year, Congress should begin the work of ending the embargo. (Applause.)As -- as His Holiness, Pope Francis, has said, diplomacy is the work of small steps. These small steps have added up to new hope for the future in Cuba. And after years in prison, we are overjoyed that Alan Gross is back where he belongs. (Applause.) Welcome home, Alan. Were glad youre here.Our diplomacy is at work with respect to Iran, where, for the first time in a decade, weve halted the progress of its nuclear program and reduced its stockpile of nuclear material.Between now and this spring, we have a chance to negotiate a comprehensive agreement that prevents a nuclear-armed Iran, secures America and our allies, including Israel, while avoiding yet another Middle East conflict.Therere no guarantees that negotiations will succeed, and I keep all options on the table to prevent a nuclear Iran. But new sanctions passed by this Congress at this moment in time will all but guarantee that diplomacy fails, alienating America from its allies, making it harder to maintain sanctions and ensuring that Iran starts up its nuclear program again. It doesnt make sense. That is why I will veto any new sanctions bill that threatens to undo this progress. (Applause.) The American people expect us to only go to war as a last resort, and I intend to stay true to that wisdom.Third, were looking beyond the issues that have consumed us in the past to shape the coming century.No foreign nation, no hacker, should be able to shut down our networks, steal our trade secrets, or invade the privacy of American families, especially our kids. (Applause.)But we are making sure our government integrates intelligence to combat cyber threats, just as we have done to combat terrorism. And tonight, I urge this Congress to finally pass the legislation we need to better meet the evolving threat of cyberattacks, combat identity theft, and protect our childrens information. That should be a bipartisan effort. (Applause.)You know, if we dont act, well leave our nation and our economy vulnerable. If we do, we can continue to protect the technologies that have unleashed untold opportunities for people around the globe.In West Africa, our troops, our scientists, our doctors, our nurses and health care workers are rolling back Ebola, saving countless lives and stopping the spread of disease. (Applause.) I could not be prouder of them, and I thank this Congress for your bipartisan support of their efforts.But the job is not yet done, and the world needs to use this lesson to build a more effective global effort to prevent the spread of future pandemics, invest in smart development and eradicate extreme poverty.In the Asia Pacific, we are modernizing alliances while making sure that other nations play by the rules in how they trade, how they resolve maritime disputes, how they participate in meeting common international challenges like nonproliferation and disaster relief. And no challenge, no challenge, poses a greater threat to future generations than climate change. (Applause.) 2014 was the planets warmest year on record.Now, one year doesnt make a trend, but this does: 14 of the 15 warmest years on record have all fallen in the first 15 years of this century.Ive heard some folks try to dodge the evidence by saying theyre not scientists, that we dont have enough information to act. Well, Im not a scientist either. But you know what? I know a lot of really good scientists at NASA and at NOAA and at our major universities, and the best scientists in the world are all telling us that our activities are changing the climate, and if we dont act forcefully, well continue to see rising oceans, longer, hotter heat waves, dangerous droughts and floods, and massive disruptions that can trigger greater migration and conflict and hunger around the globe. The Pentagon says that climate change poses immediate risks to our national security. We should act like it. (Applause.)Thats why, over the past six years, weve done more than ever to combat climate change, from the way we produce energy, to the way we use it. Thats why weve set aside more public lands and waters than any administration in history. And thats why I will not let this Congress endanger the health of our children by turning back the clock on our efforts. I am determined to make sure American leadership drives international action. (Applause.)In Beijing, we made a historic announcement: the United States will double the pace at which we cut carbon pollution, and China committed, for the first time, to limiting their emissions. And because the worlds two largest economies came together, other nations are now stepping up, and offering hope that, this year, the world will finally reach an agreement to protect the one planet weve got.And Theres one last pillar of our leadership, and thats the example of our values.As Americans, we respect human dignity, even when were threatened, which is why Ive prohibited torture, and worked to make sure our use of new technology like drones is properly constrained. (Applause.) Its why we speak out against the deplorable anti-Semitism that has resurfaced in certain parts of the world. (Applause.)Its why we continue to reject offensive stereotypes of Muslims, the vast majority of whom share our commitment to peace. Thats why we defend free speech and advocate for political prisoners and condemn the persecution of women or religious minorities or people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender. We do these things not only because they are the right thing to do -- (applause) -- but because ultimately, they make us safer.As Americans, we have a profound commitment to justice. So it makes no sense to spend $3 million per prisoner to keep open a prison that the world condemns and terrorists use to recruit. (Applause.)Since Ive been president, weve worked responsibly to cut the population of Gitmo in half. Now it is time to finish the job, and I will not relent in my determination to shut it down. It is not who we are. (Applause.) Its time to close Gitmo.As Americans, we cherish our civil liberties, and we need to uphold that commitment if we want maximum cooperation from other countries and industry in our fight against terrorist networks. So while some have moved on from the debates over our surveillance programs, I have not. As promised, our intelligence agencies have worked hard, with the recommendations of privacy advocates to increase transparency and build more safeguards against potential abuse.And next month, well issue a report on how were keeping our promise to keep our country safe while strengthening privacy.Looking to the future instead of the past, making sure we match our power with diplomacy and use force wisely. Building coalitions to meet new challenges and opportunities. Leading always with the example of our values. Thats what makes us exceptional. Thats what keeps us strong. And thats why we have to keep striving to hold ourselves to the highest of standards: our own.You know, just over a decade ago, I gave a speech in Boston where I said there wasnt a liberal America, or a conservative America; a black America or a white America, but a United State",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 of America.I said this because I had seen it in my own life, in a nation that gave someone like me a chance; because I grew up in Hawaii, a melting pot of races and customs; because I made Illinois my home, a state of small towns, rich farmland, and one of the worlds great cities; a microcosm of the country where Democrats and Republicans and Independents, good people of every ethnicity and every faith, share certain bedrock values.Over the past six years, the pundits have pointed out more than once that my presidency hasnt delivered on this vision. How ironic, they say, that our politics seems more divided than ever. Its held up as proof not just of my own flaws, of which there are many, but also as proof that the vision itself is misguided, nave, that there are too many people in this town who actually benefit from partisanship and gridlock for us to ever do anything about it.I know how tempting such cynicism may be. But I still think the cynics are wrong. I still believe that we are one people. I still believe that together  (applause) -- we can do great things, even when the odds are long.I believe this because over and over in my six years in office, I have seen America at its best. Ive seen the hopeful faces of young graduates from New York to California; and our newest officers at West Point, Annapolis, Colorado Springs, and New London. Ive mourned with grieving families in Tucson and Newtown; in Boston, and West Texas, and West Virginia. Ive watched Americans beat back adversity from the Gulf Coast to the Great Plains; from Midwest assembly lines to the Mid-Atlantic seaboard.Ive seen something like gay marriage go from a wedge issue used to drive us apart to a story of freedom across our country, a civil right now legal  (applause) -- in states that seven in ten Americans call home.So I know the good, and optimistic, and big-hearted generosity of the American people who, every day, live the idea that we are our brothers keeper, and our sisters keeper. And I know they expect those of us who serve here to set a better example.So the question for those of us here tonight is how we, all of us, can better reflect Americas hopes. Ive served in Congress with many of you. I know many of you well. There are a lot of good people here, on both sides of the aisle.And many of you have told me that this isnt what you signed up for -- arguing past each other on cable shows, the constant fund-raising, always looking over your shoulder at how the base will react to every decision.Imagine if we broke out of these tired old patterns. Imagine if we did something different.Understand, a better politics isnt one where Democrats abandon their agenda or Republicans simply embrace mine; a better politics is one where we appeal to each others basic decency instead of our basest fears.A better politics is one where we debate without demonizing each other, where we talk issues and values and principles and facts, rather than gotcha moments or trivial gaffes or fake controversies that have nothing to do with peoples daily lives. (Applause.)A politics -- a better politics is one where we spend less time drowning in dark money for ads that pull us into the gutter, and spend more time lifting young people up with a sense of purpose and possibility, asking them to join in the great mission of building America.If were going to have arguments, lets have arguments. But lets make them debates worthy of this body and worthy of this country.We still may not agree on a womans right to choose, but surely, we can agree its a good thing that teen pregnancies and abortions are nearing all-time lows, and that every woman should have access to the health care that she needs. (Applause.)Yes, passions still fly on immigration, but surely we can all see something of ourselves in the striving young student, and agree that no one benefits when a hardworking mom is snatched from her child, and that its possible to shape a law that upholds our tradition as a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants. Ive talked to Republicans and Democrats about that. Thats something that we can share.We may go at it in campaign season, but surely we can agree that the right to vote is sacred  (applause) -- that its being denied to too many; and that, on this 50th anniversary of the great march from Selma to Montgomery and the passage of the Voting Rights Act, we can come together, Democrats and Republicans, to make voting easier for every single American. (Applause.)We may have different takes on the events of Ferguson and New York. But surely we can understand a father who fears his son cant walk home without being harassed. And surely we can understand the wife who wont rest until the police officer she married walks through the front door at the end of his shift. (Applause.)And surely we can agree its a good thing that for the first time in 40 years, the crime rate and the incarceration rate have come down together, and use that as a starting point for Democrats and Republicans, community leaders and law enforcement, to reform Americas criminal justice system so that it protects and serves all of us. (Applause.)Thats a better politics. Thats how we start rebuilding trust. Thats how we move this country forward. Thats what the American people want. Thats what they deserve. I have no more campaigns to run. My only agenda -- (applause, laughter) -- I know, because I won both of them. (Applause, laughter.) My only agenda for the next two years is the same as the one Ive had since the day I swore an oath on the steps of this Capitol: to do what I believe is best for America.If you share the broad vision I outlined tonight, I ask you to join me in the work at hand. If you disagree with parts of it, I hope youll at least work with me where you do agree. And I commit to every Republican here tonight that I will not only seek out your ideas, I will seek to work with you to make this country stronger. (Applause.)Because -- because I want this chamber, I want this city, to reflect the truth that for all our blind spots and shortcomings, we are a people with the strength and generosity of spirit to bridge divides, to unite in common effort, to help our neighbors, whether down the street or on the other side of the world.I want our actions to tell every child, in every neighborhood: your life matters, and we are as committed to improving your life chances  (applause) -- as committed as we are we are to working on behalf of our own kids.I want future generations to know that we are a people who see our differences as a great gift, that we are a people who value the dignity and worth of every citizen: man and woman, young and old, black and white, Latino and Asian, immigrant and Native American, gay and straight, Americans with mental illness or physical disability. Everybody matters.I want them to grow up in a country that shows the world what we still know to be true: that we are still more than a collection of red states and blue states; that we are the United States of America. (Applause.) I want them to grow up in a country where a young mom can sit down and write a letter to her president with a story that sums up these past six years:It is amazing what you can bounce back from when you have to. We are a strong, tight-knit family who has made it through some very, very hard times.My fellow Americans, we too are a strong, tight-knit family. We, too, have made it through some hard times. Fifteen years into this new century, we have picked ourselves up, dusted ourselves off and begun again the work of remaking America. We have laid a new foundation. A brighter future is ours to write.Lets begin this new chapter together," and lets start the work right now.Thank you. God bless you. (Applause.) God bless this country we love. Thank you.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/14/us/politics/from-cybersecurity-to-trade-deal-bills-are-expected-to-start-moving-in-congress.html,4/14/15,"WASHINGTON   After a lengthy stretch of legislative somnolence, interrupted occasionally by frenetic action to prevent the government from shutting down, Congress is now pivoting to policy.Over the next several weeks, lawmakers are expected to consider a sweeping trade measure championed by President Obama, a bill that makes significant changes to the Medicare program and the reauthorization of programs for national security and education. They also will take up bills to address cybersecurity, to finance the nations transportation system and to outline budget priorities.On top of that, Congress is enmeshed in a debate over presidential powers as it considers legislation that could scuttle Mr. Obamas proposed framework for a nuclear accord with Iran.Republicans will reach their 100th day in control of Congress on Thursday, and the start has been far slower than promised by Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, who knows that his party needs legislative victories ahead of the 2016 elections.Mr. McConnell was stymied by a long fight over funding the Department of Homeland Security and the protracted consideration of approval for the Keystone XL oil pipeline, which ended in a predictable presidential veto.But for Mr. McConnell and other Republicans, the recent humming of legislation means that committees are doing their jobs, at least for now.What were seeing is a restoration of the Senate, Mr. McConnell said Monday in an email. Committees are working productively in a way we havent seen in years, which allows us to bring bipartisan bills to the Senate floor that can be amended and passed and hopefully sent to the president to become law.The challenge for Mr. McConnell will be to continue momentum while working with a slim majority and hostile Democrats schooled in his techniques of blocking legislation when Republicans were in the minority. There is also the inconvenient fact that three of Mr. McConnells members  Ted Cruz of Texas, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Marco Rubio of Florida  are now running for president, each potentially attempting to outflank the others with a voting record that would seem appealing in the Republican primaries.They sort of wasted the first three months on Keystone and D.H.S. fights, said Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, the third-ranking Democrat. And now a whole lot of things have piled up. And we now have three presidential candidates, and they may pull others to the right. McConnell knows for the good of his party that getting things done are important. He promised it during his campaign, but I think the politics of his party tie him in a knot.Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, said on the floor on Monday: We all remember the lofty promises made by the Republican leader and his party before they assumed power. But yet, here we are still struggling to finish two issues that should have been resolved weeks ago.Interestingly, the two highest-profile issues  trade and cybersecurity  unite the Obama administration with Republicans more than with Democrats.After months of haggling, the Senate and the House are expected to release a hard-fought proposal this week to grant the president ""fast-track"" authority on a trade agreement.The legislation  strongly opposed by many congressional Democrats  would allow the Obama administration to complete negotiations on the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership, the largest trade accord in a generation, knowing that Congress could approve or reject it but not amend it. The bill would apply certain conditions to the trade agreement.After the bills announcement, likely on Wednesday, the Finance Committee would move quickly to complete it and send it to the full Senate, setting up a major showdown in the House. Mr. Obama and the House Republican leadership would be aligned against most House Democrats, who say the bill would harm American jobs, and against the most conservative Republicans, who dislike extending such authority to Mr. Obama.Over the next several weeks, both chambers are expected to consider a major cybersecurity bill designed to encourage private companies to share data with each other, the Department of Homeland Security and, through the department, ultimately the nations intelligence agencies. But past efforts have faltered on the issue of liability protection for the firms. Such legislation is desired by the White House, which views information sharing by private industry as critical to detecting and deterring threats.The Senate is also expected to pass a bill, which was overwhelmingly approved in the House last month, that would establish a new formula for paying doctors in the Medicare program and expand a childrens health program. Such movement is good news for all of our constituents, Democrat or Republican, Mr. McConnell said, and its something well continue to build upon.Movement on various issues had stalled before a two-week congressional recess, which ended on Monday, because Republicans and Democrats got into a tussle over abortion provisions in a bill to combat human trafficking.The bill, sponsored by Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, would create a fund for victims based on fees assessed to the people who bought or sold them. The bill also would have prevented that money from being used to pay for abortions for the victims, an application of the Hyde Amendment, which generally prohibits taxpayer funds from being used for abortions. Many Democrats opposed the measure, which they see as an expansion of abortion restrictions.The issue continues to hold up the confirmation vote of Mr. Obamas nominee for attorney general, Loretta E. Lynch, because Mr. McConnell said the chamber would not vote on her until the trafficking bill moves off the floor. The Senate has been extremely slow to confirm other judicial nominees. On Monday, it confirmed its first of this year  Judge Alfred H. Bennett to the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas  compared with 18 circuit and district court judges approved during the same period last year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/27/opinion/sunday/to-unite-the-earth-connect-it.html,9/27/15,"SEVENTY years ago, the United Nations was formed as the expression of a simple choice: cooperation instead of war. Humanity would stand as one against conflict, poverty and disease. All the worlds voices would be heard.At least, that was the plan.Weve come a long way. Weve halted and reversed the spread of killer diseases, extended life expectancy and raised incomes. Weve even walked ourselves back from the edge of some global conflicts and catastrophes. But progress has not been evenly distributed. Too many people have been left outside of a mostly urban, mostly Northern success story.Seeing that, world leaders put forth a new set of global goals in New York last week. If we want to build a world where not just some but all get to live in security and prosperity, theres a lot still to do, as the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development signed off on by United Nations member states shows.It lists 17 goals and 169 targets, and one of these, 9(c), is a target that we believe is crucial to accelerate realization of all the others: a commitment to provide Internet connectivity for all by 2020.Today over half the people on this planet dont have access. That is not good for anyone  not for the disempowered and disconnected, and not for the other half, whose commerce and security depend on having stable societies.An unprecedented array of technologists and activists  from Mo Ibrahim to Bill and Melinda Gates, action/2015, Ushahidi and Sahara Reporters have come together to support a global Connectivity Declaration, pledging their support for the new global goals and connecting the world to opportunity. This needs to become a global movement.In this century, global development and global connectivity are closely linked. If you want to help people feed, heal, educate and employ themselves around the world, we need to connect the world as well. The Internet should not belong to only three billion people, as it does today. It should be seen as a necessity for development, and a tool that makes larger things possible.In Ethiopia and Tanzania, for example, farmers connect to get better prices, track inventory and make mobile insurance payments in case of bad weather. In Nigeria, citizens use BudgIT, a mobile app, to assess whether governments keep their spending promises. The opportunity is especially great for women. Men have significantly more access to the web, but when women get connected, they use technology as a pathway to better education, health, economic status and security. In Guatemala, cellphones inform mothers how to have healthy pregnancies. In Kenya, women receive financial services via their cellphones thanks to the brilliant M-Pesa microfinance scheme.In the last few weeks, weve watched desperate refugees seek shelter on the frontiers of Europe. Smartphones have made it possible for those left behind to communicate with loved ones across checkpoints and razor wire. The Internet connected our world in shared grief as a Syrian childs death on a beach in Turkey came to symbolize every refugee. Social media carried the message and changed not just popular opinion but public policy.Its one thing to say we should connect the world. The real trick is how.Theres no simple solution or silicon bullet.In many places, increasing connectivity will have to start with extending access to energy. Nine out of 10 rural Africans dont have electricity. Governments can make the difference. This is why we support initiatives like President Obamas Power Africa plan and the bipartisan Electrify Africa Act in Congress, as well as the African Development Banks investments in renewable energy.Where governments lay the foundation, the private sector can build. Promising efforts are underway to bridge the digital divide. But we know the global community can, and must, do more  and urgently. The Intel Foundations work in STEM education, Microsofts use of technology to advance the Millennium Development Goals and Googles Project Loon to connect remote locations illustrate how technology leaders are prioritizing this effort, as is Internet.org, Facebooks contribution to meeting the challenge.More technology companies and entrepreneurs must take more responsibility. Silicon Valley should look beyond itself and act more on issues like education, health care and the refugee crisis. We challenge the tech industry to do far more for those most marginalized, those trapped in poverty, and those beyond or on the edge of the network.All the global goals must be scored  but the goal of connectivity for everyone everywhere will surely hurry this game-thats-not-a-game to its successful conclusion. Hurry being the operative word here.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Well be joined tonight by some of CNBCs top experts on the markets and personal finance.QUINTANILLA: Lets get through the rules of the road. Candidates get 30 seconds to answer the opening question, 60 seconds to answer a formal question, 30 seconds for follow-ups and rebuttals, all at the discretion of the moderators.We want you to weigh in from home. Youll see your tweets at the bottom of the screen. Use the hashtag, #cNBCgopdebate. You can also go to cNBC.com/vote to tell us where you stand throughout the night.So lets introduce the candidates for tonights Republican presidential debate. On the stage from left to right, Governor John Kasich.(APPLAUSE)Governor Mike Huckabee.(APPLAUSE)Governor Jeb Bush.(APPLAUSE)Senator Marco Rubio.(APPLAUSE)Mr. Donald Trump.(APPLAUSE)Dr. Ben Carson.(APPLAUSE)Mrs. Carly Fiorina.(APPLAUSE)Senator Ted Cruz.(APPLAUSE)Governor Chris Christie.(APPLAUSE) And Senator Rand Paul.(APPLAUSE)A lot to get to tonight. So lets get started. This first is an open question.This series of debates is essentially a job interview with the American people. And in any job interview, you know this: you get asked, whats your biggest weakness? So in 30 seconds, without telling us that you try too hard or that youre a perfectionist...(LAUGHTER)...what is your biggest weakness and what are you doing to address it? Well go left to right. Governor Kasich, 30 seconds.KASICH: Good question, but I want to tell you, my great concern is that we are on the verge, perhaps, of picking someone who cannot do this job.Ive watched to see people say that we should dismantle Medicare and Medicaid and leave the senior citizens out  out in the  in the cold. Ive heard them talk about deporting 10 or 11  people here from this country out of this country, splitting families. Ive heard about tax schemes that dont add up, that put our kids in  in a deeper hole than they are today.We need somebody who can lead. We need somebody who can balance budgets, cut taxes...QUINTANILLA: Governor?KASICH: You know, frankly, I did it in Washington, in Ohio, and I will do it again in Washington, if Im president, to get this country moving again.KASICH: country moving again.QUINTANILLA: Governor Huckabee.HUCKABEE: Well, John, I dont really have any weaknesses that I can think of.(LAUGHTER)But my wife is down here in the front, and Im sure, if youd like to talk to her later, she can give you more than youll ever be able to take care of.If I have a weakness, its that I try to live by the rules. I try to live by the rules, no matter what they are, and I was brought up that way as a kid. Play by the rules.And Ill tell you what a weakness is of this country: there are a lot of people who are sick and tired because Washington does not play by the same rules that the American people have to play by.QUINTANILLA: Thank you, Governor. Governor Bush.BUSH: You know, I am by my nature impatient. And this is not an endeavor that rewards that. You gotta be patient. You gotta be  stick with it, and all that.But also, I cant fake anger. I believe this is still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth. And it troubles me that people are rewarded for tearing down our country. Its never been that way in American politics before.BUSH: I cant do it. I just dont believe that this countrys days are going to be deeply  you know, going down. I think were on the verge of the greatest time, and I want to fix the things to let people rise up.QUINTANILLA: Senator Rubio.RUBIO: Thank you for that question. I would begin by saying that Im not sure its a weakness, but I do believe that I share a sense of optimism for Americas future that, today, is eroding from too many of our people.I think theres a sense in this country today that somehow our best days are behind us. And that doesnt have to be true.Our greatest days lie ahead if we are willing to do what it takes now. If were willing to do what it takes now, the 21st century is going to be the new American century, greater than any other era weve had in the history of this great nation.QUINTANILLA: Mr. Trump?TRUMP: I think maybe my greatest weakness is that I trust people too much. Im too trusting. And when they let me down, if they let me down, I never forgive. I find it very, very hard to forgive people that deceived me. So I dont know if you would call that a weakness, but my wife said let up.(LAUGHTER)QUINTANILLA: Dr. Carson?CARSON: Probably in terms of the applying for the job of president, a weakness would be not really seeing myself in that position until hundreds of thousands of people began to tell me that I needed to do it. I do, however, believe in Reagans 11th commandment, and will not be engaging in awful things about my compatriots here.And recognizing that its so important, this election, because were talking about America for the people versus America for the government.QUINTANILLA: Mrs. Fiorina?FIORINA: Well, gee, after the last debate, I was told that I didnt smile enough. (LAUGHTER)QUINTANILLA: Fixed it.FIORINA: But I also think that these are very serious times; 75 percent of the American people think the federal government is corrupt. I agree with them. And this big powerful, corrupt bureaucracy works now only for the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected. Meantime, wages have stagnated for 40 years. We have more Americans out of work or just Americans who quit looking for work for 40 years.Ours was intended to be a citizen government. This is about more than replacing a D with an R. We need a leader who will help us take our government back.QUINTANILLA: Senator Cruz?CRUZ: Im too agreeable, easy going.(LAUGHTER)You know, I think my biggest weakness is exactly the opposite. Im a fighter. I am passionate about what I believe. Ive been passionate my whole life about the Constitution. And, you know, for six-and-a-half years, weve had a gigantic party. If you want someone to grab a beer with, I may not be that guy. But if you want someone to drive you home, I will get the job done and I will get you home.QUINTANILLA: Governor Christie?CHRISTIE: I dont see a lot of weakness on this stage, quite frankly. Where I see the weakness is in those three people that are left on the Democratic stage. You know, I see a socialist, an isolationist and a pessimist. And for the sake of me, I cant figure out which one is which.(LAUGHTER)But I will  but I will tell you this, the socialist says theyre going to pay for everything and give you everything for free, except they dont say theyre going to raise it through taxes to 90 percent to do it. The isolationist is the one who wants to continue to follow a foreign policy that has fewer democracies today than when Barack Obama came into office around the world.But I know who the pessimist is. Its Hillary Clinton. And you put me on that stage against her next September, she wont get within 10 miles of the White House. Take it to the bank.QUINTANILLA: Senator Paul?PAUL: You know, I left my medical practice and ran for office because I was concerned about an $18 trillion debt. We borrow a million dollars a minute. Now, on the floor of the Congress, the Washington establishment from both parties puts forward a bill that will explode the deficit. It allows President Obama to borrow unlimited amounts of money.I will stand firm. I will spend every ounce of energy to stop it. I will begin tomorrow to filibuster it. And I ask everyone in America to call Congress tomorrow and say enough is enough; no more debt.QUINTANILLA: Thanks to all the candidates.John?HARWOOD: Mr. Trump, youve done very well in this campaign so far by promising to build a wall and make another country pay for it.TRUMP: Right.HARWOOD: Send 11 million people out of the country. Cut taxes $10 trillion without increasing the deficit.TRUMP: Right.HARWOOD: And make Americans better off because your greatness would replace the stupidity and incompetence of others.TRUMP: Thats right.HARWOOD: Lets be honest.(LAUGHTER)Is this a comic book version of a presidential campaign?TRUMP: No, not a comic book, and its not a very nicely asked question the way you say that.Larry Kudlow is an example, who I have a lot of respect for, who loves my tax plan. Were reducing taxes to 15 percent. Were bringing corporate taxes down, bringing money back in, corporate inversions. We have $2.5 trillion outside of the United States which we want to bring back in.As far as the wall is concerned, were going to build a wall. Were going to create a border. Were going to let people in, but theyre going to come in legally. Theyre going to come in legally. And its something that can be done, and I get questioned about that. They built the great wall of China. Thats 13,000 miles. Here, we actually need 1,000 because we have natural barriers. So we need 1,000.TRUMP: We can do a wall. Were going to have a big, fat beautiful door right in the middle of the wall. Were going to have people come in, but theyre coming in legally. And Mexicos going to pay for the wall because Mexico  I love the Mexican people; I respect the Mexican leaders  but the leaders are much sharper, smarter and more cunning than our leaders.And just to finish, people say, how will you get Mexico to pay? A politician other than the people in the states  I dont want to  a politician cannot get them to pay. I can. We lose, we have a trade imbalance...Excuse me, John.... of $50 billion...HARWOOD: Were at the 60 seconds.TRUMP: ... believe me the world is peanuts by comparison.HARWOOD: Were at 60 seconds, but I gotta ask you, you talked about your tax plan. You say that it would not increase the deficit because you cut taxes $10 trillion in the economy would take off like...(CROSSTALK)HARWOOD: Hold on, hold on. The economy would take off like a rocket ship.TRUMP: Right. Dynamically.HARWOOD: I talked to economic advisers who have served presidents of both parties. They said that you have as chance of cutting taxes that much without increasing the deficit as you would of flying away from that podium by flapping your arms.TRUMP: Then you have to get rid of Larry Kudlow, who sits on your panel, whos a great guy, who came out the other day and said, I love Trumps tax plan.(CROSSTALK)HARWOOD: The Tax Foundation says  has looked at all of our plans and  and his creates, even with the dynamic effect, $8 trillion dollar deficit... QUICK: Gentlemen  well  well get back to this  just a minute  just a minute were gonna continue this.I wanna talk taxes...QUINTANILLA: Hold it. Well cut it back to you in just a minute. Beckys moving on.QUICK: Dr. Carson, lets talk about taxes.You have a flat tax plan of 10 percent flat taxes, and  Ive looked at it  and this is something that is very appealing to a lot of voters, but Ive had a really tough time trying to make the math work on this.If you were to took a 10 percent tax, with the numbers right now in total personal income, youre gonna come in with bring in $1.5 trillion. That is less than half of what we bring in right now. And by the way, its gonna leave us in a $2 trillion hole.So what analysis got you to the point where you think this will work?CARSON: Well, first of all, I didnt say that the rate would be 10 percent. I used the tithing analogy.QUICK: I  I understand that, but if you  if you look at the numbers you probably have to get to 28.CARSON: The rate  the rate  the rate is gonna be much closer to 15 percent.QUICK: 15 percent still leaves you with a $1.1 trillion hole.CARSON: You also have to get rid of all the deductions and all the loopholes. You also have to some strategically cutting in several places.Remember, we have 645 federal agencies and sub-agencies. Anybody who tells me that we need every penny and every one of those is in a fantasy world.So, also, we can stimulate the economy. Thats gonna be the real growth engine. Stimulating the economy  because its tethered down right now with so many regulations...QUICK: Youd have to cut  youd have to cut government about 40 percent to make it work with a $1.1 trillion hole.CARSON: Thats not true.QUICK: That is true, I looked at the numbers.CARSON: When  when we put all the facts down, youll be able to see that its not true, it works out very well.QUICK: Dr. Carson, thank you.KASICH: Listen, I want to just comment.HARWOOD: Governor Kasich, hold it, Im coming to you right now. The...KASICH: Well I want to comment on this. This is the fantasy...HARWOOD: Well, Im asking you about this.KASICH: This is the fantasy that I talked about in the beginning.HARWOOD: Im about to ask you about this.That is, you had some very strong words to say yesterday about whats happening in your party and what youre hearing from the two gentlemen weve just heard from. Would you repeat it?KASICH: Im the only person on this stage that actually was involved in the chief architect of balancing the Federal Budget.You cant do it with empty promised. You know, these plans would put us trillions and trillions of dollars in debt.I actually have a plan. Im the only one on this stage that has a plan that would create jobs, cut taxes, balance the budget and can get it done because Im realistic. You just dont make promises like this.Why dont we just give a chicken in every pot, while were, you know, coming up  coming up with these fantasy tax schemes. Well just clean it up. Where are you gonna clean it up?You have to deal with entitlements, you have to be in a position to control discretionary spending. You gotta be creative and imaginative.Now, let me just be clear, John. I went into Ohio where we had an $8 billion hole and now we have a $2 billion surplus. Were up 347,000 jobs.When I was in Washington, I fought to get the budget balanced. I was the architect. It was the first time we did it since man walked on the moon. We cut taxes and we had a $5 trillion projected surplus when I left.Thats was hard work. Fiscal discipline, know what youre doing. Creativity.This stuff is fantasy. Just like getting rid of Medicare and Medicaid. Come on, thats just not  you scare senior citizens with that. Its not responsible.HARWOOD: Well, lets just get more pointed about it. You said yesterday that you were hearing proposals that were just crazy from your colleagues.Who were you talking about?KASICH: Well, I mean right here. To talk about were just gonna have a 10 percent tithe and thats how were gonna fund the government? And were going to just fix everything with waste, fraud, and abuse? Or that were just going to be great? Or were going to ship 10 million Americans  or 10 million people out of this country, leaving their children here in this country and dividing families?Folks, weve got to wake up. We cannot elect somebody that doesnt know how to do the job. You have got to pick somebody who has experience, somebody that has the know-how, the discipline.And I spent my entire lifetime balancing federal budgets, growing jobs, the same in Ohio. And I will go back to Washington with my plan.QUINTANILLA: Governor  Governor. thank you, Governor.KASICH: And I will have done it within 100 days, and it will pass. And we will be strong again. Thank you.QUINTANILLA: Mr. Trump, 30 seconds.TRUMP: First of all, John got lucky with a thing called fracking, OK? He hit oil. He got lucky with fracking. Believe me, that is why Ohio is doing well. Number  and that is important for you to know.Number two, this was the man that was a managing general partner at Lehman Brothers when it went down the tubes and almost took every one of us with it, including Ben and myself, because I was there and I watched what happened.And Lehman Brothers started it all. He was on the board. And he was a managing general partner.And just thirdly, he was so nice. He was such a nice guy. And he said, oh, Im never going to attack. But then his poll numbers tanked. He has got  that is why he is on the end.(LAUGHTER) And he got nasty. And he got nasty. So you know what? You can have him.(CROSSTALK)KASICH: Let me just  let me respond. First of all, Ohio does have an energy industry, but were diversified. Were one of the fastest growing states in the country. We came back from the dead. And you know what? It works very, very well.And secondly, when you talk about me being on the board of Lehman Brothers, I wasnt on the board of Lehman Brothers. I was a banker and I was proud of it. And I traveled the country and learned how people made jobs.We ought to have politicians who not only have government experience but know how the CEOs and the job creators work. My state is doing great across the board. And guess what, in 2011, I got a deal...QUICK: Governor...KASICH: ... an agreement with the...(CROSSTALK)KASICH: ... that he tried to take credit for four years later. Its a joke.QUINTANILLA: Thank you, Governor.QUICK: Dr. Carson, let me get 30 seconds with Dr. Carson...(CROSSTALK)CARSON: Since I was attacked too.QUICK: Thank you.CARSON: Let me just say, if youre talking about an $18 trillion economy, youre talking about a 15 percent tax on your gross domestic product. Youre talking about $2.7 trillion. We have a budget closer to $3.5 trillion.But if you also apply that same 15 percent to several other things, including corporate taxes, and including the capital gains taxes, you make that amount up pretty quickly. So that is not by any stretch a pie in the sky.CRUZ: Becky, if you want a 10 percent flat tax where the numbers add up, I rolled out my tax plan today, you can find it on line at tedcruz.org. It is a simple flat tax where for individuals, a family of four pays nothing on the first $36,000.After that you pay 10 percent as a flat tax going up. The billionaire and the working man, no hedge fund manager pays less than his secretary.On top of that, there is a business flat tax of 16 percent. Now that applies universally to giant corporations that with lobbyists right now are not paying taxes, and as small business.And you wanted to know the numbers, the Tax Foundation, which has scored every one of our plans, shows that this plan will allow the economy to generate 4.9 million jobs, to raise wages over 12 percent, and to generate 14 percent growth.And it costs, with dynamic scoring, less than a trillion dollars. Those are the hard numbers. And every single income decile sees a double-digit increase in after-tax income.QUICK: Senator  Senator, thank you.CRUZ: Growth is the answer. And as Reagan demonstrated, if we cut taxes, we can bring back growth.QUICK: Gentlemen, Im sorry, we need to...(CROSSTALK)QUINTANILLA: Were going to try to move on.(CROSSTALK)FIORINA: Let me just say on taxes, how long have we been talking about tax reform in Washington, D.C.? We have been talking about it for decades. We now have a 73,000-page tax code.There have been more than 4,000 changes to the tax plan since 2001 alone. There are loads of great ideas, great conservative ideas from wonderful think tanks about how to reform the tax code.The problem is we never get it done. We have talked about tax reform in every single election for decades. It never happens. And the politicians always say it is so complicated, nobody but a politician can figure it out.The truth is this, the big problem, we need a leader in Washington who understands how to get something done, not to talk about it, not to propose it, to get it done.QUINTANILLA: You want to bring 70,000 pages to three?FIORINA: Thats right, three pages.QUINTANILLA: Is that using really small type?FIORINA: You know why three?QUINTANILLA: Is that using really small type?FIORINA: No. You know why three? Because only if its about three pages are you leveling the playing field between the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected who can hire the armies of lawyers and accountants and, yes, lobbyists to help them navigate their way through 73,000 pages.Three pages is about the maximum that a single business owner or a farmer or just a couple can understand without hiring somebody. Almost 60 percent of American people now need to hire an expert to understand their taxes.So yes, youre going to hear a lot of talk about tax reform QUINTANILLA: Mrs. Fiorina FIORINA:  the issue is who is going to get it done.(CROSSTALK)QUINTANILLA: Were going to QUICK: Were going to move on.QUINTANILLA: We will come around the bend, i promise. This one is for Senator Rubio. Youve been a young man in a hurry ever since you won your first election in your 20s. Youve had a big accomplishment in the Senate, an immigration bill providing a path to citizenship the conservatives in your party hate, and even you dont support anymore. Now, youre skipping more votes than any senator to run for president. Why not slow down, get a few more things done first or least finish what you start?RUBIO: Thats an interesting question. Thats exactly what the Republican establishment says too. Why dont you wait in line? Wait for what? This country is running out of time. We cant afford to have another four years like the last eight years.Watching this broadcast tonight are millions of people that are living paycheck to paycheck. Theyre working as hard as they ever have, everything costs more, and they havent had a raise in decades.You have small businesses in America that are struggling. For the first time in 35 years, we have more businesses closing than starting. We have a world thats out of control and has grown dangerous and a president that is weakening our military and making our foreign policy unstable and unreliable in the eyes of our allies. And our adversaries continue to grow stronger.We have a  they say theres no bipartisanship in Washington? We have a $19 trillion bipartisan debt and it continues to grow as we borrow money from countries that do not like us to pay for government we cannot afford.The time to act is now. The time to turn the page is now. If we  if we dont act now, we are going to be the first generation in American history that leaves our children worse off than ourselves.QUINTANILLA: So when the Sun-Sentinel says Rubio should resign, not rip us off, when they say Floridians sent you to Washington to do a job, when they say you act like you hate your job, do you?RUBIO: Let me say, I read that editorial today with a great amusement. Its actually evidence of the bias that exists in the American media today.QUINTANILLA: Well, do you hate your job?RUBIO: Let me  let me answer your question on the Sun-Sentinel editorial today. Back in 2004, one of my predecessors to the Senate by the name of Bob Graham, a Democrat, ran for president missing over 30 percent of his votes. I dont recall them calling for his resignation QUINTANILLA: Is that the standard?RUBIO: Later that year, in 2004, John Kerry ran for president missing close to 60 to 70 percent of his votes. I dont recall the Sun  in fact, the Sun-Sentinel endorsed him. In 2008, Barack Obama missed 60 or 70 percent of his votes, and the same newspaper endorsed him again. So this is another example of the double standard that exists in this country between the mainstream media and the conservative movement.(APPLAUSE)QUINTANILLA: Senator, thank you. John.BUSH: Could I  could I bring something up here, because Im a constituent of the senator and I helped him and I expected that he would do constituent service, which means that he shows up to work. He got endorsed by the Sun-Sentinel because he was the most talented guy in the field. Hes a gifted politician.But Marco, when you signed up for this, this was a six-year term, and you should be showing up to work. I mean, literally, the Senate  what is it, like a French work week? You get, like, three days where you have to show up? You can campaign, or just resign and let someone else take the job. There are a lot of people living paycheck to paycheck in Florida as well, theyre looking for a senator that will fight for them each and every day.RUBIO: I get to respond, right?QUICK: Thirty seconds.RUBIO: Well, its interesting. Over the last few weeks, Ive listened to Jeb as he walked around the country and said that youre modeling your campaign after John McCain, that youre going to launch a furious comeback the way he did, by fighting hard in New Hampshire and places like that, carrying your own bag at the airport. You know how many votes John McCain missed when he was carrying out that furious comeback that youre now modeling after?BUSH: He wasnt my senator.RUBIO: No Jeb, I dont remember  well, let me tell you. I dont remember you ever complaining about John McCains vote record. The only reason why youre doing it now is because were running for the same position, and someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you.BUSH: Well, Ive been RUBIO: Heres the bottom line.(APPLAUSE)Im not  my campaign is going to be about the future of America, its not going to be about attacking anyone else on this stage. I will continue to have tremendous admiration and respect for Governor Bush. Im not running against Governor Bush, Im not running against anyone on this stage. Im running for president because there is no way we can elect Hillary Clinton to continue the policies of Barack Obama.QUINTANILLA: Thank you, Senator.TRUMP: I think youre (APPLAUSE)(CROSSTALK)HARWOOD: Hold on. I think theres a  Ive got question for (CROSSTALK)KASICH: John Harwood, theres a bigger issue here.HARWOOD: Hold on, Governor. Ive got a question for Governor Bush.(CROSSTALK)HARWOOD: No, were moving to Governor Bush. Governor, the fact that youre at the fifth lectern tonight shows how far your stock has fallen in this race, despite the big investment your donors have made.HARWOOD: You noted recently, after slashing your payroll, that you had better things to do than sit around and be demonized by other people. I wanted to ask you BUSH: No, no. What I said was I dont believe that I would be president of the United States and have the same dysfunction that exists in Washington, D.C. now.HARWOOD: OK.BUSH: Dont vote for me if you want to keep the gridlock in Washington, D.C.HARWOOD: Got it.BUSH: But if you want someone who has a proven, effective leadership, that was a governor of a state, that transformed the culture there, elect me so I can fight for the American people and change the culture in Washington, D.C.HARWOOD: But its a  OK. Its a  its a question about why youre having difficulty. I want to ask you in this context.Ben Bernanke, who was appointed Fed chairman by your brother, recently wrote a book in which he said he no longer considers himself a Republican because the Republican Party has given in to know- nothingism. Is that why youre having a difficult time in this race?BUSH: (inaudible), the great majority of Republicans and Americans believe in a hopeful future. They dont believe in building walls and a pessimistic view of the future.Theyre concerned that Washington is so dysfunctional it is holding them back. There are lids on peoples aspirations. Think about it: six and a half million people working part-time. Workforce participation rates lower than they were in 1977.Six million more people living in poverty than the day that Barack Obama got elected president, and the left just wants more of the same. We have to offer a compelling alternative that is based on hope and optimism and grounded in serious policy, which Ive laid out.And you can go get it at jeb2016.com.HARWOOD: Thank you, Governor.(CROSSTALK)HARWOOD: Were gonna get down the line. Beckys got a question.QUICK: Well get to everyone.Ms. Fiorina, I  Id like to ask you a question. You are running for president of the United States because of your record running Hewlett-Packard. But the stock market is usually a fair indicator of the performance of a CEO, and the market was not kind to you.Someone who invested a dollar in your company the day you took office had lost half of the dollar by the day you left. Obviously, youve talked in the past about what a difficult time it was for technology companies, but anybody who was following the market knows that your stock was a much worse performer, if you looked at your competitors, if you looked at the overall market.I just wonder, in terms of all of that  you know, we look back, your board fired you. I just wondered why you think we should hire you now.FIORINA: You know, the NASDAQ dropped 80 percent  80 percent  and it took 15 years for the NASDAQ to recover. I was recruited to H.P. to save a company.It was a company that had grown into a bloated, inept bureaucracy that cost too much and delivered too little to customers and shareholders. It had missed, before I had arrived, expectations for nine quarters in a row.As an outsider, I tackled H.P.s entrenched problems head-on. I cut the bureaucracy down to size, re-introduced accountability, focused on service, on innovation, on leading in every market, in every product segment.And yes, it was a very difficult time. However, we saved 80,000 jobs and we went on to grow to 160,000 jobs, and scores of technology companies literally went out of business  like Gateway  taking all their jobs with them.The truth is I had to make some tough calls in some tough times. I think, actually, people are looking for that in Washington now. And yes, I was fired over a disagreement in the boardroom. There are politics in the boardroom as well.And yet the man who led my firing, Tom Perkins, an icon of Silicon Valley, has come out publicly and said, you know what? We were wrong. She was right. She was a great CEO. Shed be a great president of the United States because the leadership she brought to H.P. is exactly the leadership we need in Washington, D.C.QUICK: Mrs. Fiorina, its interesting that you bring up Mr. Perkins, because...(APPLAUSE) ...he said a lot of very questionable things. Last year, in an interview, he said that he thinks wealthy people should get more votes than poor people.I think his quote was that, if you pay zero dollars in taxes, you should get zero votes. If you pay a million dollars, you should get a million votes. Is this the type of person you want defending you?FIORINA: Well, this is one of the reasons why Tom Perkins and I had disagreements in the boardroom, Becky.(LAUGHTER)Nevertheless, one of the things that I think people dont always understand is how accountable a CEO actually is.So you know, I had to report results every 90 days in excruciating detail. I had to answer every single question about every single result and every single projection in public until there were no more questions.And if I misrepresented those results or those projections in any way, I was held criminally liable. Imagine  imagine  if a politician were held to that standard of account.I will run on my record all day long.(APPLAUSE)And I believe people need a leader who is prepared to make tough calls in tough times and stand up...QUICK: Mrs. Fiorina.FIORINA: ...and be held accountable.QUICK: Thank you, were out of time. Thank you, Mrs. Fiorina.Carl.QUINTANILLA: Senator Cruz.

ional Republicans, Democrats and the White House are about to strike a compromise that would raise the debt limit, prevent a government shutdown and calm financial markets that fear of  another Washington-created crisis is on the way.Does your opposition to it show that youre not the kind of problem-solver American voters want?CRUZ: You know, let me say something at the outset. The questions that have been asked so far in this debate illustrate why the American people dont trust the media.(APPLAUSE) This is not a cage match. And, you look at the questions  Donald Trump, are you a comic-book villain? Ben Carson, can you do math? John Kasich, will you insult two people over here? Marco Rubio, why dont you resign? Jeb Bush, why have your numbers fallen?How about talking about the substantive issues the people care about?(APPLAUSE)QUINTANILLA: (inaudible) do we get credit (inaudible)?CRUZ: And Carl  Carl, Im not finished yet.CRUZ: The contrast with the Democratic debate, where every fawning question from the media was, Which of you is more handsome and why?(LAUGHTER)And let me be clear.(CROSSTALK)QUINTANILLA: So, this is a question about (inaudible), which you have 30 seconds left to answer, should you choose to do so.CRUZ: Let me be clear. The men and women on this stage have more ideas, more experience, more common sense than every participant in the Democratic debate. That debate reflected a debate between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks.(LAUGHTER)And nobody watching at home believed that any of the moderators had any intention of voting in a Republican primary. The questions that are being asked shouldnt be trying to get people to tear into each other. It should be what are your substantive positions...(CROSSTALK)QUINTANILLA: OK. (inaudible) I asked you about the debt limit and I got no answer.(CROSSTALK)CRUZ: You want me to answer that question? Im happy to answer the question...(CROSSTALK)CRUZ: Let me tell you how that question...(CROSSTALK)CRUZ: Let me tell you how that question...(CROSSTALK)HARWOOD: Senator Paul, Ive got a question for you on the same subject.CRUZ: ... so you dont actually want to hear the answer, John?HARWOOD: Senator Paul?CRUZ: You dont want to hear the answer. You just want to...(CROSSTALK)HARWOOD: You used your time on something else.Senator Paul?CRUZ: Youre not interested in an answer.(CROSSTALK)HARWOOD: Senator Paul, the budget deal crafted by Speaker Boehner and passed by the House today makes cuts in entitlement programs, Medicare and Social Security disability, which are the very programs conservatives say need cutting to shrink government and solve our countrys long-term budget deficit. Do you oppose that budget deal because it doesnt cut those programs enough?PAUL: No, I oppose it because youre taking money from the entitlement and then spending it immediately on other items. Thats what theyre doing. Theyre taking money from Social Security and theyre going to spend it on the military and theyre going to spend it on domestic spending.Heres the thing. When you look at raising the debt limit, it should be leverage to try to reform government. In 2011, the sequester was passed as a reform to slow down the rate of government. Instead, the Washington establishment raised both. We raised the military spending, took from entitlements, and raised domestic spending and the deficit will explode under this. This is the unholy alliance that people need to know about between right and left. Right and left are spending us into oblivion. We should use the debt ceiling, as precisely to Don, to force upon them budgetary reforms.HARWOOD: Senator, if what you just said is true, why did Speaker Boehner craft this deal and why did Paul Ryan, who has a strong reputation for fiscal discipline, vote for it?PAUL: Well, thats a real question. Is there going to be any change in the House with new leadership? I frankly dont think there will be much change because I think whats going to happen is youre going to get more of the same. People in Washington think they were sent there to be adults and govern and do all this. Well, you know what Im worried about? Not keeping the government open. Im worried about bankrupting the American people.Were borrowing a million dollars a minute. That is important. And thats what we have to contrast. Keeping the government open and continuing to borrow a million dollars a minute.(CROSSTALK)HARWOOD: Thank you, Senator (inaudible).QUICK: Governor Christie, Id like to (inaudible) a question next. Actually, I have a question for you (inaudible).In your tell it like it is campaign, youve said a lot of tough things. Youve said that we need to raise the retirement age for Social Security. You think that we need to cut benefits for people who make over $80,000 and eliminate them entirely for seniors who are making over $200,000.Governor Huckabee, who is here on the stage, has said that you and others who think this way are trying to rob seniors of the benefits that theyve earned. It raises the question: When it is acceptable to break a social compact?RITCHIE: Well, I wish you would have asked that question years ago when they broke it. I mean, let me be honest with the people who are watching at home. The government has lied to you and they have stolen from you. They told you that your Social Security money is in a trust fund. All thats in that trust fund is a pile of IOUs for money they spent on something else a long time ago.And theyve stolen from you because now they know they cannot pay these benefits and Social Security is going to be insolvent in seven to eight years. Were sitting up here talking about all these other things; 71 percent of federal spending today is on entitlements, and debt service. And, thats with zero percent interest rates.Now, Im the only person thats put out a detailed plan on how to deal with entitlements. And well save a trillion dollars over the next 10 years. And, heres the difference between me and Hillary Clinton. What Hillary Clintons going to say, and has said before is, she wants to raise Social Security taxes.Now, let me ask you a question everybody, and, this is for the guy, you know, who owns a landscaping business out there. If somebodys already stolen money from you, are you going to give them more? Or, are you going to deal with the problem by saying, Im going to give people whove done well in this country less benefit on the backend. We need to get realistic about this. Were not  the American people  forget about anything else, theyve already been lied to and stolen from. And...QUICK: ...Governor...CHRISTIE: ...Im going to go to Washington to stop it...QUICK: ...Thank you.QUINTANILLA: We promised we would get to everyone this block. Governor Huckabee, Im going to give you 60 seconds on this.HUCKABEE: Well, I would really appreciate that. First of all, yes, weve stolen. Yes, weve lied to the American people about Social Security, and Medicare.But, you know what were not telling them? Its their money. This isnt the governments money. This is not entitlement, its not welfare. This is money that people have confiscated out of their paychecks. Everytime they got a paycheck, the government reached in and took something out of it before they ever saw it. Now, were going to blame the people.Today congress decided to take another $150 billion dollars away from Social Security so they can borrow more money. That makes no sense to everybody. And, theyre always going to say, Well, were going to fix this one day.No their not. Its like a 400 pound man saying, Im going to go on a diet, but Im eating a sack of Krispy Kremes before I do.And, people are sick of believing that the government is never going to really address this. But, let me tell you who not to blame. Lets quit blaming the people on Social Security. Lets quit making it a problem for them. Its like them getting mugged, and then us saying, well, were going to mug you some more. You ought to just be able to get over it, get used to it...QUINTANILLA: ...Governor...HUCKABEE: ...No, sir...QUINTANILLA: ...Thank you, Governor...HUCKABEE: ...we need to honor our promises...(CROSSTALK)QUINTANILLA: ...Senator Cruz...HUCKABEE: ...before I go. This is the only time Ive had a chance, let me finish.QUINTANILLA: OK, alright.HUCKABEE: ...This is a matter not of math, this is a matter of morality. If this country that does not keep its promise to seniors then what promise can this country hope to be trusted to keep? And, the fact is, none of them.(CROSSTALK)MALE: And, by the way, Carl...(APPLAUSE)HUCKABEE: And, the only way  no...(CROSSTALK)CHRISTIE: ...The only way were going to be morale, the only way were going to keep our promise to seniors is start by following the first rule we should all follow, which is to look at them, treat them like adults, and tell them the truth.It isnt there anymore, Mike. They stole it. It got stolen from them. Its not theirs anymore. The government stole it, and spent it a long time ago... HUCKABEE: ...Chris...CHRISTIE: So, lets stop fooling around about this, lets tell people the truth. For once, lets do that, and stop trying to give them some kind of fantasy thats never going to come true.QUINTANILLA: Senator Cruz...HUCKABEE: ...Chris...QUINTANILLA: ...Before we go to break, were clearly not having that beer you mentioned, but Ill give you 30 more seconds...CRUZ: ...Then Ill buy you a tequila...QUINTANILLA: OK.CRUZ: ...Or, even some famous Colorado brownies.QUINTANILLA: Ill give you 30 seconds to respond...(CHEERING)QUINTANILLA: (INAUDIBLE)HUCKABEE: Since he brought me up, do I not get to respond?QUINTANILLA: Respond on the debt limit, or an answer to the governor, which ever you choose.CRUZ: Well, sure. This deal in Washington is an example of why Washingtons broken. Republican leadership joined with every single Democrat, add $80 trillion to our debt to do nothing to fix the problems.And, let me now on Social Security because we were getting into a good substantive exchange, and I want to say I think both Chris, and Mike are right. Governor Huckabees exactly right, we need to honor the promises made to our seniors, but for younger workers  look. Im 44 years old.It is hard to find someone in my generation that thinks Social Security will be there for us. We can save and preserve and strengthen Social Security by making no changes for seniors, but for younger workers gradually increasing the retirement age, changing the rate of growth so that it matches inflation, and critically allowing younger workers to keep a portion of our tax payments in a personal account that we own, we control them, we can pass on to our kids.QUINTANILLA: 30 seconds, Governor Huckabee.HUCKABEE: John, listen, lets keep in mind that for one-third of the 60 million Americans on Social Security it represents 90 percent of their income. And, when I hear people talking about means testing, lets just remember what that means. If we means test Social Security, it means that the government decides whether or not I deserve it. If a person lives in a seven room house, does the government get to say you dont need seven rooms, were going to take two of them away?HUCKABEE: Folks, the government has no business stealing even more from the people who have paid this in. I just want to remind you, people paid their money. They expect to have it. And, if this government doesnt pay it, than tell me whats different between the government and Bernie Madolf, who sits in prison today for doing less than what the government has done to the people on social security and Medicare in this country.(APPLAUSE)QUINTANILLA: Governor, thank you. We will take a break. The Republican Presidential debate, live from Boulder, Colorado, coming back after a break on CNBC.(APPLAUSE)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)QUICK: Welcome back to the presidential debate for the Republicans. We are live in Boulder, Colorado, right here on CNBC.Folks, well get right back into this.Mr. Trump, lets talk a little bit about bankruptcies. Your Atlantic City casinos filed for bankruptcy four times. In fact, Fitch, the ratings agency, even said that they were serial filers for all of this. You said that you did great with Atlantic City, and you did. But some of the individuals  the bondholders, some of the contractors who worked for you, didnt fare so well.Bankruptcy is a broken promise. Why should the voters believe the promises that youre telling them right now?TRUMP: Well, first of all, like many other very big businessmen, I could name them here, but Im not going to do that for a lot of obvious reasons, but the biggest, and almost all of them, theyve all used the chapter laws, the bankruptcy laws to their own benefit.Before this, I was a very successful person as a developer and as a businessman. Atlantic City has gone bad. I mean, Chris will know about that. Im not blaming Chris, by the way, but he will know about that. Caesars  excuse me  Caesars, the Rolls-Royce, as you know, is in bankruptcy. Almost every hotel in Atlantic City has either been in bankruptcy or will be in bankruptcy  the biggest.But also the biggest people (ph)  now Ive used that to my advantage as a business man, for my family, for myself. I never filed for bankruptcy. But many, many people did. What happened with Atlantic City is very, very disgraceful.Now hundreds of companies Ive opened. Ive used it three times, maybe four times. Came out great. But I guess Im supposed to come out great. That is what I could do for the country. We owe $19 trillion, boy am I good at solving debt problems. Nobody can solve it like me.But I will tell you this, Atlantic City, youre using that, hundreds of companies that I have opened have thrived. I built a net worth of way over $10 billion, and I have done it four times out of hundreds. And Im glad I did it.I used the laws of the country to my benefit, Im sorry.QUICK: Mr. Trump, thank you.TRUMP: Thank you.CRAMER: Dr. Carson, in recent weeks, a number of pharmaceutical companies has been accused of profiteering, for dramatically raising the prices of life-saving drugs. You have spent a lifetime in medicine.Have these companies gone too far? Should the government be involved in controlling some of these price increases?CARSON: Well, there is no question that some people go overboard when it comes to trying to make profits, and they dont take into consideration the American people. What we have to start thinking about, as leaders, particularly in government, is what can we do for the average American? And you think about the reasons that were having such difficulty right now with our job market.Well, the average small manufacturer, whatever theyre manufacturing, drugs or anything, if they have less than 50 employees, the average cost in terms of regulations is $34,000 per employee. Makes it a whole lot easier for them to want to go somewhere else.So what were going to have to start doing instead of, you know, picking on this group or this group, is were going to have to have a major reduction in the regulatory influence that is going on.The government is not supposed to be in every part of our lives, and that is what is causing the problem.CRAMER: Thank you, Dr. Carson.Governor Christie, there has been a lot of political rhetoric that some bank executives should have gone to jail for the 2008 financial crisis.But General Motors paid more than $1 billion in fines and settlements for its ignition switch defect. One hundred and twenty- four people died as a result of these faulty switches. No one went to jail.As a former prosecutor, do you believe the people responsible for the switch and the cover-up belong behind bars?CHRISTIE: You bet they do. And if I were the prosecutor, that is exactly where they would be. The fact is that this Justice Department under this president has been a political Justice Department.It has been a Justice Department that decided that they want to pick who the winners and losers are. They like General Motors, so they give them a pass. They dont like somebody else like David Petraeus, they prosecute them and send a decorated general on to disgrace. Its a political Justice Department.And, Jim, you know full well that in the seven years I was U.S. attorney we went after pharmaceutical companies. We went after companies that were ripping off shareholders. We went after companies that were doing things that were against the law.And to expand on Mr. Carsons  or Dr. Carsons question, lets face it, we have laws already. We dont need newer (ph) laws. We dont need Hillary Clintons price controls for  again, does anybody out there think that giving Washington, D.C., the opportunity to run the pharmaceutical industry is a good idea, given how well they have done running the government?So what we do, though, is, if there is somebody who is price- gouging, we have laws for prosecutors to take that on. Lets let a Justice Department  and I will make an attorney general who will enforce the law and make justice more than just a word. It will be a way of life.CRAMER: Thank you, Governor Christie.HARWOOD: Jim, thanks.Governor Bush, in a debate like this four years ago, every Republican running for president pledged to oppose a budget deal containing any tax increase even if it had spending cuts ten times as large.A few months later, you told Congress, put me in, coach, you said you would take that deal. Still feel that way?BUSH: Well, the deal was done. Barack Obama got his massive tax increase, and there was no spending cuts. You just see the recent deal announced today or yesterday, more spending, more tax increasing, more regulation. And now we have to accept 2 percent, the new normal for economic growth.And the net result is the middle class has $2,300 less in their pockets than the day that Barack Obama got elected president. And now they see Hillary Clinton proposing a third term of economic policy for our country.We need to reverse that. And my record was one of cutting taxes each and every year. You dont have to guess about it, because I actually have a record. $19 billion of tax cuts, 1.3 million jobs created. We were one of two states to go to AAA bond rating, and our government spending was far less than the spending in peoples income.HARWOOD: But to  to the point that you made to Congress, if you were president and you were offered a bipartisan deal that had one dollar...BUSH: You find me...HARWOOD: ...one dollar of tax increases per ten dollars of spending cuts, would you take it?BUSH: You find me a Democrat  you find me a Democrat that will cut spending ten dollars? Heck, find me a Republican in Congress that would cut spending ten dollars. Ill talk to them.HARWOOD: So you dont want the coach to put you in any more?BUSH: Look, the  the deal is already done. The biggest tax increase happened under the watch of Barack Obama, and spendings gone up. You find a Democrat thats for cutting taxes  cutting spending ten dollars, Ill give them a warm kiss.(LAUGHTER)HARWOOD: Thank you, governor.Carl?QUINTANILLA: Mrs. Fiorina, in 2010, while running for Senate in Tech Ridge (ph), California, you called an Internet sales tax a bad idea. Traditional brick and mortar stores obviously disagree. Now that the Internet shopping playing field has matured, what would be a fair plan to even that playing field?FIORINA: You know, I want to go back for a moment to what we were just talking about. Crony capitalism is alive and well, and has been so in Washington, D.C. for decades.Whats crony capitalism? Crony capitalism is what happens when government gets so big and so powerful that only the big and the powerful can handle it.So why are the pharmaceutical companies consolidating? Why are there five even bigger Wall Street banks now, instead of the ten we used to have on Wall Street? Because when government gets big and powerful, the big feel like they need to get even bigger to deal with all that power, and meanwhile, the small and the powerless  in this case,1,590 community banks  go out of business.You see, folks, this is how socialism starts. Government causes a problem, and then government steps in to solve the problem. This is why, fundamentally, we have to take our government back.The student loan problem has been created by government. Government trying to level the playing field between Internet and brick-and-mortar creates a problem. The FCC jumping in now and saying, were going to put 400 pages of regulation over the Internet, is going to create massive problems.But guess who pushed for that regulation? The big Internet companies. This is whats going on. Big and powerful use big and powerful government to their advantage.Its why you see Walgreens buying Rite Aid. Its why you see the pharmaceuticals getting together. Its you see the health insurance companies getting together. Its why you see the banks consolidating.And meanwhile, small businesses are getting crushed. Community- based businesses and farms are getting crushed. Community banks are going out of business. Big government favors the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected, and crushes the small and the powerless.QUINTANILLA: Mrs. Fiorina.FIORINA: It is why we have to simplify. It is why we have to reduce the size and power of government.QUINTANILLA: OK.FIORINA: Its the only way to level the playing field between big and powerful and small and powerless.QUINTANILLA: Thank you very much.(APPLAUSE) QUICK: Senator Rubio, you yourself have said that youve had issues. You have a lack of bookkeeping skills. You accidentally inter-mingled campaign money with your personal money. You faced (ph) foreclosure on a second home that you bought. And just last year, you liquidated a $68,000 retirement fund. Thats something that cost you thousands of dollars in taxes and penalties.In terms of all of that, it raises the question whether you have the maturity and wisdom to lead this $17 trillion economy. What do you say?RUBIO: Well, you just  you just listed a litany of discredited attacks from Democrats and my political opponents, and Im not gonna waste 60 seconds detailing them all. But Im going to tell you the truth.Heres the truth. I didnt inherit any money. My dad was a bartender, my mother was a maid. They worked hard to provide us the chance at a better life.They didnt save enough money for us to go to school. I had to work my way through school. I had to borrow money to go to school. I tried (ph), early in my marriage, explaining to my wife why someone named Sallie Mae was taking $1,000 out of our bank account every month.(LAUGHTER)I know what its like to owe that money, and weve worked hard. Weve worked hard our whole life to provide a better family  a better life for our family.We own a home four blocks away from the place that I grew up in. My four children have been able to receive a good Christian education, and Ive been able to save for them to go to college so they never have to have the loans that I did.But Im not worried about my finances, Im worried about the finances of everyday Americans who today are struggling in an economy that is not producing good paying jobs while everything else costs more. And thats what this economy needs to  thats what this debate needs to be about.This debate needs to be about the men and women across this country that are struggling on a daily basis to provide for their families the better future that weve always said this country is all about.QUICK: Senator, I understand all of that. I had a lot of student loans when I got out, too. But youve had a windfall that a lot of Americans havent. You made over a million dollars on a book deal, and some of these problems came after that.RUBIO: And I used it to pay off my loans. And its available on paperback, if youre interested in buying my book.(APPLAUSE)QUICK: But you  but you liquidated that retirement account after the fact, and that cost you about $24,000 out of that in taxes and feed. That  that was after youd already come into that windfall. Thats why I raised the question.RUBIO: Yeah, again, as I said, were raising a family in the 21st century and its one of the reasons why my tax plan is a pro- family tax plan.It increases the per child tax credit, because I didnt read about this in a book. I know for a fact how difficult it is to raise children, how expensive its become for working families. And I make a lot more than the average American. Imagine how hard it is for these people out there that are making 40,50, $60,000 a year, and theyre trying to provide for their families at a time when this economy is not growing.We cant afford another four years of that. Which is what were gonna get if we elect a big government liberal like Hillary Clinton to the White House.Thank you, senator.HARWOOD: Governor John Kasich, youve called for abolishing the Export Import Bank, which provides subsidies to help American companies compete with overseas competitors. You call that corporate welfare.One of the largest newspapers in your state wrote an editorial, said they found that strange, writing, that if thats corporate welfare, what does Kasich call the millions of dollars in financial incentives doled out to attract or retain jobs by his development effort  jobs Ohio.If subsidies are good enough for Ohio companies, why arent they good enough for companies trying to compete overseas?KASICH: Well, first of all, when we talk about the Import Export Bank, its time to clean up corporate welfare. If were gonna reform welfare for poor people, we ought to reform it for rich people, as well. Secondly, in our state, we went from a loss of 350,000 jobs to, now, a gain of 347,000 jobs to the positive. Our wages are growing faster than the national average, and Ive cut taxes more than any sitting governor in this state  $5 billion, including no taxes on small business and killing the death tax.I want to go back to what we were talking about earlier, this budget deal in Washington.This is the same old stuff since I left.You spend the money today and then you hope youre going to save money tomorrow.I dont know if people understand, but I spent a lifetime with my colleagues getting us to a federal balanced budget. We actually did it. And I have a road map and a plan right now to get us to balance.Reforming entitlements, cutting taxes. You see, because if you really want to get to a balanced budget, you need to reduce your expenses and you need to grow your economy. So what I will tell you about our incentives  our incentives are tight, and at the end of the day we make sure that we gain more from the creation of jobs than what we lose.And you know what? Ohio, one of the best growing places in the country  I not only did it in Washington, I did it in Ohio, and Ill go back to Washington, and there will be no more silly deals...HARWOOD: Thank you, Governor.KASICH: ... If I become President because well have a Constitutional Amendment to require a federally balanced budget so they will do their job.HARWOOD: Thank you, Governor. Thank you.QUICK: Yes, thank you John.Senator Cruz, working women in this country still earn just 77 percent of what men earn. And I know that youve said youve been very sympathetic to our cause. But youve also you said that the Democrats moves to try and change this are the political show votes.I just wonder what you would do as President to try and help in this cause?CRUZ: Well, weve gotta turn the economy around for people who are struggling.The Democrats answer to everything is more government control over wages, and more empowering trial lawyers to file lawsuits.You know, you look at women working. Ill tell you, in my family there are a lot of single moms in my family. My sister was a single mom, both of my aunts who were a single moms. My mom whos here today, was a single mom when my father left us when I was 3 years old.Now, thank God, my father was invited to a Bible study and became born again and he came back to my mom and me and we were raised together. But I  the struggle of single moms is extraordinary. And you know, when you see Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and all the Democrats talking about wanting to address the plight of working women, not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama, 3.7 million women have entered poverty.Not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama and the big government economy, the median wage for women has dropped $733. The the truth of the matter is, big government benefits the wealthy, it benefits the lobbyists, it benefits the giant corporations. And the people who are getting hammered are small businesses, its single moms, its Hispanics. That is who Im fighting for. The people that Washington leaves behind.(CROSSTALK)FIORINA: Becky, it is the height of hypocrisy for Mrs. Clinton to talk about being the first woman President, when every single policy she espouses, and every single policy of President Obama has been demonstrably bad for women.FIORINA: 92 percent  92 percent of the jobs lost during Barack Obamas first term belonged to women. Senator Cruz is precisely right. Three million women have fallen into poverty under this administration. The number of women QUICK: Mrs. Fiorina FIORINA:  living in extreme poverty is the highest level on record. I am a conservative because I know our values, our principles and our policies QUICK: Mrs. Fiorina, we will come back to you.FIORINA:  work better to lift everyone up, men and women.QUICK: Thank you, Mrs. Fiorina. Carl?(APPLAUSE)QUINTANILLA: Dr. Carson, we know you as a physician, but we wanted to ask you about your involvement on some corporate boards, including Costcos. Last year, a marketing study called the warehouse retailer the number one gay-friendly brand in America, partly because of its domestic partner benefits.Why would you serve on a company whose policies seem to run counter to your views on homosexuality?CARSON: Well, obviously, you dont understand my views on homosexuality. I believe that our Constitution protects everybody, regardless of their sexual orientation or any other aspect. I also believe that marriage is between one man and one woman. And there is no reason that you cant be perfectly fair to the gay community.They shouldnt automatically assume that because you believe that marriage is between one man and one woman that you are a homophobe. And this is one of the myths that the left perpetrates on our society, and this is how they frighten people and get people to shut up. You know, thats what the PC culture is all about, and its destroying this nation.The fact of the matter is we the American people are not each others enemies, its those people who are trying to divide us who are the enemies. And we need to make that very clear to everybody.(APPLAUSE) QUINTANILLA: One more question. This is a company called Mannatech, a maker of nutritional supplements, with which you had a 10-year relationship. They offered claims that they could cure autism, cancer, they paid $7 million to settle a deceptive marketing lawsuit in Texas, and yet youre involvement continued. Why?CARSON: Well, thats easy to answer. I didnt have an involvement with them. That is total propaganda, and this is what happens in our society. Total propaganda.I did a couple of speeches for them, I do speeches for other people. They were paid speeches. It is absolutely absurd to say that I had any kind of a relationship with them.Do I take the product? Yes. I think its a good product.QUINTANILLA: To be fair, you were on the homepage of their website with the logo over your shoulder CARSON: If somebody put me on their homepage, they did it without my permission.QUINTANILLA: Does that not speak to your vetting process or judgment in any way.CARSON: No, it speaks to the fact that I dont know those (AUDIENCE BOOS)See? They know.(APPLAUSE)QUINTANILLA: Apparently. We will take a break. Well be back in Boulder in just a minute.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HARWOOD: Welcome back to the Republican presidential debate on CNBC, live from Boulder, Colorado at the University of Colorado.Senator Huckabee, I mean  excuse me  Senator Rubio, Wired magazine recently carried the heading, Marco Rubio wants to be the tech industrys savior. It noted your support for dramatically increasing immigration visas called H1B, which are designed for workers with the special skills that Silicon Valley wants.But your Senate colleague, Jeff Sessions of Alabama, says in reality, the tech industry uses this program to undercut hiring and wages for highly qualified Americans. Why is he wrong?RUBIO: Well, first of all, if a company gets caught doing that, they should never be able to use the program again. If you get caught abusing this program, you should never be able to use it again.The second thing I said is we need to add reforms, not just increase the numbers, but add reforms. For example, before you hire anyone from abroad, you should have to advertise that job for 180 days. You also have to prove that youre going to pay these people more than you would pay someone else, so that youre not undercutting it by bringing in cheap labor.But heres the best solution of all. We need to get back to training people in this country to do the jobs of the 21st century. Why, for the life of me, I do not understand why did we stop doing vocational education in America, people that can work with their hands; people you can train to do this work while theyre still in high school so they can graduate ready to go work. But the best way to close this gap is to modernize higher education so Americans have the skills for those jobs. But in the interim, in the absence of that, whats happening is some of these tech companies are taking those  those centers (ph) to Canada because they can get people to go over there instead of here.But the ideal scenario is to train Americans to do the work so we dont have to rely on people from abroad.HARWOOD: It sounds like you think Senator Sessions is wrong to believe there is enough abuse in that program that we shouldnt...(CROSSTALK)RUBIO: Well, I believe that there are abuses, those companies should be permanently barred from ever using the program again and we should put strict standards in place to ensure that theyre not being abused, like the prevailing wage requirement and like the advertising requirement.HARWOOD: Thank you, Senator.Becky?QUICK: Mr. Trump, lets stay on this issue of immigration. You have been very critical of Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook who has wanted to increase the number of these H1Bs.TRUMP: I was not at all critical of him. I was not at all. In fact, frankly, hes complaining about the fact that were losing some of the most talented people. They go to Harvard. They go to Yale. They go to Princeton. They come from another country and theyre immediately sent out.I am all in favor of keeping these talented people here so they can go to work in Silicon Valley.QUICK: So youre in favor of...(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: So I have nothing at all critical of him. QUICK: Where did I read this and come up with this that you were...(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: Probably, I dont know  you people write the stuff. I dont know where you...(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: And if I could say just one thing. I am the only person in either campaign thats self-funding. Im putting up 100 percent of my own money. And right now, I will be putting up a tremendous  so far, Ive put up less than anybody and I have the best results. Wouldnt that be nice if the country could do that?But I will be putting  I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money. SuperPacs are a disaster. Theyre a scam. They cause dishonesty. And you better get rid of them because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people. And Im not blaming these folks  well, I guess I could.(LAUGHTER)Very good people are making very bad decisions right now. And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you better get rid of the SuperPacs because they causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and whats going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that have been made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.QUICK: You know, Mr.  you know, Mr. Trump, if I may (inaudible). Youve been  you have been  you had talked a little bit about Marco Rubio. I think you called him Mark Zuckerbergs personal senator because he was in favor of the H1B.TRUMP: I never said that. I never said that.QUICK: So this was an erroneous article the whole way around?TRUMP: Youve got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...QUICK: My apologies. Im sorry.(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: ... hes really doing some bad...(CROSSTALK)RUBIO: Since Ive been mentioned, can I respond?(CROSSTALK)QUICK: Yes, you can.RUBIO: OK. I know the Democrats have the ultimate SuperPac. Its called the mainstream media who every single day...(APPLAUSE)... and Ill tell you why. Last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee. She admitted she had sent e-mails to her family saying, Hey, this attack at Benghazi was caused by Al Qaida-like elements. She spent over a week telling the families of those victims and the American people that it was because of a video. And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clintons campaign.It was the week she got exposed as a liar. It was the week that she got exposed as a liar...(APPLAUSE)But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.QUICK: Senator Rubio, thank you very much.I would like to introduce my colleague, Rick Santelli, he has some comments as well, sir.SANTELLI: Senator Cruz, lets focus on our central bank, the Federal Reserve. Youve been a fierce critic of the Fed, arguing for more transparency. Where do you want to take that?Do you want to get Congress involved in monetary policy, or is it time to slap the Fed back and downsize them completely? What are your thoughts? What do you believe?CRUZ: Well, Rick, its a very important question. I have got deep concerns about the Fed. The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed. And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Pauls audit the Fed legislation.The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women. You know, its interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great. Its driving up stock prices. Wall Street is doing great.You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928. But if you look at working men and women. If you look at a single mom buying groceries, she sees hamburger prices have gone up nearly 40 percent.She sees her cost of electricity going up. She sees her health insurance going up. And loose money is one of the major problems. We need sound money. And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.SANTELLI: Senator Paul, the same question to you.PAUL: Well, thank you very much. I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed. And I think its precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill. I would prevent them lobbying Congress. I dont think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem. You want to study income inequality, lets bring the Fed forward and talk about Fed policy and how it causes income inequality.Lets also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what theyve done to make us better or worse. I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.What you need to do is free up interest rates. Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldnt have price controls on the price of money.SANTELLI: Thank you, Senator.(APPLAUSE)Dr. Carson, you told The Des Moines Register that you dont like government subsidies, it interferes with the free market. But youve also said that youre in favor of taking oil subsidies and putting them towards ethanol processing.Isnt that just swapping one subsidy for another, Doctor?CARSON: Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy. I have...... the best results, wouldnt that be nice if the country could do that?But I will be putting  I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money. Super PACs are a disaster. Theyre a scam. They cause dishonesty. And you had better get rid of them, because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.And Im not blaming these folks  but I guess I could.(LAUGHTER)Very good people are making very bad decisions right now.

I think you called him Mark Zuckerbergs personal senator because he was in favor H- 1B...(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: I never said that. I never said that.QUICK: So this was an erroneous article the whole way around?TRUMP: He has got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...QUICK: My apologies. Im sorry...(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: Everybody is really doing some bad fact...RUBIO: Since Ive been mentioned, can I respond?QUICK: Yes. Yes, you may.RUBIO: OK. You know, the Democrats who have the ultimate super PAC, its called the mainstream media. (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)And Ill tell you why, last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee, she admitted she had sent emails to her family saying, hey, this attack in Benghazi was caused by al Qaeda-like elements.She spent over a week telling the families of those victims and the American people that it was because of a video.

I have studied that issue in great detail. And what I have concluded is that the best policy is to get rid of all government subsidies, and get the government out of our lives, and let people rise and fall based on how good they are.And  you know, all of this too big to fail stuff and picking and choosing winners and losers  this is a bunch of crap, and it is really causing a great deal of  great deal of problems for our society right now.And  and  you know, it goes back to the whole concept of regulations, which are in everything. The reason that I  I hate them so much is because every single regulation costs in terms of goods and services.That cost gets passed on to the people. Now, who are the people who are hurt by that? Its poor people and middle class. Doesnt hurt rich people if their bar of soap goes up ten cents, but it hurts the poor and the middle class.And Bernie Sanders will tell them that its because of the rich. Well, Ill tell you something: you can take everything from the top 1 percent, and you apply it to our fiscal gap, and you wont even make a dent in it.SANTELLI: Thank you, Doctor.Becky?QUICK: Rick, thank you very much.Governor Huckabee, you have railed against income inequality. Youve said that some Wall Street executives should have gone to jail over the roles that they played during the financial crisis.Apart from your tax plan, are there specific steps you would require from corporate America to try and reduce the income inequality.HUCKABEE: I dont think its so much about when the government orders a corporation to do something. In fact, thats part of the problem. If you saw that blimp that got cut loose from Maryland today, its a perfect example of government.I mean, what we had was something the government made  basically a bag of gas  that cut loose, destroyed everything in its path, left thousands of people powerless, but they couldnt get rid of it because we had too much money invested in it, so we had to keep it.That is our government today. We saw it in the blimp.(APPLAUSE)Thats exactly what we saw. So look, corporations ought to exercise some responsibility. When CEO income has risen 90 percent above the average worker, when the bottom 90 percent of this countrys economy has had stagnant wages for the past 40 years, somebody is taking it in the teeth.And its not the folks on Wall Street. Im not anti-Wall Street, but I dont believe the government ought to wear a team jersey, pick winners and losers.QUICK: Governor?HUCKABEE: The government ought to wear a striped shirt and just make sure the game...QUICK: Governor?HUCKABEE: ...is paid  played fairly.QUICK: Thank you. Now, everybody else has fudged their time and gone over, so please, dont cut me off too quick, Becky.QUICK: All right, Governor Huckabee.HUCKABEE: Let me just close it out this way.QUICK: How about 15 more seconds?HUCKABEE: We need to be focusing on what fixes this country. And Ill tell you one thing that we never talk about  we havent talked about it tonight.Why arent we talking about  instead of cutting benefits for old people, cutting benefits for sick people  why dont we say, lets cure the four big cost-driving diseases...QUICK: Governor?HUCKABEE: ...diabetes, heart disease, cancer and Alzheimers?QUICK: Governor, Im sorry...HUCKABEE: If you do that, you dont just change the economy, you transform the lives of millions of hurting Americans.QUICK: Governor, thank you.HUCKABEE: Gosh, Id love for us to talk about something like that. Thank you. QUICK: Governor, thank you. Appreciate it.John?HARWOOD: Governor Bush, the tax reform bill that Ronald Reagan signed in 1986 cut the top personal income tax rate to 28 percent  just like your plan does. But President Reagan taxed capital gains at the same rate, while you would tax them at just 20 percent.Given the problems weve been discussing, growing gap between rich and poor, why would you tax labor at a higher rate than income from investments?BUSH: Look, the  the simple fact is that my plan actually gives the middle class the greatest break: $2,000 per family. And if you make $40,000 a year, a family of four, you dont pay any income tax at all.Simplifying the code and lowering rates, both for corporations and  and personal rates, is exactly what we need to do. You think about the regulatory cost and the tax cost  thats why small businesses are closing, rather than being formed in our country right now.The big corporations have the scale to deal with all of this. And what I think all of us are saying is, our monetary policy, our tax policy, regulatory policy needs to be radically changed so we can create high sustained growth for income to rise.The government has tried it their way. Under  under Barack Obama and the proposals of Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and others, theyve tried it their way, and it has failed miserably.We need to take a new approach of taxing  reforming how we tax, and reforming the regulations in our  in our country before its too late.HARWOOD: Senator Rubio, 30 seconds to you.The Tax Foundation, which was alluded to earlier, scored your tax plan and concluded that you give nearly twice as much of a gain in after-tax income to the top 1 percent as to people in the middle of the income scale.Since youre the champion of Americans living paycheck-to- paycheck, dont you have that backward?RUBIO: No, thats  youre wrong. In fact, the largest after- tax gains is for the people at the lower end of the tax spectrum under my plan. And theres a bunch of things my tax plan does to help them.Number one, you have people in this country that...HARWOOD: The Tax Foundation  just to be clear, they said the...(CROSSTALK)RUBIO: ...you wrote a story on it, and you had to go back and correct it.HARWOOD: No, I did not.RUBIO: You did. No, you did.(APPLAUSE)(CROSSTALK)HARWOOD: Senator, the Tax Foundation said after-tax income for the top 1 percent under your plan would go up 27.9 percent.RUBIO: Well, youre talking about  yeah.HARWOOD: And people in the middle of the income spectrum, about 15 percent.RUBIO: Yeah, but that  because the math is, if you  5 percent of a million is a lot more than 5 percent of a thousand. So yeah, someone who makes more money...HARWOOD: (inaudible)RUBIO: ...numerically, its gonna be higher. But the greatest gains, percentage-wise, for people, are gonna be at the lower end of our plan, and heres why: because in addition to a general personal exemption, we are increasing the per-child tax credit for working families.We are lowering taxes on small business. You know, a lot of business activity in America is conducted like the guy that does my dry cleaning. Hes an S corporation. He pays on his personal rate, and he is paying higher than the big dry-cleaning chain down the street, because hes paying at his personal rate.RUBIO: Under my plan, no business, big or small, will pay more than 25 percent flat rate on their business income. That is a dramatic tax decrease for hard-working people who run their own businesses.(CROSSTALK)RUBIO: ...The other thing Id like to make about our plan, one more point, it is the most pro growth tax plan that I can imagine because it doesnt tax investments at all. You know why? Because the more you tax something, the less of it you get.I want to be in  I want America to be the best...PAUL: ...John...RUBIO: ...in the world for people...HARWOOD: Senator, thank you.PAUL: John, Id like to address this? John, could I follow up on this?QUINTANILLA: ...Well come back around. I want to get to governor Kasich.PAUL: What are the rules on who gets to follow up. How do we decide on who gets to follow up? Ive seen plenty of other people follow up?QUICK: Its at the moderator discretion.QUINTANILLA: Governor Kasich, lets talk ...(CROSSTALK)QUINTANILLA: ...about Marijuana, Governor Kasich...PAUL: Id like to just mention something about my tax plan, and how it relates to the discussion...QUINTANILLA: Alright, but 30 seconds, you made a case. Sure, 30 seconds.PAUL: Alright. Much of the discussion is centered over whether or not the different tax plans help, or affect the middle class. In fact, its the chief argument by democrats against many of the different flat tax proposals. Mine is unique in the sense that my tax plan actually gets rid of the payroll tax as well. It shifts it to the business, and it would allow middle class people to get a tax cut.If you just cut their income tax, there isnt much income tax to cut. Mine actually cuts the payroll tax, and I think it would spread the tax cut across all socioeconomic levels, and would allow then it to be something that would be broadly supported by the public in an election.QUINTANILLA: Senator, thank you.CRUZ: Let me say on that...QUINTANILLA: Oh, no, no, no...CRUZ: ...Rand is exactly right. His plan is a good plan, and I will note that my 10% plan also eliminates the payroll tax, eliminates the death tax,QUINTANILLA: ...Ok...CRUZ: ...eliminates the business...MALE: (INAUDIBLE)CRUZ: ...income tax...MALE: What are you doing?CRUZ: ...10% flat rate...QUINTANILLA: ...Were going to go to...CRUZ: ...is the lowest personal rate any candidate up here has, and what it would also enable us to do is for every citizen to fill out their taxes on a postcard so we can eliminate the IRS.(CHEERING) (APPLAUSE)QUINTANILLA: OK. Thank you, Senator. Governor Kasich, lets talk about marijuana. Were broadcasting from Colorado which has seen $150 million in new revenue for the state since legalizing last year. Governor Hickenlooper is not a big fan of legalization, but hes said the people who used to be smoking it are still smoking it, theyre just now paying taxes.Given the budget pressures in Ohio, and other states, is this a revenue stream youd like to have?KASICH: Well, first of all, were running a $2 billion dollar surplus, were not having a revenue problem right now. And, sending mixed signals to kids about drugs is a disaster. Drugs is one of the greatest scourge in this country, and I spent five years of my administration working with my team to do a whole sort of things to try to reign in the problem of overdoses, and it goes on and on. We could do a whole show on that.I want to go back for a second thought on this issue of income inequality. My program would move the 104 programs of the federal Department of Education into four block grants, and send them back to the states because income inequality is driven by a lack of skills when kids dont get what they need to be able to compete and win in this country.The fact is, in order to get this economy moving again, I call for freezing regulations for a year except for the problem of public safety. I believe that we need to cut these taxes down, we need to be on a roadmap to balancing the budget, and we need to send power, money, and influence, the welfare department, the education department, job training, infrastructure, Medicaid, all of that out of Washington back to the states so we can run these programs from where we live to the top, not a one size fits all mentality that they have in Washington.And, that will get to the nub of opportunity for our children, and an ability to see wages rise. Again...(CROSSTALK)KASICH: ...One more time, in Ohio, our wages are growing faster than the national average. Weve cut taxes, balanced budgets, changed the regulatory environment. Folks, you want to QUINTANILLA: Thank you, Governor.KASICH:  fix America, this is the formula. It worked for Reagan and it works for our team in Ohio. Thank you.QUINTANILLA: Thank you. Well be back from Boulder, Colorado in just a moment.(APPLAUSE)(BREAK)QUICK: Welcome back to the University of Colorado and the Republican presidential debate right here on CNBC.Mr. Trump, I want to go back to an issue that we were talking about before, the H-1B visas. I found where I read that before. It was from the donaldjtrump.com website and it says  it says that again, Mark Zuckerburgs personal senator, Marco Rubio has a bill to triple H-1Bs that would decimate women and minorities. Are you in favor of H-1Bs or are you opposed to them?TRUMP: Im in favor of people coming into this country legally. And you know what? They can have it anyway you want. You can call it visas, you can call it work permits, you can call it anything you want. Ive created tens of thousands of jobs, and in all due respect  and actually some of these folks I really like a lot  but Im the only one that can say that. I have created tens of thousands of jobs, and Ill be creating many millions of jobs if Im given  if Im given the opportunity to be president.As far as Mark is concerned, as far as the visas are concerned, if we need people, they have  its fine. They have to come into this country legally. We have a country of borders. We have a country of laws. We have to obey the laws. Its fine if they come in, but they have to come in legally.QUICK: Thank you, sir.RUBIO: I was mentioned in the question.QUICK: You were. You get 30 seconds.RUBIO: Thank you.Well, Ive learned the rules on this.(LAUGHTER)Look, in addition to what Donald was saying is we also need to talk about the legal immigration system for permanent residents. Today, we have a legal immigration system for permanent residency that is largely based on whether or not you have a relative living here. And thats the way my parents came legally in 1956.But in 2015, we have a very different economy. Our legal immigration system from now on has to be merit-based. It has to be based on what skills you have, what you can contribute economically, and most important of all, on whether or not youre coming here to become an American, not just live in America, but be an American.QUICK: Thank you, Senator. Thank you, Senator.Carl?QUINTANILLA: Mr. Trump, youve said you have a special permit to carry a gun in New York.TRUMP: Yes.QUINTANILLA: After the Oregon mass shooting on October 1st, you said, By the way, it was a gun-free zone. If you had a couple of teachers with guns, you would have been a hell of a lot better off.TRUMP: Or somebody else. Right.QUINTANILLA: Would you feel more comfortable if your employees brought guns to work?TRUMP: Yes, I might feel more comfortable. I would say that I would and I have a permit, which is very unusual in New York  a permit to carry. And I do carry on occasion, sometimes a lot. But I like to be unpredictable so that people dont know exactly... (LAUGHTER)QUINTANILLA: Are you carrying one now?(LAUGHTER)(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: By the way, unlike our country where were totally predictable and the enemy, whether its ISIS or anybody else, they know exactly what were doing because we have the wrong leadership.(APPLAUSE)But I feel that the gun-free zones and, you know, when you say that, thats target practice for the sickos and for the mentally ill. Thats target. They look around for gun-free zones. You know, we could give you another example  the Marines, the Army, these wonderful six soldiers that were killed. Two of them were among the most highly decorated  they werent allowed on a military base to have guns. And somebody walked in and shot them, killed them. If they had guns, he wouldnt be around very long. I can tell you, there wouldnt have been much damage.So, I think gun-free zones are a catastrophe. Theyre a feeding frenzy for sick people.QUINTANILLA: We called a few Trump resorts, a few Trump properties that  that do not allow guns with or without a permit. Would you change those policies?TRUMP: I would change them. I would change them.QUINTANILLA: OK. All right. Thank you.John?HARWOOD: Governor Huckabee, youve written about the huge divide in values between middle America and the big coastal cities like New York and Los Angeles. As a preacher as well as a politician, you know that presidents need the moral authority to bring the entire country together.The leading Republican candidate, when you look at the average of national polls right now, is Donald Trump. When you look at him, do you see someone with the moral authority to unite the country?HUCKABEE: You know, of the few questions Ive got, the last one I need is to give him some more time. I love Donald Trump. He is a good man. Im wearing a Trump tie tonight. Get over that one, OK?(APPLAUSE)(CROSSTALK)(UNKNOWN): Is it made in Mexico?HUCKABEE: I dont know.(UNKNOWN): Wheres it made? Is it made in China?(UNKNOWN): Is it made in China or Mexico?HUCKABEE: I have no idea.(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: Such a nasty  such a nasty question, but thank you, Governor.HUCKABEE: Youre welcome.(LAUGHTER)Let me tell you, Donald Trump would be a president every day of the week and twice on Sunday, rather than Hillary. Ive spent a lifetime in politics fighting the Clinton machine.(APPLAUSE)You want to talk about what were going to be up against next year? Im the only guy on this stage  you know, everybody has an only guy  Im the only guy this; Im the only guy that. Well, let me tell you one thing that I am the only guy: The only guy that has consistently fought the Clinton machine every election I was ever in over the past 26 years. And not only did I fight them, but I beat them.Somebody says Im a fighter. Well, I want to know, did you win? Well, I did. And not only did I fight them and win, I lived to tell about it and Im standing on this stage tonight as evidence of that. And I think that ought to be worth something.HARWOOD: Thank you, Governor.CHRISTIE: John, Ill tell you something. You want to talk about moral authority. Lets talk about something that happened this week in the news. You know, the FBI director, the presidents appointed FBI director has said this week that because of a lack of support from politicians like the president of the United States, that police officers are afraid to get out of their cars; that theyre afraid to enforce the law. And he says, the presidents appointee, that crime is going up because of this.And when the president of the United States gets out to speak about it, does he support police officers? Does he stand up for law enforcement? No, he doesnt. Ill tell you this, the number one job of the president of the United States is to protect the safety and security of the American people. This president has failed, and when Im in the Oval Office, police officers will know that they will have the support of the president of the Untied States. Thats real moral authority that we need in the Oval Office.HARWOOD: Thank you, Governor.Dont forget my colleague, Sharon Epperson.EPPERSON: Thank you, John.Mrs. Fiorina, you were the CEO of a large corporation that offers a 401(k) to its employees. But more than half of American have no access to an employer sponsored retirement plan.That includes the workers at small businesses, and the growing ranks of Uber drivers and other part-timers in the freelance economy.Should the Federal Government play a larger role in helping to set up retirement plans for these workers?FIORINA: No, the Federal Government should not play a larger role.Look, every time the Federal Government gets engaged in something it gets worse. And then the Government steps in to try and solve the problem and we get a little further down to that progressive vision that Hillary Clinton is talking about.Companies should, if they want to attract the best workers, provide a good set of benefits. But honestly, if youre a small business owner today you are being crushed. We have 400,000 small businesses forming every year in this country. How great is that? They are employing themselves, they are potentially employing others.The bad news is, we have 470,000 going out of business every year. And why? They cite Obamacare.They are refusing to...EPPERSON: So you wouldnt agree  you wouldnt agree with a start for 401(k) for businesses or anything like that?FIORINA: I think its a wonderful that that businesses start a 401(k). The point Im making is this, the Federal Government should not be in a lot of things.There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government in setting up  retirement plans. There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government to be setting minimum wages...EPPERSON: Thank you very much.FIORINA: ... The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, the slower the economy becomes. The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, it is demonstrably true...EPPERSON: Thank you, the rules say one minute.FIORINA: ... The more the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected are advantaged.EPPERSON: Thank you, Ms. Fiorina. We appreciate it. Thank you, thank you.I want to turn my attention now, to you now, Governor Kasich.Most people cant get a college degree without going into debt. Over 40 million Americans have student loans and many of them cannot pay them back.This country has over $100 billion in student loan defaults. Thats billion with a b.What will you do to make sure that students, their families, taxpayers, wont feel the economic impact of this burden for generations?Well, first of all, in Ohio were changing the whole system. Universities will not get paid one dime unless the student graduates or  graduates or completes a course.Secondly, you can be in high school and complete almost an entire first year before you go to college and get credit to do that. And, of course, in addition to that, we are working now to go after the cost drivers in our universities. And let me give you an example. Universities today have so many non-academic assets. At Ohio State they sold the parking garage and the parking lot, and they got $500 million because they shouldnt be in the parking lot business. They shouldnt be in the ding business, they shouldnt be in the dorm business.And, of course, we need to take advantage of on-line education to reduce these costs and begin to dis-intermediate the cost of four years.Now, for those who that have these big high costs, I think we can seriously look at an idea of where you can do public service. I mean legitimate, public service and begin to pay off some of that debt through the public service that you do. And in the meantime, it may inspire us to care more about our country, more about ourselves.This is a big moral issue in America. Living a life bigger than yourself, and being a center of healing and justice. And people can learn it through public service.EPPERSON: Thank you, thank you.BUSH: We dont need the federal government to be involved in this at all.QUICK: Higher education is the example...BUSH: We dont need the Federal Government to be involved in this, because when they do we create a $1.2 trillion debt.In Florida, we have the lowest in-state tuition of any state, because theres accountability, just as John said. Let the states do this. Youll create a much better graduation rate at a lower cost, and you wont in debt the next generation with recourse debt on their backs.Its always a solution of the left to create more Government from the Federal Government. It is broke, it is not working.(CROSSTALK)QUINTANILLA: Governor Bush, daily fantasy sports has become a phenomenon in this country, will award billions of dollars in prize money this year. But to play you have to assess your odds, put money at risk, wait for an outcome thats out of your control. Isnt that the definition of gambling, and should the Federal Government treat it as such?BUSH: Well, first of all, Im 7 and 0 in my fantasy league.QUINTANILLA: I had a feeling you were going to brag about that.BUSH: Gronkowski is still going strong. I have Ryan Tannehill, Marco, as my quarterback, he was 18 for 19 last week. So Im doing great. But were not gambling.And I think this has become something that needs to be looked at in terms of regulation. Effectively it is day trading without any regulation at all. And when you have insider information, which apparently has been the case, where people use that information and use big data to try to take advantage of it, there has to be some regulation.If they cant regulate themselves, then the NFL needs to look at just, you know, moving away from them a little bit. And there should be some regulation. I have no clue whether the federal government is the proper place, my instinct is to say, hell no, just about everything about the federal government.(CROSSTALK)CHRISTIE: Carl, are we really talking about getting government involved in fantasy football?(LAUGHTER)We have  wait a second, we have $19 trillion in debt. We have people out of work. We have ISIS and al Qaeda attacking us. And were talking about fantasy football? Can we stop?(APPLAUSE)CHRISTIE: How about this? How about we get the government to do what theyre supposed to be doing, secure our borders, protect our people, and support American values and American families. Enough on fantasy football. Let people play, who cares?(CROSSTALK)QUICK: I want to go back, if I can, to the issue of...(CROSSTALK)QUICK: I want to go back, if I may, to the... HARWOOD: Governor Christie, youve said something that many in your party do not believe, which is that climate change is undeniable, that human activity contributes to it, and you said, quote: The question is, what do we do to deal with it?.So what do we do?CHRISTIE: Well, first off, what we dont do is do what Hillary Clinton and John Kerry and Barack Obama want us to do, which is their solution for everything, put more taxes on it, give more money to Washington, D.C., and then they will fix it.Well, there is no evidence that they can fix anything in Washington, D.C.HARWOOD: What should we do?CHRISTIE: What we should do is to be investing in all types of energy, John, all types of energy. Ive laid out...HARWOOD: You mean government?CHRISTIE: No, John. John, do you want me to answer or do you want to answer?(LAUGHTER)How are we going to do this?(APPLAUSE)Because, Ive got to tell you the truth, even in New Jersey what youre doing is called rude. So...(LAUGHTER)Weve laid out a national energy plan that says that we should invest in all types of energy. I will tell you, you could win a bet at a bar tonight, since were talking about fantasy football, if you ask who the top three states in America are that produce solar energy: California and Arizona are easy, but number three is New Jersey.Why? Because we work with the private sector to make solar energy affordable and available to businesses and individuals in our state.We need to make sure that we do everything across all kinds of energy: natural gas, oil, absolutely. But also where its affordable, solar, wind in Iowa has become very affordable and it makes sense.That is the way we deal with global warming, climate change, or any of those problems, not through government intervention, not through government taxes, and for Gods sake, dont send Washington another dime until they stop wasting the money theyre already sending there.HARWOOD: Thank you, Governor.(APPLAUSE)HARWOOD: Becky.QUICK: Senator Paul, among the leading conservative opponents to the creation of Medicare back in the 1960s was Ronald Reagan. He warned that it would lead to socialism. Considering the mounting cost of Medicare, was he right to oppose it?PAUL: The question always is, what works better, the private marketplace or government? And what distributes goods better? It always seems to be the private marketplace does a better job.Is there an area for a safety net? Can you have Medicare or Social Security? Yes. But you ought to acknowledge the government doesnt do a very good job at it.The main problem with Medicare right now is that the average person pays in taxes over their whole lifetime about $100,000. But the average person takes out about $350,000. We have this enormous mismatch because we have smaller and smaller families.When people ask me, whose fault is it? Whose fault is it that Medicare is broken, out of money, that Social Security is broken, out of money? And I say, look, its not Republicans fault, its not Democrats fault, its your grandparents fault for having too many damn kids.(LAUGHTER)After the war we had all of these kids, Baby Boomers. Now were having smaller families. We used to have 16 workers for one retiree, now you have three workers for one retiree.Its not working. I have a bill to fix Medicare. Ive a bill to fix Social Security. For both of them you have to gradually raise the age. If youre not willing to do that, nobody wants to do it, but if youre not willing to gradually raise the age, youre not serious about fixing either one of them.QUICK: Senator, thank you.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Becky, may I...QUINTANILLA: This is the well, were going to take a break. We want to save time for closing statements after the break.So this is the Republican presidential debate in Boulder, and well be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(APPLAUSE)QUICK: Welcome back to Boulder, Colorado and the Republican presidential debate right here on CNBC.Governor Huckabee, you wanted to respond to the points that Senator Rand Paul was just making when it comes to Social Security. Your time, sir.HUCKABEE: Well, and specifically to Medicare, Becky, because 85 percent of the cost of Medicare is chronic disease. The fact is if we dont address whats costing so much, we cant throw enough money at this. And its why Ive continued to focus on the fact that we need to declare war on the four big cost drivers because 80 percent of all medical costs in this country are chronic disease. We dont have a health care crisis in America, we have a health crisis.And until we deal with the health of Americans and do what we did with polio  when I was a little kid, we eradicated it. You know how much money we spent on polio last year in America? We didnt spend any. Weve saved billions of dollars.You want to fix Medicare? Focus on the diseases that are costing us the trillions of dollars. Alzheimers, diabetes, heart disease and cancer. Eradicate those and you fix Medicare and youve fixed America, its economy and youve made peoples lives a heck of a lot better.BUSH: Becky QUICK: Thank you, Governor.(APPLAUSE)BUSH:  the governors absolutely right. But we also need to reform Medicare and Social Security. We cant just allow it to continue on its current path the way that Hillary Clinton wants to do because therell be major reductions in benefits in the next decade if we do nothing.I have a concrete plan to do just that, which allows people to keep HSAs to encourage savings, it allows for people that are retiring with Social Security to be able to get a minimum of 125 percent of the poverty level so that there is a baseline that in this generous country of ours no one goes below.HARWOOD: Governor Bush, Mr. Trump says that he is capable of growing the economy so much that Social Security and Medicare dont have to be touched. Do you want to explain how that is going to happen, Mr. Trump?TRUMP: Yes, its very simple. Were going to make a really dynamic economy from what we have right now, which is not at all dynamic. Were going to bring jobs back from Japan, were going to bring jobs back from China, were going to bring, frankly, jobs back from Mexico where, as you probably saw, Nabisco is leaving Chicago with one of their biggest plants, and theyre moving it to Mexico.Were going to bring jobs and manufacturing back. Were going to cut costs. Were going to save Social Security, and were going to save Medicare.(UNKNOWN): Governor, you just heard him.BUSH: You have to reform Social Security, and the simple way to do it is to make sure that the wealthiest dont receive the same benefits as people that are lower-income.And make sure you enhance savings in the private market. The idea of 401(k)s. I have a small business that I set up. It took  it took an arm and a leg to be able to set up a 401(k). Because of all the federal mandates and federal laws, it was too expensive.We need to incent private savings and make sure that Social Security is protected for those that have it.KASICH: John.BUSH: But the idea that you cant  that youre just gonna grow your way out of this  I have a plan to grow the economy at 4 percent, but youre gonna have to make adjustments for both Medicare and Social Security.(UNKNOWN): Governor Kasich, do you want 30 seconds?KASICH: I wanna tell you, in my state, we took Medicaid, the hardest program to control, and we took it from a 10 percent growth rate to 2.5 percent without taking one person off the rolls or cutting one single benefit.And so much of what we did  to force competition, to use technology, to stand down the special interest groups  can you imagine taking Medicaid from 10 to 2.5 percent?We can take many of those same procedures, we can apply it to Medicare. We can make a stronger program. But I agree with Jeb, you cant just do this by growing the economy. You cant grow your way out of demographics.But we can give people better health care. And finally, on health care, why dont we start treating  keep giving...QUICK: Governor.KASICH: ...incentives for people to keep people healthy, rather than giving the incentives to treat them when theyre sick?QUICK: Governor, thank you.Senator Paul, lets go back to you. Do these solutions sound like they work?PAUL: Say again?QUICK: Do these solutions sound like they would work?PAUL: You cant do nothing. And thats what I hear from some people, well do nothing and it will just be fixed. Thats absurd, and I think people who dont want to fix it, really, or unwilling to take the chance to say, something has to change, are missing the boat here.The age will have to gradually rise, there is no question. Its the only way you fix Medicare, the only way you fix Social Security. You will also have to means-test the benefits and declare theres not enough money.It isnt I put money in, Im getting it back. There is no money, its a stack of paper. There is no money in the Social Security account. There is no money in the Medicare account. Theres only a promise to pay by the next generation, and the next generations not big enough to pay it.(CROSSTALK)(UNKNOWN): ...to deal with this. We did it 200 days ago.HARWOOD: Hold on, Governor. Ive got a question for  for Dr. Carson.CARSON: About Medicare?HARWOOD: Yes. Youve said that you would like to replace Medicare with a system of individual family savings accounts, so that families could cover their own expenses.Obviously, that would be a very controversial idea. Explain how that would work, exactly.CARSON: Well, first of all the  the plan gives people the option of  of opting out. But I think they will see a very good option here. You know, the annual Medicare budget is over $600 billion. And there are 48 million people involved  40 million, 65 and over, and 8 million other.Divide that out. That comes out to $12,500 for each one. Now, I can tell you there are a lot of private-sector things that you could do with $12,500, which will get you a lot more than you get from this government program.And thats really a theme of a lot of the things that Im talking about. How do we utilize our intellect rather than allowing the government to use its, quote, intellect, in order to help us to be able to live healthier and better lives?It was never intended that the government should be in every aspect of our lives. This is a country that is of, for and by the people.QUICK: Thank you, Dr. Carson.Governor?CHRISTIE: And  and  and I  you know, Ben is absolutely right in saying that what we dont need to do is to send more money to Washington, D.C. to fix this problem.And thats what youll hear from Hillary Clinton  and Ive already heard from her  is that, send more money in Social Security, send more money in Medicare taxes, send more money for Medicaid, and thats gonna solve the problem.What we know is were living longer. Thats a blessing. Its a blessing that were living longer, so we have to increase the retirement age to reflect that blessing.We need to make sure that people understand, as Jeb said before, that if youve done extraordinarily well in this country, do you want them to take more out of your taxes now and think theyre gonna give it back to you later? Or would you rather take less later on?QUINTANILLA: Senator Rubio...HARWOOD: Governor, do you also think that...QUINTANILLA: ...yeah, I just wanted (inaudible).HARWOOD: ...that Dr. Carsons right, that we can replace Medicare with individual savings accounts?RUBIO: No. No. What I said was that I think that Dr. Carsons ideas are good ideas. Theyre not my ideas, and I dont necessarily agree with all of them.But this is what youre seeing in the Republican debate that you didnt see in that Democrat debate.You didnt see it for a minute. You didnt see these kind of ideas being batted around, and being batted around in a way thats civil and smart and thats trying to help to inform the voter out there.What you saw was a parade of, Ill give you this for free; Ill give you that for free.Let me tell you, everybody, when they say they want to give it to you for free, keep your hands on your wallets because theyre coming to you to pay for it. And thats why I think these ideas up here are great, and thats what we should have is have more discussions like this and less gotcha.(CROSSTALK)QUINTANILLA: I want to give you 30 seconds here.RUBIO: I want to take off from that point and argue the same thing. And that is that one of the things youre watching tonight are 11 quality candidates debating an important issue. The Republican Party is blessed to have 11 good candidates, (inaudible) 10 good candidates. The Democrats cant even come up with one.And on this issue of the Medicare in particular, its important because theyre going to demagogue what were saying here tonight. Everyone up here tonight thats talking about reforms, I think and I know for myself I speak to this, were all talking about reforms for future generations. Nothing has to change for current beneficiaries. My mother is on Medicare and Social Security. Im against anything thats bad for my mother.(LAUGHTER)So, were talking about  were talking about reform for people like me and people like Senator Cruz, as he talked about earlier, who are years away from retirement that have a way to plan for these changes, and way thats very reasonable. And its not too much to ask of our generation after everything our parents and our grandparents did for us.FIORINA: John, I  if I  a lot of people have jumped in here. Id like to jump in. A lot of people have jumped in here.HARWOOD: Mrs. Fiorina, were right at the end of our time.FIORINA: I understand.HARWOOD: You all wanted us to limit (inaudible).All right. Go ahead.FIORINA: I would just say that...(LAUGHTER)... I would just say this, weve heard a lot of great ideas up here, and I agree with what Senator Rubio said. Every election we talk about this. Every election we talk about Medicare and Social Security reform. It never happens.I would like to start with a basic. Let us actually go to zero- based budgeting so we know where the money is being spent. Its kind of basic. There is a bill sitting in the House that would actually pass and have us go to zero-based budgeting so we know where every dime of your money is being spent instead of only talking about how much more were going to spend year after year after year.My point is this. While there are lots of good ideas for reform, we have never tackled the basics. And we finally need to tackle the basics to cut this government down to size and hold it accountable. So lets start by knowing where your money is being spent by the federal government.HARWOOD: We have now reached the point in the program where candidates are going to give their closing statements, 30 seconds apiece. Were going to go right to left and start with you, Senator Paul.PAUL: Liberty thrives when government is small. I want a government so small I can barely see it. I want a government so small that the individual has a chance to thrive and prosper. I think, though, government is too big now. And what youre going to see in Washington this week is establishment Republicans have made an agreement with the president to raise the debt ceiling in an unlimited fashion; no limit to the debt ceiling raise.This is extraordinary. Its extraordinarily wrong. Youll see me on the floor of the Senate tomorrow filibustering this and saying enough is enough, no more debt.HARWOOD: Governor Christie?CHRISTIE: I want to talk to the folks at home. I want to ask you: Are you fed up with how Washington taxes you? Are you fed up with how Washington wastes your money? Are you concerned like I am that the debt and deficits of Washington, D.C. are endangering Americas future?Ive got one more question for you then. Are you serious about this election? Because if you are, you need to elect someone whos deadly serious about changing this culture. I am deadly serious about changing this culture. I changed it in New Jersey. Im deadly serious about doing this job the right way.Im prepared. Im tested. Im ready. And I want to make this our government. For the people who say we cant do it, I say hell no, we can do it together.HARWOOD: Thank you, Governor.Senator Cruz?CRUZ: You know, everyone here talks about the need to take on Washington. The natural next question is who actually has done so. Who actually has stood up not just to Democrats, but to leaders in our own party? When millions of Americans rose up against Obamacare, I was proud to lead that fight. When millions of Americans rose up against amnesty, I was proud to lead that fight. When millions of Americans rose up against Planned Parenthood, I was proud to lead that fight.If people are promising theyre going to take on Washington and cronyism, you need to look to who has been doing it. In my family, my dad fled oppression in Cuba to come to America. Freedom is personal for me, and I will always keep my word and fight for freedom.HARWOOD: Thank you, Senator.Mrs. Fiorina?FIORINA: You know, every election we hear a lot of talk. We hear a lot of good plans. We hear actually a lot of good intentions. But somehow for decades, nothing really has changed. What we need now is a proven leader who has produced results. Thats how you go from secretary to CEO. You lead and you produce results. I will cut this government down to size and hold it accountable, simplify the tax code, roll back the regulations that have been spewing out of Washington, D.C. for 50 years.I may not be your dream candidate just yet, but I can assure you I am Hillary Clintons worst nightmare. And in your heart of hearts, you cannot wait to see a debate between Hillary Clinton and Carly Fiorina. I will tell you this, I will beat Hillary Clinton. And with your vote and your support and your prayers, I will lead with the citizens of this great nation the resurgence of this great nation.HARMAN: Thank you, Mrs. Fiorina.Dr. Carson?CARSON: I just want to thank all my colleagues here for being civil, and not falling for the traps. And, I also just want to thank the audience for being attentive, and noticing the questions, and the noticing the answers. And, this is what I am finding throughout America.People are waking up because it is going to be us who will determine the direction of our country. And, it was made for we the people, we are the ones who decide who we are, and we should never give away the values and principles that made America into a great nation for the sake of political correctness.(APPLAUSE)HARWOOD: Mr. Trump?TRUMP: Our country doesnt win anymore. We used to win, we dont win anymore. We lose on trade. We lose with ISIS. We lose with one of the worst deals Ive ever seen negotiated of any kind, thats our recent catastrophe with Iran. We dont win.Let me give you one quick example. These folks, CNBC, they had it down at three, three and a half hours. I just read today in the New York Times, $250,000 for a 30 second ad. I went out and said, its ridiculous. Nobody  I could stand up here all night. Nobody wants to watch three and a half, or three hours. It was a back sacrifice, and I have to hand it to Ben.We called Ben, he was with me 100%. We called in, we said, thats it. Were not doing it. They lost a lot of money, everybody said it couldnt be done. Everybody said it was going to be three hours, three and a half, including them, and in about two minutes I renegotiated it so we can get the hell out of here. Not bad.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: And, Ill do that with the country. We will make America great again. And, thank you everybody. Just for the record.HARWOOD: Just for the record, the debate was always going to be two hours. Senator Rubio?TRUMP: Thats not right. That is absolutely not right. You know that. That is not right.MALE: Thank you.HARWOOD: Senator Rubio.RUBIO: You know, America doesnt owe me anything. I have a debt to America Ill never repay. This isnt just the country I was born in, this is the nation that literally changed the history of my family. My parents in this country were able to give me the chance to do all the things they never did. We call that the American Dream, although, its built on the universal dream of a better life.The fact that its happened for so many people here throughout our history, thats what makes us special. But, now for millions of Americans, its slipping away. And, we have a government and leaders in government that are completely out of touch, and thats why Im running for president. Because we cant just save the American Dream, we can expand it to reach more people, and change more lives than ever before.And, thats why tonight Im asking you for your vote.HARWOOD: Thank you, Senator. Governor Bush?BUSH: Americas at a crossroads. The D.C. politicians continue to make things worse. I have a proven record of success, 32 years in business, and 8 years as Governor of the state of Florida.I will change the culture in Washington, just as I changed the culture in Tallahassee. I will do so in a way that will bring people together. We need a unifier, not a cynical divider in chief, and thats exactly what I will do.Imagine a country where people are lifted out of poverty again. Imagine a country where the middle class can get rising income again. I know we can do this because were still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.HARWOOD: Thank you, Governor. Governor Huckabee.HUCKABEE: You know, I know to a lot of people in the media, this is just a great big game, and were the players. And, we come out here, and we do our thing. And, sometimes were held up in contempt by people who write columns, but, I guarantee you to every person on this stage theres something deep inside of us that would cause us to give up our livelihoods and step out on this stage and fight for the people of America.Ive got five grandkids. I do not want to walk my five grandkids through the charred remains of a once great country called America, and say, Here you go, $20 trillion dollars of debt. Good luck making something out of this mess.And, for those of us who are serious enough to run for president, think long and hard why were here, and hopefully youll know were not here for ourselves. We honest to god are here to get this country back on track. I know this, I certainly am.HARWOOD: Thank you...HUCKABEE: ...Thank you.HARWOOD: Governor Kasich?KASICH: I was on morning Joe at a town hall and a young student stood up and said, Can I still be idealistic?I said, absolutely, you can still change the world. And, you know the old inscription, if you save one life, youve changed the world. Folks, we have a problem here with the leadership in Washington, but Ill tell you another problem. We need to rebuild our families. We need to have stronger families. We need to know who our neighbors are. We need to come together as a country because we have to realize that America is great, not from the top-down. Oh yeah, we want to elect a good president, but America is great from the bottom-up, and the bottom-up is us in our families, in our communities, in our neighborhoods. We will renew America if we work together, and I am totally confident that we will. And God bless America.(APPLAUSE)HARWOOD: Thank you, Governor.QUINTANILLA: That concludes tonights debate. On behalf of my colleagues Becky Quick, John Harwood, Sharon Epperson, Rick Santelli and Jim Cramer, wed like to our host, the University of Colorado at Boulder, the Republican National Committee, the candidates and, of course," tonights audience.CNBCs Kelly Evans and Joe Kernan pick up our continuing coverage.END""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
20,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/15/us/politics/transcript-of-republican-presidential-debate.html,1/15/16,"Following is a transcript of the main Republican presidential debate, as transcribed by the Federal News Service.NEIL CAVUTO: It is 9:00 p.m. here at the North Charleston Coliseum and Performing Arts Center in South Carolina. Welcome to the sixth Republican presidential debate of the 2016 campaign, here on the Fox Business Network.Im Neil Cavuto, alongside my friend and co-moderator Maria Bartiromo.MARIA BARTIROMO: Tonight we are working with Facebook to ask the candidates the questions voters want answered. And according to Facebook, the U.S. election has dominated the global conversation, with 131 million people talking about the 2016 race. That makes it the number one issue talked about on Facebook last year worldwide.CAVUTO: Now, the seven candidates on the stage tonight were selected based on their standing in six national polls, as well as polls in the early-voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire, those standings determining the position on the stage of the candidates tonight. And here they are.Businessman Donald Trump.(APPLAUSE)Texas senator Ted Cruz.(APPLAUSE)Florida senator Marco Rubio.(APPLAUSE)Neurosurgeon Ben Carson.(APPLAUSE)New Jersey governor Chris Christie.(APPLAUSE)Former Florida governor Jeb Bush.And Ohio governor John Kasich.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Tonights rules are simple: up to 90 seconds for each answer, one minute for each follow-up response. And if a candidate goes over the allotted time, youll hear this.(BELL RINGS) So lets get started. Candidates, jobs and growth  two of the biggest issues facing the country right now. In his State of the Union address earlier this week, the president said, quote, we have the strongest, most durable economy in the world.And according to our Facebook research, jobs is one of the biggest issues resonating across the country, including here in South Carolina. The president is touting 14 million new jobs and an unemployment rate cut in half.The president said that anyone who claims Americas economy is in decline is peddling fiction. Senator Cruz, what do you see that he doesnt?CRUZ: Well, Maria, thank you for that question, and let me say thank you to the state of South Carolina for welcoming us.Let me start  I want to get to the substance of the question on jobs, but I want to start with something. Today, many of us picked up our newspapers, and we were horrified to see the sight of 10 American sailors on their knees, with their hands on their heads.In that State of the Union, President Obama didnt so much as mention the 10 sailors that had been captured by Iran. President Obamas preparing to send $100 billion or more to the Ayatollah Khamenei. And Ill tell you, it was heartbreaking.But the good news is the next commander-in-chief is standing on this stage. (APPLAUSE)And I give you my word, if I am elected president, no service man or service woman will be forced to be on their knees, and any nation that captures our fighting men will feel the full force and fury of the United States of America.(APPLAUSE)Now, on to your substantive question. The president tried to paint a rosy picture of jobs. And you know, hes right. If youre a Washington lobbyist, if you make your money in and around Washington, things are doing great. The millionaires and billionaires are doing great under Obama. But we have the lowest percentage of Americans working today of any year since 1977. Median wages have stagnated. And the Obama-Clinton economy has left behind the working men and women of this country.The reason all of us are here is we believe we should be fighting for the working men and women of this country, and not Washington, D.C.BARTIROMO: Thank you, sir.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Governor Kasich, we are not even two weeks into this stock trading year, but (inaudible) investors already lost $1.6 trillion in market value. That makes it the worst start to a new year ever. Many worry that things will get even worse, and that banks and financial stocks are particularly vulnerable.Now, if this escalates, like it did back when Barack Obama first assumed the presidency, what actions would you take if this same thing happens all over again just as, in this example, you are taking over the presidency?KASICH: Look, it takes three things basically to grow jobs. And Ive done it when I was in Washington when we had a balanced budget; had four years of balanced budgets; paid down a half-trillion of debt. And our economy was growing like crazy. Its the same thing that I did in Ohio. Its a simple formula: common sense regulations, which is why I think we should freeze all federal regulations for one year, except for health and safety. It requires tax cuts, because that sends a message to the job creators that things are headed the right way. And if you tax cuts  if you cut taxes for corporations, and you cut taxes for individuals, youre going to make things move, particularly the corporate tax, which is the highest, of course, in the  in the world.But in addition to that, we have to have fiscal discipline. We have to show that we can march to a balanced budget. And when you do that, when youre in a position of managing regulations; when you reduce taxes; and when you have fiscal discipline, you see the job creators begin to get very comfortable with the fact that they can invest.Right now, you dont have the  you have taxes that are too high. You have regulations  I mean, come on, theyre affecting everybody here, particularly our small businesses. They are  theyre in a position where theyre smothering people. And I mean, are you kidding me? Were nowhere close to a balanced budget or fiscal discipline.Those three things put together are going to give confidence to job creators and you will begin to see wages rise. You will begin to see jobs created in a robust economy. And how do I know it? Because Ive done it. I did it as the chairman of the Budget Committee, working with Senator Domenici. And Ive done it in the state of Ohio as the chief executive.Our wages are growing faster than the national average. Were running surpluses. And we can take that message and that formula to Washington to lift every single American to a better life.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: We know that recent global events have many people worried  Iran detaining American sailors, forcing them to apologize; North Korea and its nuclear ambitions; an aggressive China; and a Middle East that continues to deteriorate, not to mention ISIS is getting stronger.Governor Christie, sometimes it seems the world is on fire. Where and when should a president use military action to restore order?CHRISTIE: Well, Maria, Im glad to have heard from you in the summary of that question about whats going on in the world. Because Tuesday night, I watched story time with Barack Obama. And Ive got to tell you, it sounded like everything in the world was going amazing, you know?(APPLAUSE)The fact is, theres a number of things that the next president is going to have to do to clean up this mess. The first thing is we have to strengthen our alliances around the world. And the best way to do that is to start talking to our allies again and having them be able to count on our word.Lots of people will say lots of different things about me in this campaign and others, but the one thing theyve never said about me is that Im misunderstood. And so when we talk to our allies and we give them our word, in a Christie administration, they know were going to keep it.Next, we have to talk to our adversaries, and we have to make sure they understand the limits of our patience. And this president, given what Ted said right at the beginning, hes absolutely right. Its a  its absolutely disgraceful that Secretary Kerry and others said in their response to whats going on in Iran that this was a good thing; it showed how the relationship was getting better.The president doesnt understand  and by the way, neither does Secretary Clinton  and heres my warning to everybody out in the audience tonight. If youre worried about the world being on fire, youre worried about how were going to use our military, youre worried about strengthening our military and youre worried most of all about keeping your homes and your families safe and secure, you cannot give Hillary Clinton a third term of Barack Obamas leadership.I will not do that. If Im the nominee, she wont get within 10 miles of the White House.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Just to be clear Governor, where and when would you use military action?CHRISTIE: MIlitary action, Maria, would be used when it was absolutely necessary to protect American lives and protect American interests around the world. We are not the worlds policeman, but we need to stand up and be ready.And the problem, Maria, is that the military is not ready, either. We need to rebuild our military, and this president has let it diminish to a point where tinpot dictators like the mullahs in Iran are taking our Navy ships. It is disgraceful, and in a Christie administration, they would know much, much better than to do that.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Governor Bush, the president just told the nation two nights ago that America is back and that the idea that our enemies are getting stronger or that this country is getting weaker, well, its just rhetoric and hot air. Now other Democrats go even further, sir, saying Republicans even suggesting such comments actually embolden our enemies. I guess they would include you. What do you say?BUSH: Well first of all, the idea that somehow were better off today than the day that Barack Obama was inaugurated president of the United States is totally an alternative universe. The simple fact is that the world has been torn asunder.Think about it. With grandiose language, the president talks about red lines and nothing to follow it up; talks about ISIS being the JV team, they form a caliphate the size of Indiana with 35 (thousand) to 40,000 battle-tested terrorists. Hes missing the whole point, that Americas leadership in the world is required for peace and stability.In the crowd today is Major General James Livingston, whos the co-chairman of my campaign here in South Carolina, a Medal of Honor recipient.(APPLAUSE)Ive learned from him that what we need to achieve is peace through strength, which means we need to rebuild the military. In this administration, every weapon system has been gutted, in this administration, the force levels are going down to a level where we cant even project force. Our friends no longer think we have their back and our enemies no longer fear us, and were in a much difficult  were in a much different position than we should be.And for the life of me, I have no understanding why the president thinks that everything is going well. Terrorism is on the run, China, Russia is advancing their agenda at warp speed, and we pull back.As president of the United States, I will be a commander in chief that will have the back of the military. We will rebuild the military to make sure that it is a solid force, not to be the worlds policeman, but to make sure that in a peaceful world, people know that the United States is there to take care of our own national interests and take care of our allies.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: So I take it from that you do not agree with the president.BUSH: No. And worse  worse yet, to be honest with you, Hillary Clinton would be a national security disaster.Think about it. She wants to continue down the path of Iran, Benghazi, the Russian reset, Dodd-Frank, all the things that have  that have gone wrong in this country, she would be a national security mess. And that is wrong.And you know what? Heres the problem. If she gets elected, shes under investigation with the FBI right now. If she gets elected, her first 100 days, instead of setting an agenda, she might be going back and forth between the White House and the courthouse. We need to stop that. (LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Senator Rubio, the president says that ISIS doesnt threaten our national existence like a Germany or a Japan back in World War II, that the terror group is nothing more than twisted souls plotting attacks in their garages.But House Homeland Security Committee recently said that over 1,000 ongoing investigations of homegrown extremism in 50 states. So how do you define the threat? Germany then or dangerous nut cases now?RUBIO: Yeah, I would go, first of all, one step further in this description of Hillary Clinton. She wouldnt just be a disaster, Hillary Clinton is disqualified from being commander in chief of the United States.(APPLAUSE)Someone who cannot handle intelligence information appropriately cannot be commander in chief and someone who lies to the families of those four victims in Benghazi can never be president of the United States. Ever.(APPLAUSE)On the issue of Barack Obama, Barack Obama does not believe that America is a great global power. Barack Obama believes that America is a arrogant global power that needs to be cut down to size. And thats how you get a foreign policy where we cut deals with our enemies like Iran and we betray our allies like Israel and we gut our military and we go around the world like he has done on 10 separate occasions and apologized for America.He doesnt understand the threat in ISIS. He consistently underestimates it but I do not. There is a war against ISIS, not just against ISIS but against radical jihadists terrorists, and it is a war that they win or we win.When Im president of the United States, we are going to win this war on ISIS. The most powerful intelligence agency in the world is going to tell us where we are, the most powerful military in the world is going to destroy them. And if we capture any of them alive, they are getting a one-way ticket to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we are going to find out everything they know.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Thank you, Senator.BARTIROMO: Dr. Carson, the president says he does not want to treat ISIS as a foreign army, but ISIS is neither a country nor a government. How do you attack a network that does not respect national borders?CARSON: Well, Im very happy to get a question this early on. I was going to ask you to wake me up when that time came.(LAUGHTER)You know, I find it really quite fascinating some of the presidents proclamations. The fact of the matter is he doesnt realize that we now live in the 21st century, and that war is very different than it used to be before. Not armies massively marching on each other and air forces, but now we have dirty bombs and we have cyber attacks and we have people who will be attacking our electrical grid. And, you know, we have a whole variety of things that they can do and they can do these things simultaneously. And we have enemies who are obtaining nuclear weapons that they can explode in our exoatmosphere and destroy our electric grid.I mean, just think about a scenario like that. They explode the bomb, we have an electromagnetic pulse. They hit us with a cyberattack simultaneously and dirty bombs. Can you imagine the chaos that would ensue at that point? He needs to recognize that those kinds of things are in fact an existential threat to us.But heres the real key. We have the worlds best military, even though hes done everything he can to diminish it. And the fact of the matter is if we give them a mission and we dont tie their hands behind their back, they can get it accomplished.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Mr. Trump, at the State of the Union, the president pointed to a guest who was a Syrian refugee you might recall whose wife and daughter and other family members were killed in an air attack. Now he fled that country seeking asylum here, ultimately ended up in Detroit where hes now trying to start a new life.The president says that that doctor is the real face of these refugees and not the one that you and some of your colleagues on this stage are painting; that you prefer the face of fear and terror and that you would refuse to let in anyone into this country seeking legitimate asylum. How do you answer that?TRUMP: Its not fear and terror, its reality. You just have to look today at Indonesia, bombings all over.(APPLAUSE)You look at California, you look, frankly, at Paris where theres a  the strictest no-gun policy of any city anywhere in the world, and you see what happens: 130 people dead with many to follow. Theyre very, very badly wounded. They will  some will follow. And you look around, and you see whats happening, and this is not the case when he introduced the doctor  very nice, everything perfect but that is not representative of what you have in that line of migration.That could be the great Trojan Horse. It could be people that are going to do great, great destruction. When I look at the migration, I looked at the line, I said it actually on your show recently, where are the women? It looked like very few women. Very few children. Strong, powerful men, young and people are looking at that and theyre saying whats going on?You look at the kind of damage that two people that two people that got married, they were radicalized  they got married, they killed 15 people in actually 15  going to be probably 16 but you look at that and you take a look  a good strong look and thats what we have. We are nineteen trillion dollars  our countrys a mess and we cant let all these people come into our country and break our borders. We cant do it.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Senator Cruz, the New York Times is reporting that you failed to properly disclose a million dollars in loans from Goldman Sachs and CitiBank. During your senate race, your campaign said, it was inadvertent. A million dollars is inadvertent?CRUZ: Well Maria, thank you for passing on that hit piece in the front page of the New York Times. You know the nice thing about the mainstream media, they dont hide their views. The New York Times a few weeks back had a columnist who wrote a column saying, Anybody But Cruz. Had that actually  that same columnist wrote a column comparing me to an evil demonic spirit from the move, It Follows that jumps apparently from body to body possessing people.So you know the New York Times and I dont have exactly have the warmest of relationships. Now in terms of their really stunning hit piece, what they mentioned is when I was running for senate  unlike Hillary Clinton, I dont have masses of money in the bank, hundreds of millions of dollars. When I was running for senate just about every lobbyist, just about all of the establishment opposed me in the senate race in Texas and my opponent in that race was worth over 200 million dollars. He put a 25 million dollar check up from his own pocket to fund that campaign and my wife Heidi and I, we ended up investing everything we owned.We took a loan against our assets to invest it in that campaign to defend ourselves against those attacks. And the entire New York times attack  is that I disclosed that loan on one filing with the United States Senate, that was a public filing. But it was not on a second filing with FDIC and yes, I made a paperwork error disclosing it on one piece of paper instead of the other. But if thats the best the New York Times has got, they better go back to the well. BARTIROMO: Thank you.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CAVUTO: All right. Welcome back to the Republican presidential debate, right here in North Charleston, South Carolina. Lets get right back to the questions. And Ill start with you, Senator Cruz.Now you are, of course, a strict constitutionalist  no one would doubt that. And as you know, the U.S. Constitution says only natural-born citizens are eligible for the office of president of the United States. Stop me if youve heard this before. Now, you were born...(LAUGHTER)... you were born in Canada to an American mother. So you were and are considered an American citizen. But that fellow next to you, Donald Trump  and others  have said that being born in Canada means you are not natural-born, and that has raised questions about your eligibility.Do you want to try to close this topic once and for all tonight?CRUZ: Well, Neil, Im glad were focusing on the important topics of the evening.(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)You know, back in September, my friend Donald said that he had had his lawyers look at this from every which way, and there was no issue there. There was nothing to this birther issue.(LAUGHTER)Now, since September, the Constitution hasnt changed.(LAUGHTER)But the poll numbers have.(APPLAUSE)And I recognize  I recognize that Donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in Iowa. But the facts and the law here are really quite clear. Under longstanding U.S. law, the child of a U.S. citizen born abroad is a natural-born citizen.If a soldier has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen. Thats why John McCain, even though he was born in Panama, was eligible to run for president.If an American missionary has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen. Thats why George Romney, Mitts dad, was eligible to run for president, even though he was born in Mexico.At the end of the day, the legal issue is quite straightforward, but I would note that the birther theories that Donald has been relying on  some of the more extreme ones insist that you must not only be born on U.S. soil, but have two parents born on U.S. soil.Under that theory, not only would I be disqualified, Marco Rubio would be disqualified, Bobby Jindal would be disqualified and, interestingly enough, Donald J. Trump would be disqualified.(APPLAUSE)(UNKNOWN): Not me.CRUZ: Because  because Donalds mother was born in Scotland. She was naturalized. Now, Donald...TRUMP: But I was born here.CRUZ: ... on the issue  on the issue of citizenship, Donald...TRUMP: (inaudible). Big difference.CRUZ: ... on the issue of citizenship, Donald, Im not going to use your mothers birth against you.TRUMP: OK, good. Because it wouldnt work.CRUZ: Youre an American, as is everybody else on this stage, and I would suggest we focus on whos best prepared to be commander- in-chief, because thats the most important question facing the country.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Mr. Trump...(CROSSTALK)CAVUTO: ... that you raised it because of his rising poll numbers.TRUMP: ... first of all, let me just tell you something  and you know, because you just saw the numbers yourself  NBC Wall Street Journal just came out with a poll  headline: Trump way up, Cruz going down. I mean, so dont  so you cant  you cant...(BOOING)... they dont like the Wall Street Journal. They dont like NBC, but I like the poll.(LAUGHTER)And frankly, it just came out, and in Iowa now, as you know, Ted, in the last three polls, Im beating you. So  you know, you shouldnt misrepresent how well youre doing with the polls.(APPLAUSE)You dont have to say that. In fact, I was all for you until you started doing that, because thats a misrepresentation, number one.Number two, this isnt me saying it. I dont care. I think Im going to win fair and square (inaudible) to win this way. Thank you.Lawrence Tribe and (inaudible) from Harvard  of Harvard, said that there is a serious question as to whether or not Ted can do this. OK? There are other attorneys that feel, and very, very fine constitutional attorneys, that feel that because he was not born on the land, he cannot run for office.Heres the problem. Were running. Were running. He does great. I win. I choose him as my vice presidential candidate, and the Democrats sue because we cant take him along for the ride. I dont like that. OK?(LAUGHTER)The fact is  and if for some reason he beats the rest of the field, he beats the rest of the field (inaudible). See, they dont like that. They dont like that.(AUDIENCE BOOING)No, they dont like he beats the rest of the field, because they want me.(LAUGHTER)But  if for some reason, Neil, he beats the rest of the field, I already know the Democrats are going to be bringing a suit. You have a big lawsuit over your head while youre running. And if you become the nominee, who the hell knows if you can even serve in office? So you should go out, get a declaratory judgment, let the courts decide. And you shouldnt have mentioned the polls because I would have been much...(CROSSTALK)CAVUTO: Why are you saying this now  right now? Why are you raising this issue now?TRUMP: Because now hes going a little bit better. No, I didnt care (inaudible). Its true. No, its true. Hey look, he never had a chance. Now, hes doing better. Hes got probably a four or five percent chance.(LAUGHTER)(CROSSTALK)CRUZ: Neil...(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: The fact is, there is a big overhang. Theres a big question mark on your head. And you cant do that to the party. You really cant. You cant do that to the party. You have to have certainty. Even if it was a one percent chance, and its far greater than one percent because (inaudible).I mean, you have great constitutional lawyers that say you cant run. If there was a  and you know Im not bringing a suit. I promise. But the Democrats are going to bring a lawsuit, and you have to have certainty. You cant have a question. I can agree with you or not, but you cant have a question over your head.CAVUTO: Senator, do you want to respond?CRUZ: Well, listen, Ive spent my entire life defending the Constitution before the U.S. Supreme Court. And Ill tell you, Im not going to be taking legal advice from Donald Trump.TRUMP: You dont have to. Take it from Lawrence Tribe.(APPLAUSE)(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: Take it from your professors...(CROSSTALK)CRUZ: The chances of any litigation proceeding and succeeding on this are zero. And Mr. Trump is very focused...TRUMP: Hes wrong. Hes wrong.CRUZ: ... on Larry Tribe. Let me tell you who Larry Tribe is. Hes a left-wing judicial activist, Harvard Law professor who was Al Gores lawyer in Bush versus Gore. Hes a major Hillary Clinton supporter. And theres a reason why Hillarys supporters are echoing Donalds attacks on me, because Hillary...TRUMP: He is not the only one.CRUZ: ... wants to face Donald Trump in the general election.TRUMP: There are many lawyers.CRUZ: And Ill tell you what, Donald, you  you very kindly just a moment ago offered me the V.P. slot.(LAUGHTER) Ill tell you what. If this all works out, Im happy to consider naming you as V.P. So if you happen to be right, you could get the top job at the end of the day.TRUMP: No  no...(LAUGHTER)... I think if it doesnt...(APPLAUSE)I like that. I like it. Id consider it. But I think Ill go back to building buildings if it doesnt work out.CRUZ: Actually, Id love to get you to build a wall.(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: I have a feeling its going to work out, actually.(CROSSTALK)RUBIO: Let me (inaudible). I was invoked in that question, so let me just say  in that answer  let me say, the real question here, I hate to interrupt this episode of Court TV.(LAUGHTER)But the real  but I think we have to get back to what this election has to be about. OK? Listen, we  this is the greatest country in the history of mankind. But in 2008, we elected a president that didnt want to fix America. He wants to change America. We elected a president that doesnt believe in the Constitution. He undermines it. We elected a president that is weakening America on the global stage. We elected a president that doesnt believe in the free enterprise system.This election has to be about reversing all of that damage. Thats why Im running for office because when I become president of the United States, on my first day in office we are going to repeal every single one of his unconstitutional executive orders. When Im president of the United States we are getting rid of Obamacare and we are rebuilding our military. And when Im president, were not just going to have a president that gives a State of the Union and says America is the greatest country in the world. When Im president, were going to have a president that acts like it.BARTIROMO: Thank you, senator.BARTIROMO: Mr. Trump, South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley in her response to the State of the Union address(APPLAUSE)BARITROMO: appeared to choose sides within the party, saying Republicans should resist, quote, the siren call of the angriest voices. She confirmed, she was referring to you among others. Was she out of line? And, how would a President Trump unite the party?TRUMP: Okay. First of all, Nikki this afternoon said Im a friend of hers. Actually a close friend. And wherever you are sitting Nikki, Im a friend. Were friends. Thats good.(LAUGHTER)But she did say there was anger. And I could say, oh, Im not angry. Im very angry because our country is being run horribly and I will gladly accept the mantle of anger. Our military is a disaster.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: Our healthcare is a horror show. Obamacare, were going to repeal it and replace it. We have no borders. Our vets are being treated horribly. Illegal immigration is beyond belief. Our country is being run by incompetent people. And yes, I am angry.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: And I wont be angry when we fix it, but until we fix it, Im very, very angry. And I say that to Nikki. So when Nikki said that, I wasnt offended. She said the truth.One of your colleagues interviewed me. And said, well, she said you were angry and I said to myself, huh, shes right. Im not fighting that. I didnt find it offensive at all. Im angry because our country is a mess.(APPLAUSE)BARITROMO: But what are you going to do about it?CAVUTO: Marco Rubio. Im sorry, its the time constraints. You and Governor Christie have been exchanging some fairly nasty words of late, and I will allow the governor to respond as well.The governor went so far to say, you wont be able to slime your way to the White House. Hes referring to a series of ads done by a PAC, speaking on your behalf, that say quote,One high tax, Common Core, liberal, energy-loving, Obamacare, Medicaid-expanding president is enough. You think you went too far on that and do you want to apologize to the governor?RUBIO: You know, as I said already twice in this debate, we have a very serious problem in this country.(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: We have a president of the United States that is undermining this countrys security and expanding the role of...CAVUTO: That is not my question.RUBIO: Well, I am going to answer your question, Neil. He is  this president is undermining the constitutional basis of this government. This president is undermining our military. He is undermining our standing in the world. I like Chris Christie, but we can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports Common Core.(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: We can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports gun control. This president, this president is more interested in funding  less interested in funding the military, than he is in funding planned  hes more interested in funding Planned Parenthood than he is in funding the military.Chris Christie wrote a check to Planned Parenthood. All Im saying is our next president has to be someone that undoes the damage Barack Obama has done to this country. It can not be someone that agrees with his agenda.Because the damage he has done to America is extraordinary. Let me tell you, if we dont get this election right, there may be no turning back for America. Were on the verge of being the first generation of Americans",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that leave our children worse off than ourselves.So I just truly, with all my heart belief, I like everybody on the stage. No one is a socialist. No one here is under FBI investigation. So we have a good group of people.CAVUTO: Is he a liberal?RUBIO: Our next president...CAVUTO: Is he a liberal?RUBIO: Unfortunately, Governor Christie has endorsed many of the ideas that Barack Obama supports, whether it is Common Core or gun control or the appointment of Sonia Sotomayor or the donation he made to Planned Parenthood. Our next president, and our Republican nominee can not be someone who supports those positions.CAVUTO: Governor?(APPLAUSE)CHRISTIE: I stood on the stage and watched Marco in rather indignantly, look at Governor Bush and say, someone told you that because were running for the same office, that criticizing me will get you to that office.It appears that the same someone who has been whispering in old Marcos ear too.(LAUGHTER)So the indignation that you carry on, some of the stuff, you have to also own then. So lets set the facts straight. First of all, I didnt support Sonia Sotomayor. Secondly, I never wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.Third, if you look at my record as governor of New Jersey, I have vetoed a 50-caliber rifle ban. I have vetoed a reduction this clip size. I vetoed a statewide I.D. system for gun owners and I pardoned, six out-of-state folks who came through our state and were arrested for owning a gun legally in another state so they never have to face charges.And on Common Core, Common Core has been eliminated in New Jersey. So listen, this is the difference between being a governor and a senator. See when youre a senator, what you get to do is just talk and talk and talk. And you talk so much that nobody can ever keep up with what youre saying is accurate or not.When youre a governor, youre held accountable for everything you do. And the people of New Jersey, Ive seen it.(APPLAUSE)And the last piece is this. I like Marco too, and two years ago, he called me a conservative reformer that New Jersey needed. That was before he was running against me. Now that he is, hes changed his tune.Im never going to change my tune. I like Marco Rubio. Hes a good guy, a smart guy, and he would be a heck of a lot better president than Hillary Rodham Clinton would ever be.(APPLAUSE)BUSH: Neil, my name was mentioned here. Neil, my name was mentioned as well.Heres the deal, Chris is totally right. Hes been a good governor, and hes a heck of a lot better than his predecessor that would have bankrupted New Jersey.Everybody on this stage is better than Hillary Clinton. And I think the focus ought to be on making sure that we leave this nomination process, as wild and woolly as its going to be  this is not being bad.These attack ads are going to be part of life. Everybody just needs to get used to it. Everybodys records going to be scrutinized, and at the end of the day we need to unite behind the winner so we can defeat Hillary Clinton, because she is a disaster.(APPLAUSE)Our country rise up again, but we need to have a compelling conservative agenda that we present to the American people in a way that doesnt disparage people, that unites us around our common purpose.And so everybody needs to discount some of the things youre going to hear in these ads, and discount the  the back-and-forth here, because every person here is better than Hillary Clinton.CARSON: Neil, I was mentioned too.CAVUTO: You were?CARSON: Yeah, he said everybody. (LAUGHTER)And  and I just want to take this opportunity to say, you know, in the 2012 election, you know, we  and when I say we, Republicans  tore themselves apart.You know, we have to stop this because, you know, if we manage to damage ourselves, and we lose the next election, and a progressive gets in there and they get two or three Supreme Court picks, this nation is over as we know it. And we got to look at the big picture here.BARTIROMO: Governor Kasich...(APPLAUSE)... Governor Kasich, Hillary Clinton is getting some serious competition from Senator Bernie Sanders. Hes now at 41 percent in the latest CBS/New York Times poll. Vice President Biden sang his praises, saying Bernie is speaking to a yearning that is deep and real, and he has credibility on it.So what does it say about our country that a candidate who is a self-avowed socialist and who doesnt think a 90 percent tax rate is too high could be the Democratic nominee?KASICH: Well, if thats the case, were going to win every state, if Bernie Sanders is the nominee. Thats not even an issue. But look...(APPLAUSE)... and I know Bernie, and I can promise you hes not going to be president of the United States. So heres this  the situation, I think, Maria.And this is what we have to  I  Ive got to tell you, when wages dont rise  and they havent for a lot of families for a number of years  its very, very difficult for them.Part of the reason why it hasnt risen because sometimes were not giving people the skills they need. Sometimes its because the Federal Reserve kept interest rates so low that the wealthy were able to invest in  in strong assets like the stock market when everybody else was left behind.People are upset about it. Ill tell you what else theyre upset about: youre 50 or 51 years old, and some kid walks in and tells you youre out of work, and you dont know where to go and where to turn. Do we have answer for that? We do. There are ways to retrain the 50 and 51-year-olds, because theyve got great value.Ill tell you what else people are concerned about. Their kids come out of college, they have high debt and they cant get a good job. We got to do a lot about the high cost of high  higher education, but weve got to make sure were training people for jobs that exist, that are good jobs that can pay.(APPLAUSE)Let me tell you that, in this country  in this country, people are concerned about their economic future. Theyre very concerned about it. And they wonder whether somebody is getting something to  keeping them from getting it.Thats not the America that Ive ever known. My father used to say, Johnny, we never  we dont hate the rich. We just want to be the rich. And we just got to make sure that every American has the tools, in K-through-12 and in vocational education, in higher education.And we got to fight like crazy so people can think the American dream still exists, because it does, with rising wages, with full employment and with everybody in America  and I mean everybody in America  having an opportunity to realize the American dream of having a better life than their mother and their father.Im president  look, Ive done it once. Ive done it once in Washington, with great jobs and lower taxes. The economy was really booming.And now in Ohio, with the same formula, wages higher than the  than the national average. A growth of 385,000 jobs.(BELL RINGS)Its not that hard. Just know where you want to go, stick to your guts. Get it done, because our  our children and grandchildren are counting on us to get it done. And, folks, we will. You count on it.BARTIROMO: Dr. Carson, one of the other candidates on this stage has brought Bill Clintons past indiscretions. Is that a legitimate topic in this election? And what do you think of the notion that Hillary Clinton is an enabler of sexual misconduct?CARSON: Well, theres not question that we should be able to look at past president whether theyre married to somebody whos running for president or not in terms of their past behavior and what it means. But you know, heres the real issue, is this America anymore? Do we still have standards? Do we still have values and principles?You know, you look at whats going on, you see all the divisiveness and the hatred that goes on in our society. You know, we have a war on virtual everything  race wars, gender wars, income wars, religious wars, age wars. Every war you can imaging, we have people at each others throat and our strength is actually in our unity.You know, you go to the internet, you start reading an article and you go to the comments section  you cannot go five comments down before people are calling each all manner of names. Where did that spirit come from in America? It did not come from our Judeo-Christian roots, I can tell you that. And wherever it came from we need to start once again recognizing that there is such a thing as right and wrong. And lets not let the secular progressives drive that out of us.The majority of people in American actually have values and principles and they believe in the very things that made America great. Theyve been beaten into submission. Its time for us to stand up for what we believe in.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Well, we are not done. Coming up, one of the top things people are talking about on Facebook, guns. And you can join us live us on this stage in the conversation during this commercial break right from home. You can go to Facebook.com/(inaudible). We will be streaming live and talking about how we think the debate is going so far.Were back in a moment in Charleston, South Carolina.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Welcome back to the Republican presidential debates, right here in North Charleston. Lets get right back to the questions.Governor Bush, gun rights, one of the top issues seen on Facebook with close to 3 million people talking about it in the past month. Right here in Charleston, Dylann Roof, who has been accused of killing nine people in a nearby church, reportedly had not passed his background check when he got his gun. What is the harm in tightening standards for not only who buys guns, but those who sell them?BUSH: First of all, Id like to recognize Governor Haley for her incredible leadership in the aftermath of the (APPLAUSE)BUSH: The Emanuel AME church killings. And I also want to recognize the people in that church that showed the grace of God and the grace of forgiveness and the mercy that they showed.(APPLAUSE)BUSH: I dont know if any of us could have done what they did, one after another, within 48 hours of that tragedy taking place. Look, heres the deal, in this particular case, the FBI made a mistake. The law itself requires a background check, but that didnt fulfill their part of the bargain within the time that they were supposed to do.We dont need to add new rules, we need to make sure the FBI does its job. Because that person should not have gotten a gun, should not  would not have passed a background check. The first impulse of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton is to take rights away from law- abiding citizens.Thats what they do, whether its the San Bernardino attack or if its these tragedies that take place, I think we need to focus on what the bigger issue is. It isnt law-abiding gun owners.Look, I have an A plus rating in the NRA and we also have a reduction in gun violence because in Florida, if you commit a crime with a gun, youre going away. Youre going away for a long, long while.And thats what we should focus on is the violence in our communities. Target the efforts for people that are committing crimes with guns, and if you do that, and get it right, youre going to be much better off than creating a political argument where theres a big divide.The other issue is mental health. Thats a serious issue that we could work on. Republicans and Democrats alike believe this.(APPLAUSE)BUSH: The presidents first impulse is do this by executive order, power he doesnt have. Why not go to Congress and in a bipartisan way, begin to deal with the process of mental health issues so that people that are spiraling out of control because of mental health challenges dont have access to guns.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Thank you, sir.Mr. Trump, are there any circumstances that you think we should be limiting gun sales of any kind in America?TRUMP: No. I am a 2nd amendment person. If we had guns in California on the other side where the bullets went in the different direction, you wouldnt have 14 or 15 people dead right now.If even in Paris, if they had guns on the other side, going in the opposite direction, you wouldnt have 130 people plus dead. So the answer is no and what Jeb said is absolutely correct.We have a huge mental health problem in this country. Were closing hospitals, were closing wards, were closing so many because the states want to save money. We have to get back into looking at whats causing it. The guns dont pull the trigger. Its the people that pull the trigger and we have to find out what is going on.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: We have to protect our 2nd amendment and you cannot do this and certainly what Barack Obama was doing with the executive order. He doesnt want to get people together, the old-fashioned way, where you get Congress. You get the Congress, you get the Senate, you get together, you do legislation. He just writes out an executive order. Not supposed to happen that way.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Thank you sir.XXX where you get Congress.TRUMP: You get the Congress. You get the Senate. You get together. You do legislation. He just writes out an order, executive order. Its not supposed to happen that way.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Thank you, sir.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Senator Rubio, you said that President Obama wants to take peoples guns away. Yet under his presidency, gun sales have more than doubled. That doesnt sound like a White House unfriendly to gun owners.RUBIO: That sounds like people are afraid the presidents going to take their guns away.(APPLAUSE)Look, the Second Amendment is not an option. It is not a suggestion. It is a constitutional right of every American to be able to protect themselves and their families. I am convinced that if this president could confiscate every gun in America, he would. I am convinced that this president, if he could get rid of the Second Amendment, he would. I am convinced because I see how he works with his attorney general, not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.I have seen him appoint people to our courts not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.Heres my second problem. None of these instances that the president points to as the reason why hes doing these things would have been preventive. You know why? Because criminals dont buy their guns from a gun show. They dont buy their guns from a collector. And they dont buy their guns from a gun store. They get  they steal them. They get them on the black market.And let me tell you, ISIS and terrorists do not get their guns from a gun show. These...(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)... his answer  you name it. If theres an act of violence in America, his immediate answer before he even knows the facts is gun control. Heres a fact. We are in a war against ISIS. They are trying to attack us here in America. They attacked us in Philadelphia last week. They attacked us in San Bernardino two weeks ago. And the last line standing between them and our families might be us and a gun.When Im president of the United States, we are defending the Second Amendment, not undermining it the way Barack Obama does.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: But what fact can you point to, Senator  what fact can you point to that the president would take away everyones gun? You dont think thats (inaudible)?RUBIO: About every two weeks, he holds a press conference talking about how he cant wait to restrict peoples access to guns. He has never defended...(CROSSTALK)RUBIO: Ill give you a fact. Well, let me tell you this. Do you remember when he ran for president of the United States, and he was a candidate, and he went and said, These Americans with traditional values, they are bitter people, and they cling to their guns and to their religion. That tells you right away where he was headed on all of this.This president every chance he has ever gotten has tried to undermine the Second Amendment.(APPLAUSE)He doesnt meet  heres the difference. When he meets with the attorney general in the White House, its not how can we protect the Second Amendment rights of Americans. Its give me options on how I can make it harder for law-abiding people to buy guns. That will never happen when I am president of the United States.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Governor Christie, you, too, have criticized the presidents recent executive action on gun control, saying its unconstitutional, another step to bypass Congress. But hasnt your own position on guns evolved, sir? The New Jersey Star-Ledger reports that you signed several laws to regulate the possession of firearms, and that you argued back in August 2013, and I quote, These common sense measures will strengthen New Jerseys already tough gun laws.So isnt that kind of what the president wants to do now?CHRISTIE: No, absolutely not. The president wants to do things without working with his Congress, without working with the legislature, and without getting the consent of the American people. And the fact is that thats not a democracy. Thats a dictatorship. And we need to very, very concerned about that.See, heres the thing. I dont think the founders put the Second Amendment as number two by accident. I dont think they dropped all the amendments into a hat and picked them out of a hat. I think they made the Second Amendment the second amendment because they thought it was just that important.The fact is in New Jersey, what we have done is to make it easier now to get a conceal and carry permit. We have made it easier to do that, not harder. And the way weve done it properly through regulatory action, not buy signing unconstitutional executive orders. This guy is a petulant child. Thats what he is. I mean, you know...(APPLAUSE)... the fact is, Neil, lets think about  lets think about  and I want to maybe  I hope the president is watching tonight, because heres what Id like to tell him.Mr. President, were not against you. Were against your policies. When you became president, you had a Democratic Congress and a filibuster-proof Democratic Senate. You had only 21 Republican governors in this country. And now after seven years of your policies, we have the biggest majority weve had since the 1920s in the House; a Republican majority in the Senate; and 31 out of 50 Republican governors.The American people have rejected your agenda and now youre trying to go around it. Thats not right. Its not constitutional. And we are going to kick your rear end out of the White House come this fall.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: So what is the answer, Senator Cruz, to stop mass shootings and violent crime, up in 30 cities across the country?CRUZ: The answer is simple. Your prosecute criminals. You target the bad guys. You know, a minute ago, Neil asked: What has President Obama do  done to illustrate that he wants to go after guns?Well, he appointed Eric Holder as attorney general. Eric Holder said he viewed his mission as brainwashing the American people against guns. He appointed Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court, someone who has been a radical against the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.He launched Fast and Furious, illegally selling guns to Mexican drug lords that were then used to shoot law enforcement officials. And Ill tell you what Hillary Clinton has said: Hillary Clinton says she agrees with the dissenters  the Supreme Court dissenters in the Heller case.There were four dissenters, and they said that they believe the Second Amendment protects no individual right to keep and bear arms whatsoever, which means, if their view prevailed and the next presidents going to get one, two, three, maybe four Supreme Court justices, the court will rule that not a single person in this room has any right under the Second Amendment and the government could confiscate your guns.And Ill note that California senator  Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said, if she could say to Mr. America and Mrs. America, give me your guns, Im rounding them up, she would.And let me make a final point on this. Listen, in any Republican primary, everyone is going to say they support the Second Amendment. Unless you are clinically insane...(LAUGHTER)... thats what you say in a primary. But the voters are savvier than that. They recognize that peoples actions dont always match their words. Ive got a proven record fighting to defend the Second Amendment.Theres a reason Gun Owners of America has endorsed me in this race. Theres a reason the NRA gave me their Carter Knight Freedom Fund award...(BELL RINGS) ... and theres a reason, when Barack Obama and Chuck Schumer came after our right to keep and bear arms, that I led the opposition, along with millions of Americans  we defeated that gun control legislation.And I would note the other individuals on this stage were nowhere to be found in that fight.BARTIROMO: Senator...(APPLAUSE)... let me follow up and switch gears.Senator Cruz, you suggested Mr. Trump, quote, embodies New York values. Could you explain what you mean by that?CRUZ: You know, I think most people know exactly what New York values are.(LAUGHTER)BARTIROMO: I am from New York. I dont.CRUZ: What  what  youre from New York? So you might not.(LAUGHTER)But I promise you, in the state of South Carolina, they do.(APPLAUSE)And listen, there are many, many wonderful, wonderful working men and women in the state of New York. But everyone understands that the values in New York City are socially liberal or pro-abortion or pro- gay-marriage, focus around money and the media.And  and I would note indeed, the reason I said that is I was asked  my friend Donald has taken to it as (ph) advance playing Bruce Springsteens Born in the USA, and I was asked what I thought of that.And I said, well, if he wanted to play a song, maybe he could play, New York, New York? And  and  you know, the concept of New York values is not that complicated to figure out.Not too many years ago, Donald did a long interview with Tim Russert. And in that interview, he explained his views on a whole host of issues that were very, very different from the views hes describing now.And his explanation  he said, look, Im from New York, thats what we believe in New York. Those arent Iowa values, but this is what we believe in New York. And so that was his explanation.And  and I guess I can  can frame it another way. Not a lot of conservatives come out of Manhattan. Im just saying.(LAUGHTER)BARTIROMO: Are you sure about that?CAVUTO: Maria...TRUMP: So conservatives actually do come out of Manhattan, including William F. Buckley and others, just so you understand.(APPLAUSE)And just so  if I could, because he insulted a lot of people. Ive had more calls on that statement that Ted made  New York is a great place. Its got great people, its got loving people, wonderful people.When the World Trade Center came down, I saw something that no place on Earth could have handled more beautifully, more humanely than New York. You had two one hundred...(APPLAUSE)... you had two 110-story buildings come crashing down. I saw them come down. Thousands of people killed, and the cleanup started the next day, and it was the most horrific cleanup, probably in the history of doing this, and in construction. I was down there, and Ive never seen anything like it.And the people in New York fought and fought and fought, and we saw more death, and even the smell of death  nobody understood it. And it was with us for months, the smell, the air. And we rebuilt downtown Manhattan, and everybody in the world watched and everybody in the world loved New York and loved New Yorkers. And I have to tell you, that was a very insulting statement that Ted made.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Governor bush, for the third time in as many months, the Iranians have provoked us, detaining us, as weve been discussing, with these 10 Navy sailors Tehran had said strayed into their waters. The sailors were released, but only after shown on video apologizing for the incident. This occurring only weeks after Iran fired multiple rockets within 1,500 yards of a U.S. aircraft carrier and then continued to test medium range missiles.Now youve claimed that such actions indicate Tehran has little to fear from a President Obama. I wonder, sir, what would change if they continued doing this sort of thing under a President Jeb Bush?BUSH: Well, first of all, under President Jeb Bush, we would restore the strength of the military. Last week, Secretary Carter announced that the Navys going to be cut again. Its now half the size of what it was prior to Operation Desert Storm.The deployments are too high for the military personnel. We dont have procurement being done for refreshing the equipment. The B-52 is still operational as the long range bomber; it was inaugurated in the age of Harry Truman. The planes are older than the pilots. Were gutting our military, and so the Iranians and the Chinese and the Russians and many other countries look at the United States not as serious as we once were.We have to eliminate the sequester, rebuild our military in a way that makes it clear that were back in the game.Secondly, as it relates to Iran, we need to confront their ambitions across the board. We should reimpose sanctions, theyve already violated sanctions after this agreement was signed by testing medium-range missiles.Thirdly, we need to move our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem to send a serious signal that were back in the game with Israel (APPLAUSE)... and sign an agreement that makes sure that the world knows that they will have technological superiority.We need to get back in the game as it relates to our Arab nations. The rest of the world is moving away from us towards other alliances because we are weak. This president and John Kerry and Hillary Clinton all have made it harder for the next president to act, but he must act to confront the ambitions of Iran. We can get back in the game to restore order and security for our own country.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Thank you, Governor. Governor Kasich, while everyone has been focusing on Irans provocations, Im wondering what you make of what Saudi Arabia has been doing and its recent moves in the region, including its execution of a well-known Shiite cleric and its move to dramatically increase oil production, some say in an effort to drive down oil prices and force a lot of U.S. oil producers out of business.Sure enough, oil prices have tumbled. One brokerage house is predicting a third or more of American oil producers and those heavily invested in fracking will go bankrupt, and soon Saudi Arabia and OPEC will be back in the drivers seat.U.S. energy player Harold Hamrie similarly told me with friends like these, who needs enemies? Do you agree?KASICH: Well, let me  let me first of all talk a little bit about my experience. I served on the Defense Committee for 18 years, and by the way, one of the members of that committee was Senator Strom Thurmond from South Carolina. Let em also tell you...(APPLAUSE)... that after the 9/11 attacks, Secretary Rumsfeld invited me to the Pentagon with a meeting of the former secretaries of Defense. And in that meeting, I suggested we had a problem with technology, and that I wanted to take people from Silicon Valley into the Pentagon to solve our most significant problems. So I not only had the opportunity to go through the Cold War struggles in Central America, and even after 9/11 to be involved.With Saudi Arabia and oil production, first of all, its so critical for us to be energy independent, and were getting there because of fracking and we ought to explore because, see, energy independence gives us leverage and flexibility, and secondly, if you want to bring jobs back to the United States of America in industry, low prices make the difference.Were seeing it in my state and well see it in this country. And thats why we must make sure we continue to frack.In terms of Saudi Arabia, look, my biggest problem with them is theyre funding radical clerics through their madrasses. That is a bad deal and an evil situation, and presidents have looked the other way. And I was going to tell you, whether Im president or not, we better make it clear to the Saudis that were going to support you, were in relation with you just like we were in the first Gulf War, but youve got to knock off the funding and teaching of radical clerics who are the very people who try to destroy us and will turn around and destroy them.(APPLAUSE)So look, in foreign policy  in foreign policy, its strength, but youve got to be cool. Youve got to have a clear vision of where you want to go. And Im going to tell you, that it  Im going to suggest to you here tonight, that you cant do on the job training.Ive seen so much of it - a Soviet Union, the coming down of a wall, the issues that we saw around the world in Central America, the potential spread of communism, and 9/11 and Gulf War. You see what the Saudis  deliver them a strong message but at the end of the day we have to keep our cool because most of the time theyre going right with us. And they must be part of our coalition to destroy ISIS and I believe we can get that done.Thank you.CAVUTO: Thank you John.BARTIROMO: Theres much more ahead including the fight against ISIS. More from Charleston, South Carolina when we come right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO: We welcome back to the Republican Presidential Debate, right back to the questions.Candidates, the man who made fighting ISIS the cornerstone of his campaign, South Carolina Senator, Lindsey Graham is out the race but he joins us tonight in the audience.(APPLAUSE)He says, the air-strike now in their 16th month have been ineffective. Dr. Carson ...CARSON: Wait a minute, who in their 16th month?BARTIROMO: The air-strikes.CARSON: OK.BARTIROMO: Now in their 16th month are ineffective. Dr. Carson, do you think Senator Graham is right in wanting to send 20,000 troops  ground troops to Iraq and Syria to take out ISIS?CARSON: Well, theres no question that ISIS is a very serious problem, and I dont believe that this administration recognizes how serious it is.I think we need to do a lot more than were doing. Recognize that the caliphate is what gives them the legitimacy to go out on a jihadist mission, so we need to take that away from them.The way to take that away from them is to talk to our military officials and ask them, what do you need in order to accomplish this goal?Our decision is, then, do we give them what we need. I say, yes, not only do we give them what they need, but we dont tie their hands behind their backs so that they can go ahead and get the job done.In addition to that...(APPLAUSE)... in addition to that, we go ahead and we take the oil from them, their source of revenue. You know, some of these  these engagement rules that the administration has  were not going to bomb a tanker thats coming out of there because there might be a person in it  give me a break.Just tell them that, you put people in there, were going to bomb them. So dont put people in there if you dont want them bombed. You know, thats so simple.(APPLAUSE)And then we need to shut down  we need to shut down their mechanisms of funding and attack their command-and-control centers. Why should we let their people be sitting there smoking their cigars, sitting in their comfortable chairs in Raqqa?We know (ph) to go ahead and shut off the supply routes, and send in our special ops at 2:00 a.m. and attack them everywhere they go. They should be running all the time, then they wont have time to plan attacks against us.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Thank you, sir. Senator Graham has also said that the U.S. will find Arab support for its coalition if it removes Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. And I quote, The now king of Saudi Arabia told us, you can have our army, you just got to deal with Assad.The emir of Qatar said, Ill pay for the operation, but they are not going to fight ISIS and let Damascus fall into the hands of the Iranians. Assad has to go.Governor Christie, how important is it to remove Assad from power and how would you do it?CHRISTIE: Maria, you look at what this president and his secretary of state, Secretary of State Clinton, has done to get us in this spot. You think about it  this is the president who said, along with his secretary of state  drew a red line in Syria, said, if Assad uses chemical weapons against his people, that were going to attack.He used chemical weapons, hes killed, now, over a quarter of a million of his own people, and this president has done nothing. In fact, hes done worse than nothing.This president  and, by the way, Secretary Clinton, who called Assad a reformer  she called Assad a reformer. Now, the fact is, what this president has done is invited Russia to play an even bigger role, bring in Vladimir Putin to negotiate getting those chemical weapons back from Assad, yet what do we have today?We have the Russians and the Iranians working together, not to fight ISIS, but to prop up Assad. The fact of the matter is were not going to have peace  we are not going to have peace in Syria. Were not going to be able to rebuild it unless we put a no-fly zone there, make it safe for those folks so we dont have to be talking about Syrian refugees anymore.The Syrians should stay in Syria. They shouldnt be going to Europe. And heres the last piece...(APPLAUSE)... youre not going to have peace in Syria with Assad in charge. Youre simply not. And so Senator Graham is right about this.And if we want to try to rebuild the coalition, as Governor Kasich was saying before, then what we better do is to get to the Arab countries that believe that ISIS is a threat, not only to them, but to us and to world peace, and bring them together.And believe me, Assad is not worth it. And if youre going to leave this to Hillary Clinton, the person who gave us this foreign policy, the architect of it, and youre going to give her another four years, thats why Im speaking out as strongly as I am about that.Hillary Clinton cannot be president. It will lead to even greater war in this world. And remember this, after Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have had nearly 8 years, we have fewer democracies in the world than we had when they started.That makes the world less peaceful, less safe. In my administration, we will help to make sure we bring people together in the Middle East, and we will fight ISIS and defeat them.BARTIROMO: Thank you, sir.(APPLAUSE)Mr. Trump  Mr. Trump, your comments about banning Muslims from entering the country created a firestorm. According to Facebook, it was the most-talked-about moment online of your entire campaign, with more than 10 million people talking about the issue.Is there anything youve heard that makes you want to rethink this position?TRUMP: No.(LAUGHTER)No.(APPLAUSE)Look, we have to stop with political correctness. We have to get down to creating a country thats not going to have the kind of problems that weve had with people flying planes into the World Trade Centers, with the  with the shootings in California, with all the problems all over the world. I just left Indonesia  bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb.We have to find out whats going on. I said temporarily. I didnt say permanently. I said temporarily. And I have many great Muslim friends. And some of them, I will say, not all, have called me and said, Donald, thank you very much; youre exposing an unbelievable problem and we have to get to the bottom of it.And unlike President Obama, where he refuses even to use the term of whats going on, he cant use the term for whatever reason. And if you cant use the term, youre never going to solve the problem. My Muslim friends, some, said, thank you very much; well get to the bottom of it.But we have a serious problem. And we cant be the stupid country any more. Were laughed at all over the world.(APPLAUSE)BUSH: Donald, Donald  can I  I hope you reconsider this, because this policy is a policy that makes it impossible to build the coalition necessary to take out ISIS. The Kurds are our strongest allies. Theyre Muslim. Youre not going to even allow them to come to our country?The other Arab countries have a role to play in this. We cannot be the worlds policeman. We cant do this unilaterally. We have to do this in unison with the Arab world. And sending that signal makes it impossible for us to be serious about taking out ISIS and restoring democracy in Syria.(APPLAUSE)So I hope youll reconsider. I hope youll reconsider. The better way of dealing with this  the better way of dealing with this is recognizing that there are people in, you know, the  Islamic terrorists inside, embedded in refugee populations.What we ought to do is tighten up our efforts to deal with the entry visa program so that a citizen from Europe, its harder if theyve been traveling to Syria or traveling to these other places where there is Islamic terrorism, make it harder  make the screening take place.We dont have to have refugees come to our country, but all Muslims, seriously? What kind of signal does that send to the rest of the world that the United States is a serious player in creating peace and security?CAVUTO: But you said  you said that he made those comments and they represented him being unhinged after he made them.BUSH: Yeah, they are unhinged.CAVUTO: Well  well, after he made them...(APPLAUSE)... his poll numbers went up eight points in South Carolina. Now  now, wait...TRUMP: Eleven points, to be exact.CAVUTO: Are you  are you saying  are you saying that all those people who agree with Mr. Trump are unhinged?BUSH: No, not at all, absolutely not. I can see why people are angry and scared, because this president has created a condition where our national security has weakened dramatically. I totally get that. But were running for the presidency of the United States here. This isnt  this isnt, you know, a different kind of job. You have to lead. You cannot make rash statements and expect the rest of the world to respond as though, well, its just politics.Every time we send signals like this, we send a signal of weakness, not strength. And so it was (inaudible) his statement, which is why Im asking him to consider changing his views.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: I want security for this country. OK?(APPLAUSE)I want security. Im tired of seeing whats going on, between the border where the people flow over; people come in; they live; they shoot. I want security for this country. We have a serious problem with, as you know, with radical Islam. We have a tremendous problem. Its not only a problem here. Its a problem all over the world.I want to find out why those two young people  those two horrible young people in California when they shot the 14 people, killed them  people they knew, people that held the wedding reception for them. I want to find out  many people saw pipe bombs and all sorts of things all over their apartment. Why werent they vigilant? Why didnt they call? Why didnt they call the police?And by the way, the police are the most mistreated people in this country. I will tell you that.(APPLAUSE)The most mistreated people. In fact, we need to  wait a minute  we need vigilance. We have to find out  many people knew about what was going on. Why didnt they turn those two people in so that you wouldnt have had all the death?Theres something going on and its bad. And Im saying we have to get to the bottom of it. Thats all Im saying. We need security.BARTIROMO: We  we want to hear from all of you on this. According to Pew Research, the U.S. admits more than 100,000 Muslim immigrants every single year on a permanent lifetime basis. I want to ask the rest of you to comment on this. Do you agree that we should pause Muslim immigration until we get a better handle on our homeland security situation, as Mr. Trump has said?Beginning with you, Governor Kasich.KASICH: I  Ive been for pausing on admitting the Syrian refugees. And the reasons why Ive done is I dont believe we have a good process of being able to vet them. But you know, we dont want to put everybody in the same category. And Ill go back to something that had been mentioned just a few minutes ago. If were going to have a coalition, were going to have to have a coalition not just of people in the western part of the world, our European allies, but we need the Saudis, we need the Egyptians, we need the Jordanians, we need the Gulf states. We need Jordan.We need all of them to be part of exactly what the first George Bush put together in the first Gulf War.(BELL RINGS)It was a coalition made up of Arabs and Americans and westerners and were going to need it again. And if we try to put everybody in the same  call everybody the same thing, we cant do it. And thats just not acceptable.But I think a pause on Syrian refugees has been exactly right for all the governors that have called for it, and also, of course, for me as the governor of Ohio.BARTIROMO: Thank you, sir, we want to hear from the rest of you,Governor Christie, your take.CHRISTIE: Now Maria, listen. I said right from the beginning that we should take no Syrian refugees of any kind. And the reason I said that is because the FBI director told the American people, told Congress, that he could not guarantee he could vet them and it would be safe. Thats the end of the conversation.I can tell you, after spending seven years as a former federal prosecutor, right after 9/11, dealing with this issue. Heres the way you need to deal with it. You cant just ban all Muslims. You have to ban radical Islamic jihadists. You have to ban the people who are trying to hurt us.The only way to figure that out is to go back to getting the intelligence community the funding and the tools that it needs to be able to keep America safe.(BELL RINGS)And this summer, we didnt do that. We took it away from the NSA, it was a bad decision by the president. Bad by those in the Senate who voted for it and if Im president, well make our intelligence community strong, and wont have to keep everybody out, were just going to keep the bad folk out and make sure they dont harm us.BARTIROMO: Senator Rubio, where do you stand?RUBIO: Well, first of all, lets understand why we are even having this debate and why Donald tapped in to some of that anger thats out there about this whole issue. Because this president has consistently underestimated the threat of ISIS.If you listen to the State of the Union the other night, he described them as a bunch of guys with long beards on the back of a pickup truck. They are much more than that. This is a group of people that enslaves women and sells them, sells them as brides.This is a group of people that burns people in cages, that is conducting genocide against Christians and Yazidis and others in the region. This is not some small scale group.They are radicalizing people in the United States, they are conducting attacks around the world. So you know what needs to happen, its a very simple equation, and its going to happen when Im president. If we do not know who you are, and we do not know why you are coming when I am president, you are not getting into the United States of America.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Senator Cruz, where do you stand? Senator Cruz?CRUZ: You know I understand why Donald made the comments he did and I understand why Americans are feeling frustrated and scared and angry when we have a president who refuses to acknowledge the threat we face and even worse, who acts as an apologist for radical Islamic terrorism.I think what we need is a commander in chief who is focused like a laser on keeping this country safe and on defeating radical Islamic terrorism. What should we do? First, we should pass the Expatriate Terrorist Act, legislation Ive introduced that says if an American goes and joins ISIS and wages jihad against America, that you forfeit your citizenship and you can not come in on a passport.(APPLAUSE)CRUZ: And secondly, we should pass the legislation that Ive introduced...(BELL RINGS)... that suspends all refugees from nations that ISIS or Al Qaida controls significant territory. Just last week, we see saw two Iraqi refugees vetted using the same process the president says will work, that were arrested for being alleged ISIS terrorists.If Im elected president, we will not let in refugees from countries controlled by ISIS or Al Qaida. When it comes to ISIS, we will not weaken them, we will not degrade them, we will utterly and completely destroy ISIS(APPLAUSE).BARTIROMO: Dr. Carson, where do you stand? Do you agree with Mr. Trump?CARSON: Well, first of all, recognize it is a substantial problem. But like all of our problems, there isnt a single one that cant be solved with common sense if you remove the ego and the politics. And clearly, what we need to do is get a group of experts together, including people from other countries, some of our friends from Israel, who have had experience screening these people and come up with new guidelines for immigration, and for visas, for people who are coming into this country.That is the thing that obviously makes sense, we can do that. And as far as the Syrians are concerned, Al-Hasakah province, perfect place. They have infrastructure. All we need to do is protect them, they will be in their own country.And that is what they told me when I was in Jordan in November. Lets listen to them and lets not listen to our politicians.BARTIROMO: So, to be clear, the both of you do not agree with Mr. Trump?BUSH: So, are we going to ban Muslims from India, from Indonesia, from countries that are strong allies  that we need to build better relationships with? Of course not. What we need to do is destroy ISIS.I laid out a plan at the Citadel to do just that and it starts with creating a No Fly Zone and Safe Zones to make sure refugees are there. We need to lead a force, a Sunni led force inside of Syria. We need to embed with  with the Iraqi military. We need to arm the Kurds the directly. We need to re-establish the relationships with the Sunnis.We need the lawyers(ph) off the back of the war fighters. Thats how you solve the problem. You dont solve it by big talk where youre banning all Muslims and making it harder for us to build the kind of coalition for us to be successful.BARTIROMO: Thank you governor.CAVUTO: Mr. Trump, sometimes maybe in the heat of the campaign, you say things and you have to dial them back. Last week, the New York Times editorial board quoted as saying that you would oppose, up to 45 percent tariff on Chinese goods.TRUMP: Thats wrong. They were wrong. Its the New York Times, they are always wrong.CAVUTO: Well...TRUMP: They were wrong.CAVUTO: You never said because they provided that...TRUMP: No, I said,  I would use   they were asking me what to do about North Korea. China, they dont like to tell us but they have total control  just about, of North Korea. They can solve the problem of North Korea if they wanted to but they taunt us.They say,  well, we dont really have control. Without China, North Korea doesnt even eat. China is ripping us on trade. Theyre devaluing their currency and theyre killing our companies. Thousands of thousands  you look at the number of companies and the number in terms of manufacturing of plans that weve lost  50,000 because of China.(CROSSTALK) CAVUTO: So theyve never said to put a tariff on their...TRUMP: Weve lost anywhere between four and seven million jobs because of China. What I said then was, we have very unfair trade with China. Were going to have a trade deficit of 505 billion dollars this year with China. A lot of that is because they devalue their currency.What I said to the New York Times, is that, we have great power, economic power over China and if we wanted to use that and the amount  where the 45 percent comes in, that would be the amount they saw their devaluations that we should get. That we should get.What Im saying is this, Im saying that we do it but if they dont start treating us fairly and stop devaluing and let their currency rise so that our companies can compete and we dont lose all of these millions of jobs that were losing, I would certainly start taxing goods that come in from China. Who the hell has to lose 505 billion dollars a year?CAVUTO: Im sorry, you lost me.TRUMP: Its not that complicated actually.CAVUTO: Then I apologize. Then I want to understand, if you dont want a 45 percent tariff, say that wasnt the figure, would you be open  are you open to slapping a higher tariff on Chinese goods of any sort to go back at them?TRUMP: OK, just so you understand  I know so much about trading about with China. Carl Icahn today as you know endorsed. Many businessmen want to endorse me.CAVUTO: I know...TRUMP: Carl said, no, no   but hes somebody  these are the kind of people that we should use to negotiate and not the China people that we have who are political hacks who dont know what theyre doing and we have problems like this. If these are the kinds of people  we should use our best and our finest.Now, on that tariff  heres what Im saying, China  they send their goods and we dont tax it  they do whatever they want to do. They do whatever what they do, OK. When we do business with China, they tax us. You dont know it, they tax us.I have many friends that deal with China. They cant  when they order the product and when they finally get the product it is taxed. If you looking at what happened with Boeing and if you look at what happened with so many companies that deal  so we dont have an equal playing field. Im saying, absolutely, we dont have to continue to lose 505 billion dollars as a trade deficit for the privilege of dealing with China.Im a free trader. I believe in it but we have to be smart and we have to use smart people to negotiate. I have the largest bank in the world as a tenant of mine. I sell tens of millions of (inaudible).I love China. I love the Chinese people but they laugh themselves, they cant believe how stupid the American leadership is.CAVUTO: So youre open to a tariff?TRUMP: Im totally open to a tariff. If they dont treat us fairly, hey, their whole trade is tariffed. You cant deal in China without tariffs. They do it to us, we dont it. Its not fair trade.KASICH: Neil, Neil  can I say one thing about this. Im a free trader. I support NAFTA. I believe in the PTT because its important those countries in Asia are interfacing against China. And we do need China  Donalds right about North Korea.I mean the fact is, is that they need to put the pressure on and frankly we need to intercepts ships coming out of North Korea so they dont proliferate all these dangerous materials. But what hes touching  talking about, I think has got merit. And Ill allow putting that tariff or whatever hes saying here...TRUMP: Im happy to have him tonight...(LAUGHTER)KASICH: For too long  no, for too long, what happens is somebody dumps their product in our country and take our peoples jobs, and then we go to an international court and it takes them like a year or two to figure out whether they were cheating us. And guess what? The workers out of a job.So when they  be found against that country thats selling products in here lower than the cost of what it takes to produce them, then what do we tell the worker? Oh, well, you know, it just didnt work out for you.I think we should be for free trade but I think fair trade. And when countries violate trade agreements or dump product in this country, we need  we need to stand up against those countries that do that without making them into an enemy.And I want to just suggest to you. How do I know this? Because so many people in my family worked in steel mills, and they didnt work with a white collar, they worked in a blue collar. And the fact is those jobs are critical, theyre hard working members of the middle class and they need to be paid attention to because theyre Americans and they carry the load. So lets demand open trade but fair trade in this country. Thats what I think we need to do.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: All right.RUBIO: But on this point, if I may add something on this point. We are all frustrated with what China is doing. I think we need to be very careful with tariffs, and heres why.China doesnt pay the tariff, the buyer pays the tariff. If you send a tie or a shirt made in China into the United States and an American goes to buy it at the store and theres a tariff on it, it gets passed on in the price to price to the consumer.So I think the better approach, the best thing we can do to protect ourselves against China economically is to make our economy stronger, which means reversing course from all the damage Barack Obama is doing to this economy.It begins with tax reform. Lets not have the most expensive business tax rate in the world. Lets allow companies to immediately expense.(APPLAUSE)It continues with regulatory reform. Regulations in this country are out of control, especially the Employment Prevention Agency, the EPA, and all of the rules they continue to impose on our economy and hurting us.How about Obamacare, a certified job killer? It needs to be repealed and replaced. And we need to bring our debt under control, make our economy stronger. That is the way to deal with China at the end of the day.TRUMP: Neil, the problem BARTIROMO: Were getting TRUMP:  with what Marco is saying is that it takes too long, theyre sucking us dry and it takes too long. It would just  you absolutely have to get involved with China, they are taking so much of what we have in terms of jobs in terms of money. We just cant do it any longer.CAVUTO: He is right. If you put a tariff on a good, its Americans who pay.BUSH: Absolutely.TRUMP: You looking at me?BUSH: Yeah.BARTIROMO: Prices go higher for TRUMP: Can I tell you what? It will never happen because theyll let their currency go up. Theyre never going to let it happen.Japan, the same thing. They are devaluing  its so impossible for  you look at Caterpillar Tractor and whats happening with Caterpillar and Kamatsu (ph). Kamatsu (ph) is a tractor company in Japan. Friends of mine are ordering Kamatsu (ph) tractors now because theyve de-valued the yen to such an extent that you cant buy a Caterpillar tractor. And were letting them get away with it and we cant let them get away with it.And thats why we have to use Carl (ph) and we have to use our great businesspeople and not political hacks to negotiate with these guys.(APPLAUSE)BUSH: Heres  apart from the  apart from the higher prices on consumers and people are living paycheck to paycheck, apart from that, there will be retaliation.BARTIROMO: Yeah.BUSH: So they soybean sales from Iowa, entire soybean production goes  the equivalent of it goes to China. Or how about Boeing right here within a mile? Do you think that the Chinese, if they had a 45 percent tariff imposed on all their imports wouldnt retaliate and start buying Airbus? Of course, they would. This would be devastating for the economy. We need someone with a steady hand being president of the United States.BARTIROMO: Real quick, Senator  go ahead, Senator Cruz.(APPLAUSE)And then we have to get to tax reform.TRUMP: And we dont need a weak person being president of the United State, OK? Because thats what wed get if it were Jeb  I tell you what, we dont need that.AUDIENCE: Boo.TRUMP: We dont need that. Thats essentially what we have now, and we dont need that. And thats why were in the trouble that were in now. And by the way, Jeb you mentioned Boeing, take a look. They order planes, they make Boeing build their plant in China. They dont want them made here. They want those planes made in China.BUSH: Theyre a mile away from here.TRUMP: Thats not the way the game is supposed to be played.BARTIROMO: Thank you, Governor Bush. Thank you, Mr. Trump. Very briefly.BUSH: My name was mentioned. My name was mentioned here. The simple fact is that the plane thats being build here is being sold to China. You can  if you  you flew in with your 767, didnt you? Right there, right next to the plant.TRUMP: No, the new planes. Im not talking about now, Im talking about in the future theyre building massive plants in China because China does not want Boeing building their planes here, they want them built in China, because China happens to be smart the way they do it, not the way we do it.BARTIROMO: Thank you, Mr. Trump.BUSH: When you head back to airport tonight, go check and see what the BARTIROMO: Thank you, Mr. Trmup. Thank you, Governor.TRUMP: Ill check for you.BUSH: Check it out.(LAUGHTER)BARTIROMO: Senator briefly.CRUZ: Thanks for coming back to me, Maria. Both Donald and Jeb have good points, and there is a middle ground. Donald is right that China is running over President Obama like he is a child, President Obama is not protecting American workers and we are getting hammered.You know, I sat down with the senior leadership of John Deere. They discussed how  how hard it is to sell tractors in China, because all the regulatory barriers. Theyre protectionist.But Jeb is also right that, if we just impose a tariff, theyll put reciprocal tariffs, which will hurt Iowa farmers and South Carolina producers and 20 percent of the American jobs that depend on exports.So the way you do it is you pass a tax plan like the tax plan Ive introduced: a simple flat tax, 10 percent for individuals, and a 16 percent business flat tax, you abolish the IRS...(APPLAUSE)... and heres the critical point, Maria  the business flat tax enables us to abolish the corporate income tax, the death tax, the Obamacare taxes, the payroll taxes, and theyre border-adjustable, so every export pays no taxes whatsoever.Its tax-free  a huge advantage for our farmers and ranchers and manufacturers  and every import pays the 16 percent business flat tax. Its like a tariff, but heres the difference: if we impose a tariff, China responds.The business flat tax, they already impose their taxes on us, so theres no reciprocal...(BELL RINGS)... tariffs that come against us. It puts us on a level, even playing field, which brings jobs here at home...(UNKNOWN): Maria...CRUZ: ... and as president, Im going to fight for the working men and women.(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: Weve got to get to tax reform, gentlemen. Weve got to get to tax reform, and weve got to get to the...(UNKNOWN): Yeah, but I want to talk about taxes.BARTIROMO: ... weve got to get to the national debt as well. Coming up next, the growing national debt, the war on crime, tax reform. More from North Charleston, South Carolina, when we come right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO: Welcome back to the Republican presidential debate here in North Charleston. Right back to the questions.(APPLAUSE)Governor Christie, we have spoken much about cutting spending, given the $19 trillion debt. But according to one report, America needs $3.6 trillion in infrastructure spending by 2020.Here in South Carolina, 11 percent of bridges are considered structurally deficient, costing drivers a billion dollars a year in auto repairs. What is your plan to fix the ailing roads and bridges without breaking the bank?CHRISTIE: Well, Im glad you asked that, Maria. Heres  heres our plan. Weve all been talking about tax reforms tonight, and paying for infrastructure is caught right up in tax reform.If you reform the corporate tax system in this country, which, as was mentioned before, is the highest rate in the world  and we double tax, as you know.And what thats led to over $2 trillion of American companies monies that are being kept offshore, because they dont want to pay the second tax. And who can blame them? They pay tax once overseas. They dont want to pay 35 percent tax on the way back.So beside reforming that tax code, bringing it down to 25 percent and eliminating those special-interest loopholes that the lobbyists and the lawyers and the accountants have given  bring that rate down to 25 percent, but also, a one-time repatriation of that money.Bring the money  the $2 trillion  back to the United States. Well tax it, that one time, at 8.75 percent, because 35 percent of zero is zero, but 8.75 percent of $2 trillion is a lot of money. And I would then dedicate that money to rebuilding infrastructure here in this country.It would not necessitate us raising any taxes. It would bring the money back into the United States to help build jobs by American companies and get our economy moving again, and growing as a higher rate, and it would rebuild those roads and bridges and tunnels that you were talking about. And  and  and the last piece of this, Maria, is this. You know, the fact is that this president has penalized corporations in America. Hes penalized  and doesnt understand. In fact, what that hurts is hurt hardworking taxpayers.Youve seen middle-class wages go backwards $3,700 during the Obama administration. Thats wrong for hardworking taxpayers in this country. Wed rebuild infrastructure that would also create jobs in this country, and wed work with the states to do it the right way, to do it more efficiently and more effectively.And remember this  Im credible on this for this reason: Americans for Tax Reform says that Ive vetoed more tax increases than any governor in American history. We dont need to raise taxes to get this done.We need to make the government run smarter and better, and reform this corporate tax system, bring that money back to the United States to build jobs and rebuild our infrastructure, and we need to use it also to protect our grid from terrorists.All of those things are important, and all those things would happen in a Christie administration.BARTIROMO: Thank you, sir. Dr. Carson...(APPLAUSE)... it is true U.S. companies have $2 trillion in cash sitting overseas right now. That could be used for investment and jobs in America.Also, several companies right now are pursuing mergers to move their corporate headquarters abroad, and take advantage of much lower taxes. What will you do to stop the flow of companies building cash away from America, and those leaving America altogether?CARSON: Well, I would suggest a fair tax system, and thats what we have proposed. A flat tax for everybody  no exemptions, no deductions, no shelters, because some people have a better capability of taking advantage of those than others.You know, and then the other thing we have to do is stop spending so much money. You know, I  my  my mother taught me this. You know, she only had a third-grade education, but  you know, she knew how to stretch a dollar.I mean, she would drive a car until it wouldnt make a sound, and then gather up all her coins and buy a new car. In fact, if my mother were secretary of treasury, we would not be in a deficit situation. But...(LAUGHTER)... you know, the  the  the fact of the matter is  you know, if we fix the taxation system, make it absolutely fair, and get rid of the incredible regulations  because every regulation is a tax, its a  on goods and services. And its the most regressive tax there is.You know, when you go into the store and buy a box of laundry detergent, and the price has up  you know, 50 cents because of regulations, a poor person notices that. A rich person does not. Middle class may notice it when they get to the cash register.And everything is costing more money, and we are killing our  our  our people like this. And Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton will say its those evil rich people.Its not the evil rich people. Its the evil government that is  that is putting all these regulations on us so that we cant survive.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Thank you, sir.Senator Rubio...TRUMP: Maria  Maria, what you were talking about just now is called corporate inversion. Its one of the biggest problems our country has. Right now, corporations, by the thousands, are thinking of leaving our country with the jobs  leave them behind. Theyre leaving because of taxes, but they are also leaving because they cant get their money back and everybody agrees, Democrats and Republicans, that is should come back in. But they cant get along. They cant even make a deal.Here is the case, they both agree, they cant make a deal. We have to do something. Corporate inversion is one of the biggest problems we have. So many companies are going to leave our country.BARTIROMO: Which is why we raised it.Senator Rubio?Thank you, Mr. Trump.TRUMP: Thank you.BARTIROMO: One of the biggest fiscal challenges is our entitlement programs, particularly Social Security and Medicare. What policies will you put forward to make sure these programs are more financially secure?RUBIO: Well, first let me address the tax issue because its related to the entitlement issue and I want to thank you for holding a substantive debates where we can have debates about these key issues on taxes.(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: Here is the one thing Im not going to do. Im not going to have something that Ted described in his tax plan. Its called the value added tax. And its a tax you find in many companies in Europe.Where basically, businesses now will have to pay a tax, both on the money they make, but they also have to pay taxes on the money that they pay their employees.And thats why they have it in Europe, because it is a way to blindfolded the people, thats what Ronald Reagan said. Ronald Regan opposed the value tax because he said it was a way to blindfold the people, so the true cost of government was not there there for them.Now, you can support one now thats very low. But what is to prevent a future liberal president or a liberal Congress from coming back and not just raising the income tax, but also raising that VAT tax, and that vat tax is really bad for seniors. Because seniors, if they are retired, are no longer earning an income from a job. And therefore, they dont get the income tax break, but their prices are going to be higher, because the vat tax is embedded in both the prices that business that are charging and in the wages they pay their employees.When I am president of the United States, Im going to side with Ronald Regan on this and not Nancy Pelosi and we are not having a vat tax.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Thank you senator.CRUZ: Maria, I assume that I can respond to that.BARTIROMO: Senator Cruz, yes. You were meant to. Yes, of course.CRUZ: Well, Marco has been floating this attack for a few weeks now, but the problem is, the business flat tax in my proposal is not a vat. A vat is imposed as a sales tax when you buy a good.This is a business flat tax. It is imposed on business and a critical piece that Marco seems to be missing is that this 16 percent business flat tax enables us to eliminate the corporate income tax. It goes away. It enables us to eliminate the death tax.If youre a farmer, if youre a rancher, if you are small business owner, the death tax is gone. We eliminate the payroll tax, we eliminate the Obamacare taxes. And listen, there is a real difference between Marcos tax plan and mine.Mine gives every American a simple, flat tax of 10 percent. Marcos top tax rate is 35 percent. My tax plan enables you to fill out your taxes on a postcard so we can abolish the IRS. Marco leaves the IRS code in with all of the complexity. We need to break the Washington cartel, and the only way to do it is to end all the subsidies and all...(BELL RINGS)... the mandates and have a simple flat tax. The final observation, invoked Ronald Reagan. I would note that Art Laffer, Ronald Reagans chief economic adviser, has written publicly, that my simple flat tax is the best tax plan of any of the individuals on this stage cause it produces economic growth, it raises wages and it helps everyone from the very poorest to the very richest.BARTIROMO: Thank you senator.(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: But thats not an accurate description of the plan. Because, first of all, you may rename the IRS but you are not going to abolishes the IRS, because there has to be some agency thats going to collect your vat tax. Someones going to be collecting this tax.In fact, Ronald Reagans treasury, when Ronald Reagans treasury looked at the vat tax, you know what they found? That they were going to have to hire 20,000 new IRS agencies to collect it.The second point, it does not eliminate the corporate tax or the payroll tax. Businesses will now have to pay 16 percent on the money they make. They will also have to pay 16 percent on the money they pay their employees.So there are people watching tonight in business. If you are now hit on a 60 percent tax on both your income and on the wages you pay your employees, where are you going to get that money from? Youre going to get it by paying your employees less and charging your customers more, that is a tax, the difference is, you dont see it on the bill.And thats why Ronald Reagan said that it was a blindfold. You blindfold the American people so that they cannot see the true cost of government. Now 16 percent is what the rate Ted wants it at. But what happens if, God forbid, the next Barack Obama takes over, and the next Nancy Pelosi, and the next Harry Reid...(BELL RINGS)and they decide, were going to raise it to 30 percent, plus were going to raise the income tax to 30 percent. Now, youve got Europe.(CROSSTALK)BARTIROMO: Thank you senator. I have to get to a question for Mr. Trump.CRUZ: Maria...BARTIROMO: Yes.CRUZ: Maria, Id just like to say...(CROSSTALK)CHRISTIE: Maria, Id like to interrupt this debate on the floor of the Senate to actually answer the question you asked, which was on entitlements. Do you remember that, everybody? This was a question on entitlements.And the reason  and the reason...(CROSSTALK)CHRISTIE: ... no, you already had your chance, Marco, and you blew it. Heres the thing.(CROSSTALK)CHRISTIE: The fact is, the reason why...RUBIO: If youll answer the (inaudible) core question.CHRISTIE: ... the fact is  the fact is the reason why that no one wants to answer entitlements up here is because its hard. Its a hard problem. And Im the only one up on this stage who back in April put forward a detailed entitlement reform plan that will save over $1 trillion, save Social Security, save Medicare, and avoid this  avoid what Hillary Rodham Clinton will do to you.Because what she will do is come in and she will raise Social Security taxes. Bernie Sanders has already said it. And she is just one or two more poll drops down from even moving further left than shes moved already to get to the left of Bernie on this.We have seniors out there who are scared to death because this Congress  this one that we have right now, just stole $150 billion from the Social Security retirement fund to give it to the Social Security disability fund. A Republican Congress did that.And the fact is it was wrong. And they consorted with Barack Obama to steal from Social Security. We need to reform Social Security. Mine is the only plan that saves over $1 trillion and thats why Im answering your question.BARTIROMO: Thank you, Governor. Thank you, Governor.(APPLAUSE) CARSON: Can I just add one very quick thing? And I just want to say, you know, last week we released our tax plan. And multiple reputable journals, including The Wall Street Journal, said ours is the best. Just want to get that out there, just saying.BARTIROMO: Thank you, Dr. Carson.Coming up, how would the candidates protect America, and another terror attack, if we were to see it. But first, you can join us live on stage during the commercial break right from home. Go to facebook.com/foxbusiness. Well be streaming live and answering your questions during this break next.More from South Carolina coming up. Stay with us.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO: Mr. Trump, your net worth is in the multi-billions of dollars and have an ongoing thriving hotel and real estate business. Are you planning on putting your assets in a blind trust should you become president? With such vast wealth, how difficult will it be for you to disentangle yourself from your business and your money and prioritize Americas interest first?TRUMP: Well, its an interesting question because Im very proud of my company. As you too know, I know I built a very great company. But if I become president, I couldnt care less about my company. Its peanuts.I want to use that same up here, whatever it may be to make America rich again and to make America great again. I have Ivanka, and Eric and Don sitting there. Run the company kids, have a good time. Im going to do it for America.So I would  I would be willing to do that.BARTIROMO: So youll put your assets in a blind trust?TRUMP: I would put it in a blind trust. Well, I dont know if its a blind trust if Ivanka, Don and Eric run it. If thats a blind trust, I dont know. But I would probably have my children run it with my executives and I wouldnt ever be involved because I wouldnt care about anything but our country, anything.BARTIROMO: Thank you sir.TRUMP: Thank you.CAVUTO: Governor Christie, going back to your U.S. Attorney days, you had been praised by both parties as certainly a tough law and order guy. So I wonder what you make of recent statistics that showed violent crimes that have been spiking sometimes by double digit ratings in 30 cities across the country. Milwaukee Police Chief Ed Flynn said, most local law enforcement officials feel abandoned by Washington. Former NYC Police Chief Ray Kelly, says that, police are being less proactive because theyre being overly scrutinized and second guessed and theyre afraid of being sued or thrown in jail.What would you do as president to address this?CHRISTIE: Well, first off, lets face it, the FBI director James Comey was a friend of mine who I worked with as U.S. Attorney of New Jersey. He was the U.S. Attorney in Manhattan. He said, theres a chill wind blowing through law enforcement in this country. Heres why, the president of the United States and both his attorneys general, they give the benefit of the doubt to the criminal, not to the police officers.Thats the truth of the matter and you see it every time with this president. Every time hes got a chance, going all the way back to  remember that Great Beer Summit he had after he messed up that time. This is a guy who just believes that law enforcement are the bad guys.Now, I for seven years was the U.S. Attorney of New Jersey. I worked hard with not only federal agents but with police officers and heres the problem, sanctuary cities is part of the problem in this country. Thats where crime is happening in these cities where they dont enforce the immigration laws. And this president turns his back  this president doesnt enforce the marijuana laws in this country because he doesnt agree with them.And he allows states to go ahead and do whatever they want on a substance thats illegal. This president allows lawlessness throughout this country. Heres what I would do Neil, I would appoint an Attorney General and I would have one very brief conversation with that Attorney General. Id say, General, enforce the law against everyone justly, fairly, and aggressively. Make our streets safe again. Make our police officers proud of what they do but more important than that, let them know how proud we are of them.We do that, this country would be safe and secure again not only from criminals but from the terrorist who threaten us as well. Im the only person on this stage whos done that and we will get it done as President of the United States.CAVUTO: Thank you governor.Governor Kasich, as someone has to deal with controversial police shootings in your own state, what do you make of Chicagos move recently to sort of retrain police? Maybe make them not so quick to use their guns?KASICH: Well, I created a task force well over a year ago and the purpose was to bring law enforcement, community people, clergy and the person that I named as one of the co-chair was a lady by the name of Nina Turner, a former State Senator, a liberal Democrat. She actually ran against one of my friends and our head of public safety. KASICH: And they say down as a group trying to make sure that we can begin to heal some of these problems that we see between community and police.KASICH: And they came back with 23 recommendations. One of them is a statewide use of deadly force. And it is now being put into place everyplace across the state of Ohio. Secondly, a policy on recruiting and hiring, and then more resources for  for training.But let me also tell you, one of the issues has got to be the integration of both community and police. Community has to understand that that police officer wants to get home at night, and not  not to lose their life. Their family is waiting for them.At the same time, law enforcement understands there are people in the community who not only think that the system doesnt work for them, but works against them.See, in Ohio, weve had some controversial decisions. But the leaders have come forward to realize that protest is fine, but violence is wrong. And it has been a remarkable situation in our state. And as president of the United States, its all about communication, folks. Its all about getting people to listen to one anothers problems.And when you do that, you will be amazed at how much progress you can make, and how much healing we can have. Because, folks, at the end of the day, the country needs healed. Ive heard a lot of hot rhetoric here tonight, but Ive got to tell you, as somebody that actually passed a budget; that paid down a half-a-trillion dollars of our national debt, you cant do it alone. Youve got to bring people together. Youve got to give people hope.And together, we can solve these problems that hurt us and heal America. And that is whats so critical for our neighborhoods, our families, our children, and our grandchildren.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Thank you, Governor.BARTIROMO: Senator Rubio?(APPLAUSE)Under current law, the U.S. is on track to issue more new permanent immigrants on green cards over the next five years than the entire population of South Carolina. The CBO says your 2013 immigration bill would have increased green cardholders by another 10 million over 10 years.Why are you so interested in opening up borders to foreigners when American workers have a hard enough time finding work?RUBIO: Well, first of all, this is an issue thats been debated now for 30 years. And for 30 years, the issue of immigration has been about someone whos in this country, maybe theyre here illegally, but theyre looking for a job. This issue is not about that anymore.First and foremost, this issue has to be now more than anything else about keeping America safe. And heres why. There is a radical jihadist group that is manipulating our immigration system. And not just green cards. Theyre looking  theyre recruiting people that enter this country as doctors and engineers and even fiances. They understand the vulnerabilities we have on the southern border.Theyre looking  theyre looking to manipulate our  the visa waiver countries to get people into the United States. So our number one priority must now become ensuring that ISIS cannot get killers into the United States. So whether its green cards or any other form of entry into America, when Im president if we do not know who you are or why you are coming, you are not going to get into the United States of America.BARTIROMO: So your thinking has changed?RUBIO: The issue is a dramatically different issue than it was 24 months ago. Twenty-four months ago, 36 months ago, you did not have a group of radical crazies named ISIS who were burning people in cages and recruiting people to enter our country legally. They have a sophisticated understanding of our legal immigration system and we now have an obligation to ensure that they are not able to use that system against us.The entire system of legal immigration must now be reexamined for security first and foremost, with an eye on ISIS. Because theyre recruiting people to enter this country as engineers, posing as doctors, posing as refugees. We know this for a fact. Theyve contacted the trafficking networks in the Western Hemisphere to get people in through the southern border. And they got a killer in San Bernardino in posing as a fiance.This issue now has to be about stopping ISIS entering the United States, and when Im president we will.BARTIROMO: Thank you, Senator.(APPLAUSE)CRUZ: But Maria, radical Islamic terrorism was not invented 24 months ago; 24 months ago, we had Al Qaida. We had Boko Haram. We had Hamas. We had Hezbollah. We had Iran putting operatives in South America and Central America. Its the reason why I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King and led the fight to stop the Gang of Eight amnesty bill, because it was clear then, like its clear now, that border security is national security.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Thank you, Senator.CRUZ: It is also the case that that Rubio-Schumer amnesty bill, one of the things it did is it expanded Barack Obamas power to let in Syrian refugees. It enabled him  the president to certify them en masse without mandating meaningful background checks.I think thats a mistake. Thats why Ive been leading the fight to stop it. And I would note the Senate just a few weeks ago voted to suspend refugees from Middle Eastern countries. I voted yes to suspend that. Marco voted on the other side. So you dont get to say we need to secure the borders, and at the same time try to give Barack Obama more authority to allow Middle Eastern refugees coming in, when the head of the FBI tells us they cannot vet them to determine if they are ISIS terrorists.RUBIO: Maria, let me clear something up here. This is an interesting point when you talk about immigration. RUBIO: Ted Cruz, you used to say you supported doubling the number of green cards, now you say that youre against it. You used to support a 500 percent increase in the number of guest workers, now you say that youre against it. You used to support legalizing people that were here illegally, now you say youre against it. You used to say that you were in favor of birthright citizenship, now you say that you are against it.And by the way, its not just on immigration, you used to support TPA, now you say youre against it. I saw you on the Senate floor flip your vote on crop insurance because they told you it would help you in Iowa, and last week, we all saw you flip your vote on ethanol in Iowa for the same reason.(APPLAUSE)That is not consistent conservatism, that is political calculation. When I am president, I will work consistently every single day to keep this country safe, not call Edward Snowden, as you did, a great public servant. Edward Snowden is a traitor. And if I am president and we get our hands on him, he is standing trial for treason.(APPLAUSE)And one more point, one more point. Every single time that there has been a Defense bill in the Senate, three people team up to vote against it. Bernie Sanders, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz. In fact, the only budget you have ever voted for, Ted, in your entire time in the Senate is a budget from Rand Paul that brags about how it cuts defense.Heres the bottom line, and Ill close with this. If Im president of the United States and Congress tries to cut the military, I will veto that in a millisecond.(APPLAUSE)BUSH: Theres  look, theres CAVUTO: Gentlemen, gentlemen CRUZ: Im going to get a response to that, Neil. Theres no way he launches 11 attack CAVUTO: Very quick, very quick. CRUZ: Im going to  he had no fewer than 11 attacks there. I appreciate your dumping your (inaudible) research folder on the debate stage.RUBIO: No, its your record.CRUZL But I will say CAVUTO: Do you think they like each other?CRUZ:  at least half of the things Marco said are flat-out false. Theyre absolutely false.AUDIENCE: Boo.CRUZ: So lets start  lets start with immigration. Lets start with immigration and have a little bit of clarity. Marco stood with Chuck Schumer and Barack Obama on amnesty. I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King. Marco stood today, standing on this stage Marco supports legalization and citizenship for 12 million illegals. I opposed and oppose legalization and citizenship.And by the way, the attack he keeps throwing out on the military budget, Marco knows full well I voted for his amendment to increase military spending to $697 billion. What he said, and he said it in the last debate, its simply not true. And as president, I will rebuild the military and keep this country safe.CAVUTO: All right, gentlemen, weve got to stop. I know you are very passionate about that.(APPLAUSE)Governor Bush, fears have gripped this country obviously, and you touched on it earlier since the San Bernardino attacks. Since our last debate, the national conversation has changed, according to Facebook data as well.Now this first graphic shows the issues that were most talked about right before those attacks and now after: the issues of Islam, homeland security and ISIS now loom very large. The FBI says Islamic radicals are using social media to communicate and that it needs better access to communication. Now the CEO of Apple, Governor, Tim Cook said unless served with a warrant private communication is private, period. Do you agree, or would you try to convince him otherwise?BUSH: I would try to convince him otherwise, but this last back and forth between two senators  back bench senators, you know, explains why we have the mess in Washington, D.C. We need a president that will fix our immigration laws and stick with it, not bend with the wind.The simple fact is one of the ways, Maria, to solve the problem you described is narrow the number of people coming by family petitioning to what every other country has so that we have the best and the brightest that come to our country. We need to control the border, we need to do all of this in a comprehensive way, not just going back and forth and talking about stuff CAVUTO: Would you answer this question?BUSH: Oh, Ill talk about that, too. But you havent asked me a question in a while, Neil, so I thought Id get that off my chest if you dont mind.(LAUGHTER)CAVUTO: Fair enough. So Tim Cook  so Tim Cook says hes going to keep it private.BUSH: I got that. And the problem today is theres no confidence in Washington, D.C. There needs to be more than one meeting, there needs to complete dialogue with the large technology companies. They understand that theres a national security risk. We ought to give them a little bit of a liability release so that they share data amongst themselves and share data with the federal government, theyre not fearful of a lawsuit.We need to make sure that we keep the country safe. This is the first priority. The cybersecurity challenges that we face, this administration failed us completely, completely. Not just the hacking of OPM, but that is  that is just shameful. 23 million files in the hands of the Chinese? So its not just the government  the private sector companies, its also our own government that needs to raise the level of our game.We should put the NSA in charge of the civilian side of this as well. That expertise needs to spread all across the government and there needs to be much more cooperation with our private sector.CAVUTO: But if Tim cook is telling you no, Mr. President.BUSH: Youve got to keep asking. Youve got to keep asking because this is a hugely important issue. If you can encrypt messages, ISIS can, over these platforms, and we have no ability to have a cooperative relationship CAVUTO: Do you ask or do you order? BUSH: Well, if the law would change, yeah. But I think there has to be recognition that if we  if we are too punitive, then youll go to other  other technology companies outside the United States. And what we want to do is to control this.We also want to dominate this from a commercial side. So theres a lot of balanced interests. But the president leads in this regard. Thats what we need. We need leadership, someone who has a backbone and sticks with things, rather than just talks about them as though anything matters when youre talking about amendments that dont even actually are part of a bill that ever passed.CAVUTO: Governor, thank you.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: When we come right back, closing statements. Stay with us.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO: Welcome back.Candidates, it is time for your closing statements. You get 60 seconds each.Governor John Kasich, we begin with you.KASICH: You know, in our country, there are a lot of people who feel as though they just dont have the power. You know, they feel like if they dont have a lobbyist, if theyre not wealthy, that somehow they dont get to play.But all of my career, you know, having been raised in  by a mailman father whose father was a coal miner, who died of black lung and was losing his eyesight; or a mother whose mother could barely speak English. You see, all of my career, Ive fought about giving voice to the people that I grew up with and voice to the people that elected me.Whether its welfare reform and getting something back for the hard-earned taxpayers; whether its engaging in Pentagon reform and taking on the big contractors that were charging thousands of dollars for hammers and screw drivers and ripping us off; or whether its taking on the special interests in the nursing home industry in Ohio, so that mom and dad can have the ability to stay in their own home, rather than being forced into a nursing home.Look, thats who I stand up for. Thats whos in my mind(BELL RINGS)And if you really want to believe that you can get your voice back, I will tell you, as I have all my career, I will continue to fight for you, because youre the ones that built this country, and will carry it into the future. Thank you.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Governor Bush?BUSH: Who can you count on to keep us safer, stronger and freer? Results count, and as governor, I pushed Florida up to the top in terms of jobs, income and small business growth.Detailed plans count, and I believe that the plan Ive laid out to destroy ISIS before the tragedies of San Bernardino and Paris are the right ones.Credibility counts. Therell be people here that will talk about what theyre going to do. Ive done it. I ask for your support to build, together, a safer and stronger America.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Governor Chris Christie?CHRISTIE: Maria, Neil, thank you for a great debate tonight.When I think about the folks who are out there at home tonight watching, and I think about what they had to watch this week  the spectacle they had to watch on the floor of the House of Representatives, with the president of the United States, who talked a fantasy land about the way theyre feeling.They know that this country is not respected around the world anymore. They know that this country is pushing the middle class, the hardworking taxpayers, backwards, and they saw a president who doesnt understand their pain, and doesnt have any plan for getting away from it.I love this country. Its the most exceptional country the world has ever known. We need someone to fight for the people. We need a fighter for this country again.Ive lived my whole life fighting  fighting for things that I believe in, fighting for justice and to protect people from crime and terrorism, fighting to stand up for folks who have not had enough and need an opportunity to get more, and to stand up and fight against the special interests.But heres the best way that were going to make America much more exceptional: it is to make sure we put someone on that stage in September who will fight Hillary Clinton and make sure she never, ever gets in the White House again.I am the man who can bring us together to do that, and I ask for your vote.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Dr. Ben Carson?CARSON: You know, in recent travels around this country, Ive encountered so many Americans who are discouraged and angry as they watch our freedom, our security and the American dream slipping away under an unresponsive government that is populated by bureaucrats and special interest groups.Were not going to solve this problem with traditional politics. The only way were going to solve this problem is with we, the people. And I ask you to join me in truth and honesty and integrity. Bencarson.com  we will heal, inspire and revive America for our children.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Senator Marco Rubio?RUBIO: You know, 200 years ago, America was founded on this powerful principle that our rights dont come from government. Our rights come from God.Thats why we embraced free enterprise, and it made us the most prosperous people in the history of the world. Thats why we embraced individual liberty, and we became the freest people ever, and the result was the American miracle.But now as I travel the country, people say what I feel. This country is changing. It feels different. We feel like were being left behind and left out.And the reason is simple: because in 2008, we elected as president someone who wasnt interested in fixing America. We elected someone as president who wants to change America, who wants to make it more like the rest of the world.And so he undermines the Constitution, and he undermines free enterprise by expanding government, and he betrays our allies and cuts deals with our enemies and guts our military. And thats why 2016 is a turning point in our history. If we elect Hillary Clinton, the next four years will be worse than the last eight, and our children will be the first Americans ever to inherit a diminished country.But if we elect the right person  if you elect me  we will turn this country around, we will reclaim the American dream and this nation will be stronger and greater than it has ever been.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Senator Ted Cruz?CRUZ: 13 Hours  tomorrow morning, a new movie will debut about the incredible bravery of the men fighting for their lives in Benghazi and the politicians that abandoned them. I want to speak to all our fighting men and women.I want to speak to all the moms and dads whose sons and daughters are fighting for this country, and the incredible sense of betrayal when you have a commander-in-chief who will not even speak the name of our enemy, radical Islamic terrorism, when you have a commander-in- chief who sends $150 billion to the Ayatollah Khamenei, whos responsible for murdering hundreds of our servicemen and women.I want to speak to all of those maddened by political correctness, where Hillary Clinton apologizes for saying all lives matter. This will end. It will end on January 2017.And if I am elected president, to every soldier and sailor and airman and marine, and to every police officer and firefighter and first responder who risk their lives to keep us safe, I will have your back.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Mr. Donald Trump?TRUMP: I stood yesterday with 75 construction workers. Theyre tough, theyre strong, theyre great people. Half of them had tears pouring down their face. They were watching the humiliation of our young ten sailors, sitting on the floor with their knees in a begging position, their hands up.And Iranian wise guys having guns to their heads. It was a terrible sight. A terrible sight. And the only reason we got them back is because we owed them with a stupid deal, $150 billion. If Im president, there wont be stupid deals anymore.We will make America great again. We will win on everything we do. Thank you.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Candidates, thank you.CAVUTO: Gentlemen," thank you all. All of you. That wraps up our debate. We went a little bit over here. But we wanted to make sure everyone was able to say their due. Hes upset. All right. Thank you for joining us. Much more to come in the Spin Room ahead.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
21,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/18/us/politics/transcript-of-the-democratic-presidential-debate.html,1/18/16,"Following is a transcript of the Democratic debate, as transcribed by the Federal News Service.HOLT: Good evening and welcome to the NBC News Youtube Democratic candidates debate. After all the campaigning, soon, Americans will have their say with the first votes of the 2016 campaign just 15 days away in Iowa.HOLT: And New Hampshire not far behind.Tonight will be the final opportunity to see these candidates face to face before the voting begins. Our purpose here tonight is to highlight and examine the differences among the three Democratic candidates. So lets get started.Please welcome Secretary Hillary Clinton, Senator Bernie Sanders and Governor Martin OMalley.(APPLAUSE)Well, welcome to all of you. Hope youre excited, were excited. We want to thank our hosts, the Congressional Black Caucus Institute. Im joined by my colleague Andrea Mitchell tonight. The rules are simple. Sixty seconds for answers, 30 seconds for follow-ups or rebuttals. I know youll all keep exactly to time, so our job should be pretty easy here tonight. Well have questions from the Youtube community throughout the debate.This is a critical point in the race. Youve been defining your differences with each other especially vigorously in the last week on the campaign trail. Were here to facilitate this conversation on behalf of the voters so that they know exactly where you stand as you face off tonight. Lets have a great debate.Well begin with 45 second opening statements from each candidate, starting with Secretary Clinton.CLINTON: Well, good evening. And I want to thank the Congressional Black Caucus Institute and the people of Charleston for hosting us here on the eve of Martin Luther King Day tomorrow.You know, I remember well when my youth minister took me to hear Dr. King. I was a teenager. And his moral clarity, the message that he conveyed that evening really stayed with me and helped to set me on a path to service. I also remember that he spent the last day of his life in Memphis, fighting for dignity and higher pay for working people.And that is our fight still. We have to get the economy working and incomes rising for everyone, including those who have been left out and left behind. We have to keep our communities and our country safe. We need a president who can do all aspects of the job.I understand that this is the hardest job in the world. Im prepared and ready to take it on and I hope to earn your support to be the nominee of the Democratic Party and the next president of the United States.(APPLAUSE)HOLT: Thank you. Senator Sanders, your opening statement, sir.SANDERS: Thank you. As we honor the extraordinary life of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., its important not only that we remember what he stood for, but that we pledge to continue his vision to transform our country. As we look out at our country today, what the American people understand is we have an economy thats rigged, that ordinary Americans are working longer hours for lower wages, 47 million people living in poverty, and almost all of the new income and wealth going to the top one percent.SANDERS: And then, to make a bad situation worse, we have a corrupt campaign finance system where millionaires and billionaires are spending extraordinary amounts of money to buy elections.This campaign is about a political revolution to not only elect the president, but to transform this country.HOLT: Senator, thank you.(APPLAUSE)And Governor OMalley, your opening statement, sir.OMALLEY: Thank you. My name is Martin OMalley, I was born the year Dr. King delivered his I Have A Dream speech.And I want to thank the people of South Carolina, not only for hosting our debate here tonight, but also for what you taught all of us in the aftermath of the tragic shooting at Mother Emanuel Church.You taught us, in fact, in keeping with Dr. Kings teaching, that love would have the final word when you took down the Confederate flag from your state house; let go of the past and move forward.Eight years ago, you brought forward a new leader in Barack Obama to save our country from the second Great Depression. And thats what hes done. Our countrys doing better, were creating jobs again.But in order to make good on the promise of equal opportunity and equal justice under the law, and we have urgent work to do, and the voices of anger and fear and division that weve heard coming off of the Republican presidential podiums are pretty loud.We need new leadership. We need to come together as a people and build on the good things that President Obama has done.Thats why Im running for president. I need your help, I ask for your vote, and I look forward to moving our country forward once again.Thank you.HOLT: All right. And Governor, thank you.(APPLAUSE)HOLT: All right, to our first question, now. The first question, Ill be addressing to all of the candidates.President Obama came to office determined to swing for the fences on health care reform. Voters want to know how you would define your presidency? How would you think big? So complete this sentence: in my first 100 days in office, my top three priorities will be  fill in the blank.Senator Sanders.SANDERS: Well, thats what our campaign is about. It is thinking big. It is understanding that in the wealthiest country in the history of the world, we should have health care for every man, woman, and child as a right that we should raise the minimum wage to at least $15 an hour; that we have got to create millions of decent- paying jobs by rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure.So, what my first days are about is bringing America together, to end the decline of the middle class, to tell the wealthiest people in this country that yes, they are going to start paying their fair share of taxes, and that we are going to have a government that works for all of us, and not just big campaign contributors.(APPLAUSE)HOLT: Secretary Clinton, same question, my first 100 days in office, my top three priorities will be.CLINTON: I would work quickly to present to the Congress my plans for creating more good jobs in manufacturing, infrastructure, clean and renewable energy, raising the minimum wage, and guaranteeing, finally, equal pay for womens work.I would also...(APPLAUSE)I would also be presenting my plans to build on the Affordable Care Act and to improve it by decreasing the out-of-pocket costs by putting a cap on prescription drug costs; by looking for ways that we can put the prescription drug business and the health insurance company business on a more stable platform that doesnt take too much money out of the pockets of hard-working Americans.And third, I would be working, in every way that I knew, to bring our country together. We do have too much division, too much mean- spiritedness. Theres a lot we have to do on immigration reform, on voting rights, on campaign finance reform, but we need to do it together. Thats how well have the kind of country for the 21st century that we know will guarantee our children and grandchildren the kind of future they deserve.(APPLAUSE)HOLT: Governor OMalley, same question.OMALLEY: Thank you. First of all, I would lay out an agenda to make wages go up again for all Americans, rather than down. Equal pay for equal work, making it easier rather than harder for people to join labor unions and bargain collectively for better wages; getting 11 million of our neighbors out of the underground shadow economy by passing comprehensive immigration reform, raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, however we can, wherever we can.Secondly, I believe the greatest business opportunity to come to the United States of America in 100 years is climate change. And I put forward a plan to move us to a 100 percent clean electric energy grid by 2050 and create 5 million jobs along the way.(APPLAUSE)HOLT: Thank you. Youve all...OMALLEY: Finally  Im sorry, that was second, Lester.OMALLEY: And third and finally, we need a new agenda for Americas cities. We have not had a new agenda for Americas cities since Jimmy Carter. We need a new agenda for America cities that will invest in the talents and skills in our people, that will invest in CBVG transportation, infrastructure and transit options, and make our cities the leading edge in this move to a redesigned built clean green energy future that will employ our people.HOLT: All right governor thank you.Weve all laid out large visions and were going to cover a lot of the ground you talked about as we continue in the evening. The last couple of weeks of this campaign have featured some of the sharpest exchanges in the race. Lets start with one of them, the issue of guns.Senator Sanders, last week Secretary Clinton called you quote, a pretty reliable vote for the gun lobby. Right before the debate you changed your position on immunity from lawsuits for gun manufacturers, can you tell us why?SANDERS: Well, I think Secretary Clinton knows that what she says is very disingenuous. I have a D-minus voting record from the NRA. I was in 1988, there were three candidates running for congress in the state of Vermont, I stood up to the gun lobby and came out and maintained the position that in this country we should not be selling military style assault weapons.I have supported from day one and instant background check to make certain that people who should have guns do not have guns. And that includes people of criminal backgrounds, people who are mentally unstable. I support what President Obama is doing in terms of trying to close the gun show loop holes and I think it should be a federal crime if people act as dormant (ph).We have seen in this city a horrendous tragedy of a crazed person praying with people in the coming up and shooting nine people. This should not be a political issue. What we should be doing is working together.And by the way, as a senator from a rural state that has virtually no gun control, I believe that I am in an excellent position to bring people together to fight the sensible...HOLT: Senator, but you didnt answer the question that you did change your position on immunity from gun manufacturers. So can you...SANDERS: What I have said, is that gun manufacturers liability bill has some good provisions among other things, weve prohibited ammunition that wouldve killed cops who had protection on. We have child safety protection work on guns in that legislation. And what we also said, is a small mom and pop gun shop who sells a gun legally to somebody should not be held liable if somebody does something terrible with that gun.So what I said is,  I would re-look at it. We are going to re- look at it and I will support stronger provisions.HOLT: Secretary Clinton, would you like to respond to Senator Sanders.CLINTON: Yes look, I have made it clear based on Senator Sanders own record that he has voted with the NRA, with the gun lobby numerous times. He voted against the Brady Bill five times. He voted for what we call, the Charleston Loophole. He voted for immunity from gunmakers and sellers which the NRA said, was the most important piece of gun legislation in 20 years. He voted to let guns go onto the Amtrak, guns go into National Parks. He voted against doing research to figure out how we can save lives. Lets not forget what this is about, 90 people a day die from gun violence in our country. Thats 33,000 people a year.One of the most horrific examples not a block from here where we had nine people murdered. Now, I am pleased to hear that Senator Sanders has reversed his position on immunity and I look forward to him joining with those members of congress who have already introduced legislation. There is no other industry in America that was given the total pass that the gun makers and dealers were and that needs to be reversed.HOLT: All right, Governor OMalley, you signed tough gun control measures as governor of Maryland and there are a lot Democrats in the audience here in South Carolina who own guns. This conversation might be worrying many of them. They may be hearing, you want to take my guns. What would you say to them?OMALLEY: This is what I would say Lester, look see, Ive listened to Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders go back and forth on which of them has the most inconsistent record on gun safety legislation and I would have to agree with both of them. Theyve both been inconsistent when it comes to this issue.OMALLEY: Im the one candidate on this stage that actually brought people together to pass comprehensive gun safety legislation. This is very personal to me being from Baltimore. I will never forget one occasion visiting a little boy in Johns Hopkins Hospital, he was getting a birthday haircut, the age of three when drug dealers turned that barbershop into a shooting gallery and that boys head was pierced with a bullet. And I remember visiting him, it did not kill him - I remember visiting him and his mother in Johns Hopkins Hospital. He was getting a birthday haircut, the age of three when drug dealers turned that barbershop into a shooting gallery, and that boys head was pierced with a bullet.And, I remember visiting him, it did not kill him. I remember visiting him and his mother in Johns Hopkins Hospital. In his diapers (ph) with tubes running in and out of his head, same age as my little boy.So, after the slaughter of the kids in Connecticut last year, we brought people together. We did pass in our state comprehensive gun safety legislation. It did have a ban on combat assault weapons, universal background checks, and you know what? We did not interrupt a single persons hunting season.Ive never met a self respecting deer hunter that needed an AR-15 to down a deer. And, so...(APPLAUSE)... were able to actually do these things.HOLT: Alright, Governor, thank you.Secretary Clinton, this is a community that has suffered a lot of heartache in the last year. Of course, as you mentioned, the church shootings. We wont forget the video of Walter Scott being shot in the back while running from police.We understand that a jury will decide whether that police officer was justified, but it plays straight to the fears of many African American men that their lives are cheap. Is that perception, or in your view, is it reality?CLINTON: Well, sadly its reality, and it has been heartbreaking, and incredibly outraging to see the constant stories of young men like Walter Scott, as you said, who have been killed by police officers. Their needs to be a concerted effort to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system.And, that requires a very clear, agenda for retraining police officers, looking at ways to end racial profiling, finding more ways to really bring the disparities that stalk our country into high relief.One out of three African American men may well end up going to prison. Thats the statistic. I want people hear to think what we would be doing if it was one out of three white men, and very often, the black men are arrested, convicted and incarcerated ...(APPLAUSE)...for offensive that do not lead to the same results for white men.So, we have a very serious problem that we can no longer ignore.HOLT: You time is up.Senator Sanders, my next question is...SANDERS: ...Well, I  look...HOLT: ... Its actually  actually my next question is to you...SANDERS: ... Let me respond to what the secretary said. We have a criminal justice system which is broken. Who in America is satisfied that we have more people in jail than any other country on Earth, including China? Disproportionately African American, and Latino. Who is satisfied that 51% of African American young people are either unemployed, or underemployed? Who is satisfied that millions of people have police records for possessing marijuana when the CEOs of Wall Street companies who destroyed our economy have no police records.(APPLAUSE)HOLT: Senator Sanders...SANDERS: ... We need to take a very hard look at our...HOLT: Senator. Senator Sanders...SANDERS: ... criminal justice system, investing in jobs, and education not in jails and incarceration .HOLT: ... Just over a week ago the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus endorsed Secretary Clinton, not you. He said that choosing her over you was not a hard decision. In fact, our polling shows shes beating you more than two to one among minority voters. How can you be the nominee if you dont have that support?SANDERS: Well, let me talk about polling.(LAUGHTER) SANDERS: As Secretary Clinton well knows, when this campaign began she was 50 points ahead of me. We were all of three percentage points. Guess what?In Iowa, New Hampshire, the race is very, very close. Maybe were ahead New Hampshire.(CHEERING)SANDERS: In terms of polling, guess what? We are running ahead of Secretary Clinton. In terms of taking on my taking on my good friend, Donald Trump, beating him by 19 points in New Hampshire, 13 points in the last national poll that we saw.To answer your question. When the African American community becomes familiar with my Congressional record and with our agenda, and with our views on the economy, and criminal justice  just as the general population has become more supportive, so will the African American community, so will the Latino community. We have the momentum, were on a path to a victory.(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)OMALLEY: Lester, I (inaudible)HOLT: Governor, Im going to come to you in a second.Google searches for the words, Black Lives Matter surpassed, civil rights movement. And, here in South Carolina, black lives matter was the number one trending political issue.HOLT: Governor OMalley, youve campaigned on your record as governor of Maryland, and before that, the mayor of Baltimore. Last year, of course, Baltimore was rocked by violent unrest in the wake of the death of Freddie Gray.And right from the start of your campaign, youve been dogged by those who blame your tough-on-crime, so-called zero tolerance policies as mayor for contributing to that unrest. What responsibility do you bear?OMALLEY: Yes, lets talk about this. When I ran for mayor in 1999, Lester, it was not because our city was doing well. It was because we were burying over 300 young, poor black men every single year.And thats why I ran, because, yes, black lives matter. And we did a number of things. We werent able to make our city immune from setbacks as the Freddie Gray unrest and tragic death showed.But we were able to save a lot of lives doing things that actually worked to improve police and community relations. The truth of the matter is, we created a civilian review board. And many of these things are in the new agenda for criminal justice reform that Ive put forward.We created a civilian review board, gave them their own detectives. We required the reporting of discourtesy, use of excessive force, lethal force. I repealed the possession of marijuana as a crime in our state.I drove our incarceration rate down to 20-year lows, and drove violent crime down to 30-year lows, and became the first governor south of the Mason-Dixon line to repeal the death penalty.I feel a responsibility every day to find things that work...(APPLAUSE)HOLT: All right. Lets talk...OMALLEY: ... and to do more of them to reform our criminal justice system.HOLT: Lets talk more about policing and the criminal justice system. Senator Sanders, a few times tonight were going to hear from some of the most prominent voices on YouTube, starting with Franchesca Ramsey, who tackles racial stereotypes through her videos. Lets watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)FRANCHESCA RAMSEY: Hey, Im Franchesca Ramsey. I believe theres a huge conflict of interest when local prosecutors investigate cases of police violence within their own communities.For example, last month, the officers involved in the case of 12- year-old Tamir Rice werent indicted. How would your presidency ensure that incidents of police violence are investigated and prosecuted fairly?(END VIDEO CLIP)HOLT: Senator Sanders.SANDERS: I apologize for not hearing all of that question.HOLT: Would you like me to read it back to you?SANDERS: Yes.HOLT: Prosecutors  I believe theres a huge conflict of interest when local prosecutors investigate cases of police violence within their communities. Most recently, we saw this with a non- indictment of the officers involved in the case of 12-year-old Tamir Rice. How would you presidency ensure incidents of police violence are investigated and prosecuted fairly?SANDERS: Absolutely. This is a responsibility for the U.S. Justice Department to get involved. Whenever anybody in this country is killed while in police custody, it should automatically trigger a U.S. attorney generals investigation.(APPLAUSE)Second of all, and I speak as a mayor who worked very closely and well with police officers, the vast majority of whom are honest, hard- working people trying to do a difficult job, but let us be clear.If a police officer breaks the law, like any public official, that officer must be held accountable.(APPLAUSE)And thirdly, we have got to de-militarize our police departments so they dont look like occupying armies. Weve got to move toward community policing.And fourthly, we have got to make our police departments look like the communities they serve in their diversity.(APPLAUSE)HOLT: Secretary Clinton, this question is for you. Tonight parts of America are in the grip of a deadly heroin epidemic, spanning race and class, hitting small towns and cities alike. It has become a major issue in this race.In a lot of places where youve been campaigning, despite an estimated trillion dollars spent, many say the war on drugs has failed. So what would you do?CLINTON: Well, Lester, youre right. Everywhere I go to campaign, Im meeting families who are affected by the drug problem that mostly is opioids and heroin now, and lives are being lost and children are being orphaned. And Ive met a lot of grandparents who are now taking care of grandchildren.So I have tried to come out with a comprehensive approach that, number one, does tell the states that we will work with you from the federal government putting more money, about a billion dollars a year, to help states have a different approach to dealing with this epidemic.The policing needs to change. Police officers must be equipped with the antidote to a heroin overdose or an opioid overdose, known as Narcan. They should be able to administer it. So should firefighters and others.We have to move away from treating the use of drugs as a crime and instead, move it to where it belongs, as a health issue. And we need to divert more people from the criminal justice system into drug courts, into treatment, and recovery.HOLT: And thats time. CLINTON: So this is the kind of approach that we should take in dealing with what is now...HOLT: Senator...CLINTON: ... a growing epidemic.HOLT: Senator Sanders, would you like to respond?SANDERS: Sure. I agree...(APPLAUSE)I agree with everything the Secretary said, but let me just add this, there is a responsibility on the part of the pharmaceutical industry and the drug companies who are producing all of these drugs and not looking at the consequence of it.And second of all, when we talk about addiction being a disease, the Secretary is right, what that means is we need a revolution in this country in terms of mental health treatment. People should be able to get the treatment that they need when they need it, not two months from now, which is why I believe in universal...HOLT: Thats...SANDERS: ... healthcare with mental health...HOLT: ... time.SANDERS: ... a part of that.HOLT: Were going to get into all that coming up.OMALLEY (?): Lester, just ten seconds.HOLT: But were going to take a break and we need to take a break...OMALLEY (?): Just 10 seconds. All of the things...HOLT: ... and when we come back, the anger brewing in America.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HOLT: Welcome back to Charleston. Lets turn to another area where there has been fierce disagreement  that would be health care.Senator Sanders and Secretary Clinton, you both mentioned it in your 100-day priorities.Lets turn to my colleague, Andrea Mitchell now to lead that questioning.MITCHELL: Thank you, Lester.Secretary Clinton, Senator Sanders favors what he calls Medicare for all. Now, you said that what he is proposing would tear up Obamacare and replace it.Secretary Clinton, is it fair to say to say that Bernie Sanders wants to kill Obamacare?CLINTON: Well, Andrea, I am absolutely committed to universal health care. I have worked on this for a long time, people may remember that I took on the health insurance industry back in the 90s, and I didnt quit until we got the childrens health insurance program that ensures eight million kids.And I certainly respect Senator Sanders intentions, but when youre talking about health care, the details really matter. And therefore, we have been raising questions about the nine bills that he introduced over 20 years, as to how they would work and what would be the impact on peoples health care?He didnt like that, his campaign didnt like it either. And tonight, hes come out with a new health care plan. And again, we need to get into the details. But heres what I believe, the Democratic Party and the United States worked since Harry Truman to get the Affordable Care Act passed.We finally have a path to universal health care. We have accomplished so much already. I do not to want see the Republicans repeal it, and I dont to want see us start over again with a contentious debate. I want us to defend and build on the Affordable Care Act and improve it.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: OK.MITCHELL: Senator Sanders?SANDERS: Secretary  Secretary Clinton didnt answer your question.(LAUGHTER)Because what her campaign was saying  Bernie Sanders, who has fought for universal health care for my entire life, he wants to end Medicare, end Medicaid, end the childrens health insurance program. That is nonsense.What a Medicare-for-all program does is finally provide in this country health care for every man, woman and child as a right. Now, the truth is, that Frank Delano Roosevelt, Harry Truman, do you know what they believed in? They believed that health care should be available to all of our people.Im on the committee that wrote the Affordable Care Act. I made the Affordable Care Act along with Jim Clyburn a better piece of legislation. I voted for it, but right now, what we have to deal with is the fact that 29 million people still have no health insurance. We are paying the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs, getting ripped off.And heres the important point, we are spending far more per person on health care than the people of any other country. My proposal, provide health care to all people, get private insurance out of health insurance, lower the cost of health care for middle class families by 5,000 bucks.Thats the vision we need to take.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: But  Senator Sanders, if I can...(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: You know, I have to say Im not sure whether were talking about the plan you just introduced tonight, or were talking about the plan you introduced nine times in the Congress. But the fact is, we have the Affordable Care Act. That is one of the greatest accomplishments of President Obama, of the Democratic Party, and of our country.(APPLAUSE)And we have already seen 19 million Americans get insurance. We have seen the end of pre-existing conditions keeping people from getting insurance.(APPLAUSE)We have seen women no longer paying more for our insurance than men. And we have seen young people, up to the age of 26, being able to stay on their parents policy.SANDERS: But  what if we have...CLINTON: Now, there are things we can do to improve it, but to tear it up and start over again, pushing our country back into that kind of a contentious debate, I think is the wrong direction.SANDERS: It is  it is absolutely inaccurate.OMALLEY: I have to talk about something thats actually working in our state.MITCHELL: Governor  Governor Sanders...SANDERS: No one is tearing this up, were going to go forward. But with the secretary neglected to mention, not just the 29 million still have no health insurance, that even more are underinsured with huge copayments and deductibles.Tell me why we are spending almost three times more than the British, who guarantee health care to all of their people? Fifty percent more than the French, more than the Canadians. The vision from FDR and Harry Truman was health care for all people as a right in a cost-effective way.Were not going to tear up the Affordable Care Act. I helped write it. But we are going to move on top of that to a Medicaid-for- all system.OMALLEY: Andrea  Andrea  Andrea.(CROSSTALK)(APPLAUSE)OMALLEY: Instead of  Andrea, I think, instead of attacking one another on health care, we should be talking about the things that are actually working.In our state, we have moved to an all-payer system. With the Affordable Care Act, we now have moved all of our acute care hospitals, that driver of cost at the center, away from fee-for- service.And actually to pay, we pay them based on how well they keep patients out of the hospital. How well they keep their patients. Thats the future. We need to build on the Affordable Care Act, do the things that work, and reduce costs and increase access.(CROSSTALK)CLINTON: And thats exactly what we are able to do based on the foundation of the Affordable Care Act  what Governor OMalley just said is one of the models that we will be looking at to make sure we do get costs down, we do limit a lot of the unnecessary costs that we still have in the system.But, with all due respect, to start over again with a whole new debate is something that I think would set us back. The Republicans just voted last week to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and thank goodness, President Obama vetoed it and saved Obamacare for the American people.(APPLAUSE)MITCHELL: Senator Sanders, let me ask you this, though...SANDERS: Yeah.MITCHELL: ... youve talked about Medicare for all...SANDERS: Yes.MITCHELL: .. and tonight youve released a very detailed plan, just two... SANDERS: Not all that detailed.MITCHELL: ... well, two hours before the debate, you did.SANDERS: Well.MITCHELL: But let me ask you about Vermont. Because in Vermont  you tried in the state of Vermont, and Vermont walked away from this kind of idea, of  of Medicare for all, single-payer, because they concluded it would require major tax increases...SANDERS: Well, thats  you might want to ask...MITCHELL: ... and by some estimates, it would double the budget. If you couldnt sell it in Vermont, Senator...SANDERS: Andrea, let me just say this.MITCHELL: ... how can you sell it to the country?SANDERS: Let me just say that you might want to ask the governor of the state of Vermont why he could not do it. Im not the governor. Im the senator from the state of Vermont.(LAUGHTER)But second of all  second of all...(APPLAUSE)... here is what the real point is, in terms of all of the issues youve raised  the good questions youve raised. You know what it all comes down to?Do you know why we cant do what every other country  major country on Earth is doing? Its because we have a campaign finance system that is corrupt, we have super PACs, we have the pharmaceutical industry pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into campaign contributions and lobbying, and the private insurance companies as well.What this is really about is not the rational way to go forward  its Medicare for all  it is whether we have the guts to stand up to the private insurance companies and all of their money, and the pharmaceutical industry.

s what this debate should be about.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: Well, as someone who  as someone who has a little bit of experience standing up to the health insurance industry, that spent, you know...(APPLAUSE)... many, many millions of dollars attacking me, and probably will so again, because of what I believe we can do building on the Affordable Care Act, I think its important to point out that there are a lot of reasons we have the health care system we have today.I know how much money influences the political decision-making. Thats why Im for huge campaign finance reform. However, we started a system that had private health insurance.And even during the Affordable Care Act debate, there was an opportunity to vote for what was called the public option. In other words, people could buy in to Medicare, and even when the Democrats were in charge of the Congress, we couldnt get the votes for that.So, what Im saying is really simple. This has been the fight of the Democratic Party for decades. We have the Affordable Care Act. Lets make it work.Lets take the models that states are doing. We now have driven costs down to the lowest theyve been in 50 years. Now weve got to get individual costs down. Thats what Im planning to do.HOLT: And thats time (ph). Were gonna take a turn now.Secretary Clinton, in his final State of the Union address, President Obama said his biggest regret was his inability to bring the country together. If President Obama couldnt do it, how will you?OMALLEY: Great question.CLINTON: Well, I think its an important point the president made in his State of the Union. And heres what I would say. I will go anywhere, to meet with anyone, at any time to find common ground.Thats what I did as a first lady, when I worked with both Democrats and Republicans to get the Childrens Health Insurance Program, when I worked with Tom DeLay, one of the most partisan of Republicans, to reform the adoption and foster care system.What I did, working in the Senate, where I crossed the aisle often, working even with the senator from South Carolina, Lindsey Graham, to get Tricare for national guardsmen and women.And its what I did as Secretary of State, on numerous occasions, and most particularly, rounding up two-thirds votes in order to pass a treaty that lowered the nuclear weapons in both Russia and the United States. CLINTON: So I know its hard, but I also know youve got to work at it every single day. I look out here, I see a lot of my friends from the Congress. And I know that they work at it every single day.Because maybe you cant only find a little sliver of common ground to cooperate with somebody from the other party, but who knows. If youre successful there, maybe you can build even more. Thats what I would do.HOLT: Thats time. Senator Sanders, response.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: A couple of years ago, when we understood that veterans were not getting the quality care they needed in the timely manner, I worked with folks like John McCain and others to pass the most comprehensive veterans health care legislation in modern history.But let me rephrase your question because I think, in all do respect, youre expression. In all do respect, youre missing the main point. And the main point in the Congress, its not the Republicans and Democrats hate each other.Thats a mythology from the media. The real issue is that Congress is owned by big money and refuses to do what the American people want them to do.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: The real issue is that in area after area, raising the minimum wage to $15 bucks an hour. The American people want it. Rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, creating 13 million jobs, the American people want it. The pay equity for women, the American people want it. Demanding that the wealthy start paying their fair share of taxes. The American people want it.HOLT: Thats time. But let me continue with the...SANDERS: The point is, we have to make Congress respond to the needs of the people, not big money.HOLT: Senator Sanders, let me continue, you call yourself a Democratic socialist...SANDERS: I do. HOLT: And throughout your career in politics, youve been critical of the Democratic party, youve been saying in a book you wrote, quote, There wasnt a hell of a big difference between the the two major parties. How would you will a general election...SANDERS: Did I say that?HOLT: How will you win a general election labeling yourself a democratic socialist?SANDERS: Because of what I believe in what I was just saying. The Democratic party needs major reform. To those of you in South Carolina, you know what, in Mississippi, we need a 50-state strategy so that people in South Carolina and Mississippi can get the resources that they need.Instead of being dependent on super PACs, what we need is to be dependent on small, individual campaign contributors. We need an agenda that speaks to the needs of working families and low-income people. Not wealthy campaign contributors.HOLT: Yes, but senator, you can...SANDERS: We need to expand what the input into the Democratic party. I am very proud that in this campaign, we have seen an enormous amount of excitement from young people, from working people. We have received more individual contributions than any candidate in the history of this country up to this point.(APPLAUSE)OMALLEY: Yes, but senator you never came to campaign for Vincent Sheheen when he was running for governor. In fact, neither of you came to campaign for Vincent Sheheen when he was running for governor.(APPLAUSE)HOLT: We can talk all we want about wanting to build a stronger Democratic party, but Lester, the question you answered, its no laughing matter.The most recurring question I get when I stand on the chair all across Iowa and talk with my neighbors is, how are you going to heal the divisions and the wounds in our country? This is the biggest challenge we face as a people.All my life, I brought people together over deep divides and very old wounds, and thats what we need now in a new leader. We cannot keep talking past each other, declaring all Republicans are our enemies or the war is all about being against millionaires or billionaires, or its all against American Muslims, all against immigrants.Look, as Frederick Douglas said, we are one, our cause is one, and we must help each other if we are going to succeed. HOLT: And that is right.SANDERS: And I respectfully disagree.HOLT: Secretary Clinton, our next question is for you. Heres another quantitative problem.SANDERS: And I respectfully disagree with my friend over here. And that is, you are right. All of us have denounced Trumps attempts to divide this country: the anti-Latino rhetoric, the racist rhetoric, he anti-Muslim rhetoric.But where I disagree with you, Governor OMalley, is I do believe we have to deal with the fundamental issues of a handful of billionaires...OMALLEY: I agree with that.SANDERS: ... who control economic and political life of this country.OMALLEY: I agree.SANDERS: Nothing real will get happened. Unless we have a political revolution. Where millions of people finally stand up.HOLT: And were going to get into that coming up. But Secretary Clinton, heres a question from YouTube. Its from a young video blogger who has over 5 million subscribers. He has a question about the importance of younger voters.FRANTA: Hi, Im Connor Franta, Im 23 and my audience is around the same age. Getting my generation to vote should be a priority for any presidential candidate.Now I know Senator Sanders is pretty popular among my peers, but what I want to know is, how are all of you planning on engaging us further in this election?HOLT: Secretary Clinton.CLINTON: Well thanks for the question and congratulations on five million viewers on YouTube, thats quite an accomplishment. Look, this election is mostly about the future and therefore it is of greatest urgency for young people.Ive laid out my ideas about what we can do to make college affordable; how we can help people pay off their student debts and save thousands of dollars, how we can create more good jobs because a lot of the young people that I talk with are pretty disappointed the economic prospects they feel their facing. So making community college free, making it possible to attend a public college or university with debt free tuition, looking for ways to protect our rights especially from the concerted Republican assault; on voting rights, on womens rights, on gay rights, on civil rights, on workers rights.And I know how much young people value their independence, their autonomy, and their rights. So I think this is an election where we have to pull young people and older people together to have a strategy about how were going to encourage even more Americans to vote because it absolutely clear to me...HOLT: Thats time...CLINTON: That turning over our White House to the Republicans would be bad for everybody especially young people.HOLT: A quick follow up  a thirty second follow up.Why is Senator Sanders beating you to 2 to 1 among younger votes?CLINTON: Look, I have the greatest respect for Senator Sanders and for his supports and Im going to keep working as hard as I can to reach as many people of all ages about what I will do, what the experience and the ideas that I have that I will bring to the White House and I hope to have their support when Im the Democratic nominee.HOLT: Were going to take...SANDERS: Is that your strategy...HOLT: Were going to take a break. When we come back; big banks, big business and big differences among the three candidates on the American Economy. Well be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)HOLT: Welcome back from Charleston. Lets turn now to the economy.Senator Sanders, you released a tough new ad last week in which without mentioning Secretary Clinton by name, you talk about two Democratic visions for regulating Wall Street. One says its OK to take millions from big banks and tell them what to do. My plan, break up the big banks, close the tax loopholes and make them pay their fair share.What do you see as the difference between what you would do about the banks and what Secretary Clinton would do?SANDERS: Well, the first difference is I dont take money from big banks. I dont get personal speaking fees from Goldman Sachs. What I would do...(APPLAUSE)What I would do is understand that when you have three out of the four largest banks today, bigger than they were when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail, when you have the six largest financial institutions having assets of 60 percent of the GDP of America, it is very clear to me what you have to do.Youve got to bring back the 21st century Glass-Steagall legislation and youve got to break up these huge financial institutions. They have too much economic power and they have too much financial power over our entire economy. If Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, the old Republican trust buster, what he would say is these guys are too powerful. Break them up. I believe thats what the American people to want see. Thats my view.HOLT: Secretary Clinton, help the voter understand the daylight between the two of you here.CLINTON: Well, theres no daylight on the basic premise that there should be no bank too big to fail and no individual too powerful to jail. We agree on that. But where we disagree is the comments that Senator Sanders has made that dont just affect me, I can take that, but hes criticized President Obama for taking donations from Wall Street, and President Obama has led our country out of the great recession. Senator Sanders called him weak, disappointing. He even, in 2011, publicly sought someone to run in a primary against President Obama. Now, I personally believe that President Obamas work to push through the Dodd-Frank...(LAUGHTER)The Dodd-Frank bill and then to sign it was one of the most important regulatory schemes weve had since the 1930s. So Im going to defend Dodd-Frank and Im going to defend President Obama for taking on Wall Street, taking on the financial industry and getting results.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: OK. First of all...HOLT: Senator Sanders, your response.SANDERS: Set the record right. In 2006 when I ran for the Senate, Senator Barack Obama was kind enough to campaign for me,2008, I did my best to see that he was elected and in 2012, I worked as hard as I could to see that he was reelected. He and I are friends. Weve worked together on many issues. We have some differences of opinion.But here is the issue, Secretary touched on it, can you really reform Wall Street when they are spending millions and millions of dollars on campaign contributions and when they are providing speaker fees to individuals? So its easy to say, well, Im going to do this and do that, but I have doubts when people receive huge amounts of money from Wall Street. SANDERS: I am very proud, I do not have a super PAC. I do not want Wall Streets money. Ill rely on the middle class and working families...HOLT: Thats time.Governor OMalley...(CROSSTALK)SANDERS: ... campaign contributions.HOLT: I have a question for you...(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: You know, I think since  since Senator Standers followed up on this...HOLT: Thirty-second response.CLINTON: Your profusion of comments about your feelings towards President Obama are a little strange given what you said about him in 2011.But look, I have a plan that most commentators have said is tougher, more effective, and more comprehensive.OMALLEY: Thats not true.CLINTON: It builds on the Dodd-Frank  yes, it is. It builds on the Dodd-Frank, regulatory scheme...OMALLEY: Its just not true.CLINTON: ... but it goes much further, because...OMALLEY: Oh, come on.CLINTON: ... both the governor and the senator have focused only on the big banks. Lehman Brothers, AIG, the shadow banking sector were as big a problem in what caused the Great Recession, I go after them.And I can tell you that the hedge fund billionaires who are running ads against me right now, and Karl Rove, who started running an ad against me right now, funded by money from the financial services sector, sure thing, Im the one they dont want to be up against.(APPLAUSE)HOLT: Governor OMalley.OMALLEY: Yes, thank you. Yes, Lester, what Secretary Clinton just said is actually not true. What  I have put forward a plan that would actually put cops back on the beat of Wall Street. I have put forward a plan that was heralded as very comprehensive and realistic.Look, if a bank robber robs a bank and all you do is slap him on the wrist, hes just going to keep robbing banks again. The same thing is true with people in suits.Secretary Clinton, I have a tremendous amount of respect for you, but for you to say theres no daylight on this between the three of us is also not true. I support reinstituting a modern version of Glass- Steagall that would include going after the shadow banks, requiring capital requirements that would force them to no longer put us on the hook for these sorts of things.In prior debates Ive heard you even bring up  I mean, now you bring up President Obama here in South Carolina in defense of the fact of your cozy relationship with Wall Street.In an earlier debate, I heard you bring up even the 9/11 victims to defend it. The truth of the matter is, Secretary Clinton, you do not go as far as reining in Wall Street as I would.And the fact of the matter is, the people of America deserve to have a president thats on their side, protecting the main street economy from excesses on Wall Street. And were just as vulnerable today.HOLT: Secretary Clinton, 30-second response.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: Yes, well, first of all  first of all, Paul Krugman, Barney Frank, others have all endorsed my plan. Secondly, we have Dodd-Frank. It gives us the authority already to break up big banks that pose...OMALLEY: And we have never used it.CLINTON: That pose a risk to the financial sector. I want to go further and add to that.And, you know, Governor, you have raised money on Wall Street. You raised a lot of money on Wall Street when you were the head of the Democratic Governors Association...OMALLEY: Yes, but I havent gotten a penny this year... CLINTON: And you were...OMALLEY: ... so somebody please, go on to martinomalley.com...(LAUGHTER)OMALLEY: Go on to martinomalley.com, send me your checks. Theyre not giving me  zero.CLINTON: Yes, well, the point is that if were going to be serious about this and not just try to score political points, we should know whats in Dodd-Frank, and whats in Dodd-Frank already gives the president the authority...(CROSSTALK)CLINTON: ... with his regulators to make those decisions.SANDERS: Let me give you an example of how corrupt  how corrupt this system is. Goldman Sachs recently fined $5 billion. Goldman Sachs has given this country two secretaries of treasury, one on the Republicans, one under Democrats.OMALLEY: Say it.SANDERS: The leader of Goldman Sachs is a billionaire who comes to Congress and tells us we should cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.Secretary Clinton  and youre not the only one, so I dont mean to just point the finger at you, youve received over $600,000 in speaking fees from Goldman Sachs in one year.I find it very strange that a major financial institution that pays $5 billion in fines for breaking the law, not one of their executives is prosecuted, while kids who smoke marijuana get a jail sentence.(APPLAUSE)HOLT: Thats time.Andrea.CLINTON: Well, the last point on this is, Senator Sanders, youre the only one on this stage that voted to deregulate the financial market in 2000, to take the cops off the street, to use Governor OMalleys phrase, to make the SEC and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission no longer able to regulate swaps and derivatives, which were one of the main cause of the collapse in 08.So theres plenty...SANDERS: If you want to...CLINTON: Theres plenty of problems that we all have to face together.And the final thing I would say, were at least having a vigorous debate about reining in Wall Street...HOLT: ... Senator...CLINTON: ... The Republicans want to give them more power, and repeal Dodd-Frank. Thats what we need to stop...(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: Anyone who wants to check my record in taking on Wall Street, in fighting against the deregulation of Wall Street when Wall Street put billions of dollars in lobbying, in campaign contributions to get the government off their backs. They got the government off their backs.Turns out that they were crooks, and they destroyed our economy. I think its time to put the government back on their backs.(APPLAUSE)MITCHELL: Senator Sanders  Senator Sanders, youve talked a lot about things you want to do. You want free education for everyone, you want the Federal Minimum Wage raised to $15 an hour. You want to expand Social Security...SANDERS: ... Yeah...MITCHELL: ... benefits. Youve been specific about what you want, but lets talk about how to pay for all this. You now said that you would raise taxes today, two hours or so ago, you said you would raise taxes to pay for your health care plan. You havent been specific about how to pay for the other things...SANDERS: ... Thats true.MITCHELL: ... Will you tell us tonight?SANDERS: Good. Youre right. I want to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, create 13 million jobs. We do that by doing away with the absurd loophole that now allows major profitable corporations to stash their money in the Cayman (ph) Islands, and not in some years, pay a nickel in taxes. Yes, I do. I plead guilty. I want every kid in this country who has the ability to be able to go to a public college, or university, tuition free. And, by the way, I want to substantially lower student debt interest rates in this country as well.How do I pay for it?(APPLAUSE)I pay for it through a tax on Wall Street speculation. This country, and the middle class, bailed out Wall Street. Now, it is Wall Streets time to help the middle class. In fact...OMALLEY: (inaudible)SANDERS: ... we have documented, unlike Secretary Clinton, I have documented exactly how I would pay for our ambitious agenda.OMALLEY: Andrea...MITCHELL: ... OK...OMALLEY: ... The only person on this stage who has...MITCHELL: ... Secretary Clinton, you mentioned earlier  Secretary Clinton, do you want to respond?CLINTON: Well, I have actually documented every way that Im going to pay for what Im doing because I think the American public deserves to know. And, you can go to my website and actually see that.But, there are serious questions about how were going to pay for what we want to see our country do. And, Im the only candidate standing here tonight who has said I will not raise taxes on the middle class. I want to raise incomes, not taxes, and Im going to do everything I can to make sure that the wealthy pay for debt free tuition, for child care, for paid family leave. To help us bring down student debt were going to refinance that student debt, saving kids thousands of dollars.Yeah, and that will also come out of the  some of the pockets of people in the financial services industry...MITCHELL: OK, were out of time. Senator Sanders,CLINTON: But I will tell you exactly how I pay for everything Ive proposed...(CROSSTALK)MITCHELL: Senator Sanders...SANDERS: ... Here is the main two points...MITCHELL: ... Senator Sanders, let me ask you a question about taxes. SANDERS: Yeah.MITCHELL: The most googled political issue...SANDERS: ... I got it.MITCHELL: In the last month was taxes. Now, in your healthcare plan, the plan you released tonight, you would not only raise taxes on the wealthy, but the details you released indicate you would raise taxes on the middle class also. Is that correct?SANDERS: What is correct, and Im disappointed that Secretary Clintons campaign has made this criticism. Its a Republican criticism. Secretary Clinton does know a lot about healthcare, and she understands, I believe, that a medicare for all, single payer program will substantially lower the cost of healthcare for middle class families. So, what we have got to acknowledge, and I hope the Secretary does, is we are doing away with private health insurance premiums.So, instead of paying $10,000 dollars to Blue Cross, or Blue Shield, yes, some middle class families would be paying slightly more in taxes, but the result would be that that middle class family would be saving some $5,000 dollars in healthcare costs. A little bit more in taxes, do away with private health insurance premiums. Its a pretty good deal.(APPLAUSE)MITCHELL: Senator  Senator, let me just follow up on that.SANDERS: Yeah.MITCHELL: On Meet the Press on December 20th, you said that you would only raise taxes on the middle class to pay for family leave. And, having said that, now you say youre going to raise middle class taxes to pay for healthcare as well. Is that breaking your word?SANDERS: No, it is not breaking my word. When you are  its one thing to say Im raising taxes, its another thing to say that we are doing away with private health insurance premiums.SANDERS: So, if I save you $10,000 in private health insurance, and you pay a little bit more in taxes in total, there are huge savings in what your family is spending.OMALLEY: Senator, Im the only person on this stage thats actually balanced a budget every year for 15 years.SANDERS: I was mayor for eight years, I did that as well.(LAUGHTER)OMALLEY: OK. So, that was eight years. Yes. And Senator, but I actually did it during a budget down time  I mean, during a recession.And Andrea, the  I had to make more cuts than any governor in the history of Maryland, but we invested more in infrastructure, more in transportation. We made our public schools more in America more than five years in a row, and went four years in a row without a pennys increase to college tuition.The things that we need to do in our country, like debt-free college in the next five years, like making universal  like making national service a universal option in order to cut youth unemployment in half in the next three years, all these things can be done if we eliminate one entitlement we can no longer afford as a nation.And that is the wealthy among us, those making more than a million dollars, feel that they are entitled to paying a much lower marginal tax rate than was usual for the better part of these 80 years.And if we tax earnings from investments on money  namely capital gains  at the same rate as we tax sweat and hard work and toil, we can make the investments we need to make to make our country better.HOLT: We have got a lot to ground to cover here.Many Democratic voters are passionate about the need to do something to combat the threat of climate change, including the team of scientists from Youtubes MinuteEarth channel.Heres their take.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANNOUNCER: Hello from MinuteEarth. Fossil fuels have long kept our cars moving and our light bulbs lit.But we know that burning these fuels releases heat-trapping gases that are warming the planet, causing seas to rise and contributing to extreme weather events, like South Carolinas devastating flooding last year.Fighting human-caused climate change means giving up our global addiction to fossil fuels and shifting the bulk of the worlds energy supply to alternative sources.Some countries have acted decisively to make this transition. But here at home, we still get a whooping 82 percent of our energy from coal, oil, and natural gas.In the U.S., political gridlock, pressure from industry lobbyists and insufficient R&D have made an already tough battle against climate change even tougher.(END VIDEO CLIP)HOLT: Senator Sanders, Americans love their SUVs, which spiked in sales last year as gas prices plummeted.How do you convince Americans that the problem of climate change is so urgent that they need to change their behavior?SANDERS: I think we already are. Younger generation understands it instinctively.I was home in Burlington, Vermont, on Christmas Eve, the temperature was 65 degrees. People in Vermont know whats going on. People who did ice fishing, where their ice is no longer there on the lake understand whats going on.Im on both the Environmental and Energy Committees. The debate is over. Climate change is real. It is already causing major problems. And if we do not act boldly and decisively, a bad situation will become worse.It is amazing to me, and I think well have agreement on this up here, that we have a major party, called the Republican Party that is so owned by the fossil fuel industry and their campaign contributions that they dont even have the courage, the decency to listen to the scientists.(APPLAUSE)It is beyond my comprehension how we can elect a president of the United States, somebody like Trump, who believes that climate change is a hoax invented by the Chinese.(LAUGHTER)Bottom line is, we need to be bold and decisive, we can create millions of jobs. We must, for the sake of our kids and grandchildren, transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy.Ive got the most comprehensive legislation in the Senate to do that. And as president, I will fight to make that happen.(APPLAUSE)HOLT: Governor OMalley, 30 seconds.OMALLEY: Thank you.Lester, on this stage tonight, this Democratic stage, where we actually believe in science.(LAUGHTER)I would like to challenge and invite my colleagues here on this stage to join me in putting forward a plan to move us to a 100 percent clean, electric energy grid by 2050. It can be done.(APPLAUSE)With solar, with wind, with new technologies, with green buildings, this can happen, but in all  President Obama made us more energy independent, but in all of the above strategy didnt land us on the moon, we need American ingenuity and we need to reach by 2050 for the sake of our kids.HOLT: Thats time. Were going to take a break.CLINTON: And let me...HOLT: When we return, the late-breaking developments regarding Iran. The threat of ISIS now more real than ever on U.S. soil. Americans in fear and hearing few good answers.Well be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)TODD: And we are back. Im Chuck Todd. We are just past the halfway mark in our NBC News YouTube Democratic Candidates Debate. Boy, this is one that has actually lived up to the billing.Weve seen some sharp exchanges on guns, health care and Wall Street  the debate, you could argue, that has been largely focused on all things Bernie Sanders.He was on the defensive early, Hillary Clinton getting, I think, some control on the gun issue. But on health care and on Wall Street reform, it was Hillary Clinton on the defensive, and was a very aggressive Bernie Sanders.One thing of note here: Bernie Sanders very much being the sort of revolutionary candidate, major change, and youve heard a lot of Hillary Clinton saying things like she wants to build on the things that President Obama did, wrapping herself in President Obama.Lets go back downstairs and check in with our moderators, Lester and Andrea. So whats coming up next, guys?HOLT: Well, weve covered a lot of ground already, but were gonna be talking about ISIS. A threat to America, its  always polls as one of the top concerns of Americans. And also some more late-breaking news.MITCHELL: We have all the news that has happened from Iran and the presidents comments today, as well as what this means going forward for the War on Terror. What do we expect from Iran, and also whats happening in Syria? So a lot of foreign policy coming up.HOLT: A lot of debate to come. Well be back in Charleston after this.TODD: Youve got it. Well, its the commander-in-chief test  thats whats next. Stay with us  the debate resumes right after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HOLT: Charleston, Andrea Mitchell has questions now starting with Iran.MITCHELL: Thank you Lester.Senator Sanders, the nuclear deal is now enforced. Iran is getting its billions of dollars, several Americans who have been held are now going to be heading home. The president said today, its a good day. Its a good day for diplomacy. Its a time now to restore diplomatic relations for the first time since 1979 and actually re- opened a U.S. Embassy in Tehran.SANDERS: I think what weve got to do is move as aggressively as we can to normalize relations with Iran. Understanding that Irans behavior in so many ways is something that we disagree with; their support terrorism, the anti-American rhetoric that were hearing from of their leadership is something that is not acceptable.On the other hand, the fact that weve managed to reach an agreement, something that Ive very strongly supported that prevents Iran from getting a nuclear weapon and we did that without going to war. And that I believe were seeing a fall in our relationships with Iran is a very positive step. So if your question is, do I want to see that relationship become more positive in the future? Yes.Can I tell that we should open an embassy in Tehran tomorrow? No, I dont think we should. But I think the goal has go to be as weve done with Cuba, to move in warm relations with a very powerful and important country in this world.MITCHELL: Your response Secretary Clinton?CLINTON: Well, Im very proud of the Iran Nuclear Agreement. I was very pleased to be part of what the president put into action when he took office. I was responsible for getting those sanctions imposed which put the pressure on Iran. It brought them to the negotiating table which resulted in this agreement.And so, they have been so far, following their requirements under the agreement. But I think we still have to carefully watch them. Weve had one good day over 36 year and I think we need more good days before we move more rapidly toward any kind of normalization. And we have to be sure that they are truly going to implement the agreement. And then, we have to go after them on a lot of their other bad behavior in the region which is causing enormous problems in Syria, Yemen, Iraq and elsewhere.MITCHELL: You mentioned Syria. Let me ask you about Syria, all of you. Lets turn to Syria and the civil war that has been raging there. Are there any circumstances in which you could see deploying significant numbers of ground forces in Syria, not just specials forces but significant ground forces to combat ISIS in a direct combat role?Let me start with you Secretary Clinton.CLINTON: Absolutely not.I have a three point plan that does not include American Ground forces. It includes the United States leading an air coalition which is what were doing, supporting fighters on the ground; the Iraqi Army which is beginning to show more ability, the Sunni fighters that we are now helping to reconstitute and Kurdish on both sides of the border.I think we also have try to disrupt their supply chain of foreign fighters and foreign money and we do have to contest them in online space. So Im very committed to both going after ISIS but also supporting what Secretary Kerry is doing to try to move on a political diplomatic to try to begin to slow down and hopefully end the carnage in Syria which is the root of so many of the problems that we seen in the region and beyond.MITCHELL: Senator Sanders, ground forces yes or no? SANDERS: As everybody you know, this is incredibly complicated and difficult issue and I applaud. I know President Obamas been getting a lot of criticism on this. I think he is doing the right thing.What the nightmare is, which many of my Republican colleagues appear to want is to not have learned the lesson of Iraq. To get American young men and women involved in perpetual warfare in the quagmire of Syria and the Middle East would be an unmitigated disaster that as president, I will do everything in my power to avoid.OMALLEY: Andrea...MITCHELL: Governor OMalley?SANDERS: We should  we should learn  we should learn from King Abdullah of Jordan, one of the few heroes in a very unheroic place. And what Abdullah said is this is a war with a soul of Islam and that Muslim troops should be on the ground with our support and the support of other major countries. That is how we destroy ISIS, not with American troops in perpetual warfare.MITCHELL: Governor OMalley.OMALLEY: Thank you.(APPLAUSE)Andrea, governors have led us to victory in two world wars by doing what America does best, and that is by joining forces with others by acting in coalition. And I believe that President Obama is doing the right thing in this case.We need to learn the lessons from the past. We do need to provide the special  special ops advisers, we need  do need to provide the technical support, but over the long-term, we need to develop new alliances. We need a much more proactive national security strategy that reduces these threats before they rise to a level where it feels like we need to pull for a division of marines.And I also want to add one other thing here. I appreciate the fact that in our debate, we dont use the term you hear Republicans throwing around trying to look all vibrato (ph) and macho sending other kids  kids into combat, they keep using the term boots on the ground. A woman in Burlington, Iowa said to me, Governor, when youre with your colleagues, please dont refer to my son who has served two tours of duty in Iraq as a pair of boots on the ground. Now, we need to be mindful of learning the lessons of the past.(APPLAUSE)MITCHELL: I have a question. I have a question for Senator Sanders. Did the policies of the Obama administration, in which Secretary Clinton of course was a part, create a vacuum in Iraq and Syria that helped ISIS grow?SANDERS: No. I think the vacuum was created by the disastrous war in Iraq, which I vigorously opposed. Not only did I vote against it, I helped lead the opposition. And what happened there is yes, its easy to get rid of a two-bit dictator like Saddam Hussein, but there wasnt the kind of thought as to what happens the day after you get him and what kind of political vacuum occurs. And who rises up? Groups like ISIS.So I think that President Obama made a promise to the American people when he ran, and he said you know what, Im going to do my best to bring American troops home. And I supported what he did. Our job is to train and provide military support for Muslim countries in the area who are prepared to take on ISIS.And one point I want to make here that is not made very often, you have incredibly wealthy countries in that region, countries like Saudi Arabia, countries like Qatar. Qatar happens to be the largest  wealthiest country per capita in the world. They have got to start putting in some skin in the game and not just ask the United States to do it.(APPLAUSE)MITCHELL: Secretary Clinton, I want to talk to you about red lines, because former Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said in a recent interview that President Obamas decision to stand down on planned missile strikes against Damascus after Assad had used chemical weapons hurt the presidents credibility. Should the president have stuck to his red line once he drew it?CLINTON: Look, I think that the presidents decision to go after the chemical weapons once there was a potential opportunity to build on when the Russians opened that door resulted in a very positive outcome. We were able to get the chemical weapons out.I know from my own experience as secretary of State that we were deeply worried about Assads forces using chemical weapons because it would have had not only a horrific affect on people in Syria, but it could very well have affected the surrounding states, Jordan, Israel, Lebanon, Turkey. So getting those chemical weapons out was a big deal, but...MITCHELL: But should he  should he have stuck to his...CLINTON: Well  but  but...MITCHELL: ... line? Did it hurt U.S. credibility? CLINTON: I think, as commander in chief, youve got to constantly be evaluating the decisions you have to make. I know a little bit about this, having spent many hours in the situation room, advising President Obama.And I want to just add to something that Senator Sanders said, the United States had a very big interest in trying to help stabilize the region. If there is any blame to be spread around, it starts with the prime minister of Iraq, who sectarianized his military, setting Shia against Sunni.It is amplified by Assad, who has waged one of the bloodiest, most terrible attacks on his own people: 250,000-plus dead, millions fleeing. Causing this vacuum that has been filled unfortunately, by terrorist groups, including ISIS.So, I think we are in the midst of great turmoil in this region. We have a proxy conflict going on between Saudi Arabia and Iran. You know, one of the criticisms Ive had of Senator Sanders is his suggestion that, you know, Iranian troops be used to try to end the war in Syria...MITCHELL: Your time is up.CLINTON: ... and go after ISIS, which I dont think would be a good idea.SANDERS: Let me just...MITCHELL: Senator....CLINTON: But overall, a lot of the forces at work in the region are ones that we cannot directly influence, but we can...MITCHELL: Youre out of time.SANDERS: OK. Let me suggest...(CROSSTALK)MITCHELL: Senator Sanders.SANDERS: Where Secretary Clinton and I think, I agree with most of what she said. But where I think we do have an honest disagreement, is that in the incredible quagmire of Syria, where its hard to know whos fighting who and if you give arms to this guy, it may end up in ISIS hand the next day. We all know that.And we all know, no argument, the secretary is absolutely right, Assad is a butcher of his own people, man using chemical weapons against his own people. This is beyond disgusting.But I think in terms of our priorities in the region, our first priority must be the destruction of ISIS. Our second priority must be getting rid of Assad, through some political settlement, working with Iran, working with Russia.But the immediate task is to bring all interests together who want to destroy ISIS, including Russia, including Iran, including our Muslim allies to make that the major priority.OMALLEY: But in all of that senator and secretary, I think were leaving out something very important here. And that is that we still dont have the human intelligence: overt, in terms of diplomatic intelligence or covert, to understand even what the heck happens as the secondary and tertiary effects of some of these things.We are walking through this region, Andrea, without the human intelligence that we need. And we need to make a renewed investment as a country in bringing up a new generation of foreign service officers, and bringing up a new generation of business people and actually understanding and having relationships in these places.So we have a better sense of what the heck happens after a dictator topples and can take action to prevent another safe haven and another iteration of terror.MITCHELL: Your time is us. Lester.HOLT: Senator Sanders mentioned Russia a moment ago. Secretary Clinton, you famously handed Russias foreign minister a reset button in 2009. Since then, Russia has annexed Crimea, fomented a war in Ukraine, provided weapons that downed an airliner and launched operations, as we just did discuss, to support Assad in Syria. As president, would you hand Vladimir Putin a reset button?CLINTON: Well, it would depend on what I got for it and I can tell you what we got in the first term, we got a new start treaty to reduce nuclear weapons between the United States and Russia. We got permission to resupply our troops in Afghanistan by traveling across Russia.We got Russia to sign on to our sanctions against Iran and other very important commitments. So look, in diplomacy, you are always trying to see how you can figure out the interest of the other to see if there isnt some way you can advance your security and your values.When Putin came back in the fall of 2011, it was very clear he came back with a mission. And I began speaking out as soon as that happened because there were some fraudulent elections held, and Russians poured out into the streets to demand their freedom, and he cracked down. And in fact, accused me of fomenting it. So we now know that he has a mixed record to say the least and we have to figure out how to deal with him.HOLT: Whats your relationship with him?CLINTON: Well, my relationship with him, its  its interesting.(LAUGHTER)Its one, I think, of respect. Weve had some very tough dealings with one another. And I know that hes someone that you have to continuingly stand up to because, like many bullies, he is somebody who will take as much as he possibly can unless you do.And we need to get the Europeans to be more willing to stand up, I was pleased they put sanctions on after Crimea and eastern Ukraine and the downing of the airliner, but weve got to be more united in preventing Putin from taking a more aggressive stance in Europe and the Middle East.(APPLAUSE)HOLT: We to want turn right now to the issue of balancing national security concerns with the privacy rights of Americans. That brings us to YouTube and this question.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BROWNLEE: Hi, my name Marques Brownlee, and Ive been making YouTube videos about electronics and gadgets for the past seven years.I think Americas future success is tied to getting all kinds of tech right. Tech companies are responsible for the encryption technology to protect personal data, but the government wants a back door into that information.So do you think its possible to find common ground? And where do you stand on privacy versus security?(END VIDEO CLIP)HOLT: So, Governor OMalley.OMALLEY: Thank you.I believe whether its a back door or a front door that the American principle of law should still hold that our federal government should have to get a warrant, whether they want to come through the back door or your front door.(APPLAUSE)And I also agree, Lester, with Benjamin Franklin, who said, no people should ever give up their privacy or their freedoms in a promise for security.So were a collaborative people. We need collaborative leadership here with Silicon Valley and other bright people in my own state of Maryland and around the NSA that can actually figure this out.But there are certain immutable principles that will not become antique things in our country so long as we defend our country and its values and its freedoms. And one of those things is our right to be secure in our homes, and our right to expect that our federal government should have to get a warrant.I also want to the say that while weve made some progress on the Patriot Act, I do believe that we need an adversarial court system there. We need a public advocate. We need to develop jurisprudence so that we can develop a body of law that protects the privacy of Americans in the information and digital age.HOLT: Thats time.You have all talked about what you would do fighting ISIS over there, but weve been hit in this country by home-grown terrorists, from Chattanooga to San Bernardino, the recent shooting of a police officer in Philadelphia. How are you going to fight the lone wolves here, Senator Sanders?OMALLEY: Yes, Lester, year in and year out I was the leader of the U.S. ...HOLT: Thats a question to Senator Sanders. I wasnt clear, I apologize.SANDERS: OK. I just wanted to add, in the previous question, I voted against the USA Patriot Act for many of the reasons that Governor OMalley mentioned. But it is not only the government that we have to worry about, it is private corporations.You would all be amazed, or maybe not, about the amount of information private companies and the government has in terms of the Web sites that you access, the products that you buy, where you are this very moment.And it is very clear to me that public policy has not caught up with the explosion of technology. So yes, we have to work with Silicon Valley to make sure that we do not allow ISIS to transmit information...HOLT: But in terms of lone wolves, the threat, how would you do it?SANDERS: Right. What we have got to do there is, among other things, as I was just saying, have Silicon Valley help us to make sure that information being transmitted through the Internet or in other ways by ISIS is, in fact, discovered.But I do believe we can do that without violating the constitutional and privacy rights of the American people.(CROSSTALK)HOLT: We have to go to a  we have to go to a break, and when we come back, were going to get to some of the burning questions these candidates have yet to answer and are totally eager to talk about.CLINTON: Oh, were breaking? OK.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)HOLT: And welcome back to Charleston.As we were going to a break, Secretary Clinton, I cut you off. Ill give you 30 seconds to respond on the issue of lone wolves.OMALLEY: Can I get 30 seconds, too?(LAUGHTER)SANDERS: Can I get 50 seconds?HOLT: Secretary Clinton.CLINTON: Well, I wanted to say, and Ill do it quickly, I was very pleased that leaders of President Obamas administration went out to Silicon Valley last week and began exactly this conversation about what we can do, consistent with privacy and security.We need better intelligence cooperation, we need to be sure that we are getting the best intelligence that we can from friends and allies around the world. And then, weve got to recognize our first line of defense against lone wolf attacks is among Muslim Americans.And it is not only shameful, it is dangerous for the kinds of comments youre hearing from the Republican side.We need to be reaching out and unifying our country against terrorist attacks and lone wolves, and working with Muslim Americans.(APPLAUSE)HOLT: And Andrea has a follow-up.OMALLEY: And Andrea  Andrea  Andrea...MITCHELL: Just a  just a quick follow-up, though, Secretary Clinton. Just a moment, Governor.OMALLEY: Andrea, when can I get my 30 seconds?MITCHELL: But  but  Secretary Clinton, you said that the leaders from the intelligence community went to Silicon Valley, they were flatly turned down. They got nowhere.CLINTON: That is not what Ive heard. Let me leave it at that.OMALLEY: Andrea, I need to talk about homeland security and preparedness.Ever since the attacks of September 11th  30 seconds.(LAUGHTER)Ever since the attacks of September 11th, my colleagues, Democratic and Republican mayors, Democratic and Republican governors, made me their leader on homeland security and preparedness.OMALLEY: Here in the homeland, unlike combating ISIL abroad, were almost like its  your bodys immune system. Its able to protect your body against bad bugs, not necessarily because it outnumbers them, but its better connected  the fusion centers, the biosurveillance systems, better prepared first responders.But theres another front in this battle, and it is this. Thats the political front, and if Donald Trump wants to start a registry in our country of people by faith, he can start with me, and I will sign up as one who is totally opposed to his fascist appeals that wants to vilify American Muslims. That can do more damage to our democracy than any...(CROSSTALK)HOLT: All right, thats time, and  and we do...(APPLAUSE)... we do have to move on.Secretary Clinton, this is the first time...SANDERS: Can I get a  can I just get a very brief response? Very brief.HOLT: Thirty  30  30 seconds, Senator.SANDERS: OK. One  and I agree with what the secretary said, and what Governor OMalley said. But heres an issue that we also should talk about. We have a $600 billion military budget. It is a budget larger than the next eight countries.Unfortunately, much of that budget continues to fight the old Cold War with the Soviet Union. Very little of that budget  less than 10 percent  actually goes into fighting ISIS and international terrorism. We need to be thinking hard about making fundamental changes in the priorities of the Defense Department.HOLT: All right. Secretary Clinton...(APPLAUSE)... this is the first time that a spouse of a former president could be elected president. You have said that President Clinton would advise you on economic issues, but be specific, if you can. Are you talking about a kitchen-table role on economics, or will he have a real policy role?CLINTON: Well, itll start at the kitchen table, well see how it goes from there. And I...(APPLAUSE)... Im going to have the very best advisers that I can possibly have, and when it comes to the economy and what was accomplished under my husbands leadership and the 90s  especially when it came to raising incomes for everybody and lifting more people out of poverty than at any time in recent history  you bet.Im going to ask for his ideas, Im going ask for his advice, and Im going use him as a goodwill emissary to go around the country to find the best ideas weve got, because I do believe, as he said, everything thats wrong with America has been solved somewhere in America.We just have to do more of it, and we have to reach out, especially into poor communities and communities of color, to give more people their own chance to get ahead.HOLT: Senator sanders, a 30 second response, sir.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: Great ideas, Governor OMalley, Secretary Clinton, but heres the truth. If you have an administration stacked with Wall Street appointees, it aint going to accomplish very much.So heres a promise that I make  and I mentioned a moment ago how corrupt the system is  Goldman Sachs, paying a $5 billion fine, gives this country, in recent history, a Republican secretary of treasury, a Democratic secretary of treasury.Heres a promise. If elected president, Goldman Sachs is not going to have  bring forth a secretary of treasury for a Sanders administration.(APPLAUSE)MILLER: Senator Sanders, let me ask you a question. You called Bill Clintons past transgressions, quote, totally, totally, totally disgraceful and unacceptable. Senator, do you regret saying that?SANDERS: I was asked a question. You know, one of the things, Andrea, and I  that question annoys me. I cannot walk down the street  Secretary Clinton knows this  without being told how much I have to attack secretary Clinton, want to get me on the front pages of the paper, Id make some vicious attack.I have avoided doing that. Trying to run an issue-oriented campaign.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: I was asked a question.MILLER: You didnt have to answer it that way, though. Why did you?SANDERS: Well  then if I dont answer it, then theres another front page, so its yes (ph).(LAUGHTER)And I mean this seriously. You know that. Weve been through this. Yes, his behavior was deplorable. Have I ever once said a word about that issue? No, I have not. Im going to debate Secretary Clinton, Governor OMalley, on the issues facing the American people, not Bill Clintons personal behavior.(APPLAUSE)HOLT: We will take a break. Well continue from Charleston right after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK) HOLT: Welcome back everybody. Finally, before we go tonight, we set out here to understand points of differences between you. We believe weve learned a lot here, but before we leave, is there anything that you really wanted to say tonight that you havent gotten a chance to say.And, well start with Governor OMalley.(LAUGHTER)HOLT: Didnt see that coming, did you?OMALLEY: Yes, but were going to have to get 20 minutes to do it, so.(LAUGHTER)MITCHELL: ...too long (ph).OMALLEY: I believe there are many issues. I have 60 seconds for this?HOLT: Sixty seconds, wed appreciate it.OMALLEY: There are so many issues that we havent been able to discuss here. We have not fully discussed immigration reform, and the deplorable number of immigrant detention camps that our nations now maintaining. We havent discussed the shameful treatment that the people of Puerto Rico, our fellow Americans, are getting treated with by these hedge funds that are working them over.(APPLAUSE)OMALLEY: We havent discussed the fact that in our hemisphere we have the danger of nation-state failures because of drug traffickers; and Honduras, and Guatemala and El Salvador.I guess the bottom line is this, look we are a great people the way we act at home and abroad based on the beliefs that unite us. Our belief in the dignity of every person, our belief in our own common good. There is now challenge that is too great for us to overcome provided we bring forward in these divided times, new leadership that can heal our divides here at home and bring our principles into alignment abroad.Were on the threshold of a new era of American progress and I believe we have only need to join forces together and cross that threshold into a new era of American prosperity.HOLT: And thats time.OMALLEY: Thanks a lot.HOLT: Secretary Clinton?CLINTON: Well Lester, I spent a lot of time last week being outraged by whats happening in Flint, Michigan and I think every single American should be outraged. Weve had a city in the United States of America where the population which is poor in many ways and majority African American has been drinking and bathing in lead contaminated water. And the governor of that state acted as though he didnt really care.He had request for help and he had basically stone walled. Ill tell you what, if the kids in a rich suburb of Detroit had been drinking contaminated water and being bathed in it, there wouldve been action.So I sent my top campaign aide down there to talk to the mayor of Flint to see what I could to help. I issued a statement about what we needed to do and then I went on a T.V. show and I said, it was outrageous that the governor hadnt acted and within two hours he had.HOLT: And thats time.CLINTON: I want to be a president who takes care of the big problems and the problems that are affecting the people of our country everyday.(APPLAUSE)HOLT: Thank you.Senator Sanders?SANDERS: Well, Secretary Clinton was right and what I did which I think is also right, is demanded the resignation of governor. A man who acts that irresponsibly should not stay in power.Now, we are a great nation  and weve heard a lot of great ideas here tonight. Lets be honest and lets be truthful. Very little is going to be done to transform our economy and to create the kind of middle class we need unless we end a corrupt campaign finance system which is undermining American democracy.Weve got to get rid of Super PACs, weve got to get rid of Citizens United and what weve got to do is create a political revolution which revitalizes American democracy; which brings millions of young people and working people into the political process. To say loudly and clearly, that the government of the United States of America belongs to all of us and not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors.HOLT: All right. Well thank you and thanks to all of you for being here tonight shedding light on some of the differences as Americans get ready to vote.I also want to thank the Congressional Black Caucus Institute and certainly my friend and colleague, Andrea Mitchell. This has been great. Its been a great spirited conversation and American people appreciate it.Let me turn it over to my friend Chuck Todd now. Chuck?TODD: Lester thank you and a terrific job moderating this debate tonight, Andrea as well. What a lively substantive debate. We thought there were going to be fireworks, there certainly were.You heard sort of the sharp disagreements when it comes to guns, when it comes to Wall Street Reform, when it comes to health care and even a few things on foreign policy. Were going to break all of it down here in a few minutes but were going to try to sneak in a short break.And when we come back, instant analysis. Well see if we can find out what the campaigns are doing. Were live right here in the spin room in Charleston," South Carolina.END""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
22,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/29/us/politics/republican-presidential-debate-transcript.html,1/29/16,"Following is a transcript of the main Republican debate, as transcribed by the Federal News Service.BRET BAIER: Nine p.m. on the East Coast. Eight oclock here in Des Moines, Iowa. Welcome to the seventh Republican presidential debate of the 2016 campaign. Im Bret Baier, along with my comoderators Megyn Kelly and Chris Wallace. KELLY: Tonight, we are coming to you live from the Iowa Event Center in downtown Des Moines, in the shadow of the Iowa state capitol. In just four days, people here in the Hawkeye State will caucus and cast the first votes of the 2016 election.CHRIS WALLACE: Tonight, were partnering with Google for an exclusive second-screen experience. Search Fox News debate on Google any time in the next two hours to access exclusive content.You can see the campaigns respond to the debate in real time, and you can weigh in by voting on the topics being discussed. Just go to google.com or open your Google search app and type in Fox News debate.BAIER: Google sees political searches spike during televised presidential debates  no surprise there. But they spike by more than 440 percent on average, as voters across America seek to learn more about whats happening on the live debate stage.MEGYN KELLY: Seven candidates are on that stage tonight, their position on the stage determined by their standing in the latest national polls, as well as polls in Iowa and New Hampshire. And here they are.Texas Senator Ted Cruz.(APPLAUSE)Florida Senator Marco Rubio.(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Neurosurgeon Dr. Ben Carson.(APPLAUSE)Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush.(APPLAUSE)New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Ohio Governor John Kasich.(APPLAUSE) And Kentucky Senator Rand Paul.(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Apparently Iowas near Kentucky.BAIER: Tonights rules are simple. Up to 60 seconds for each answer, 30 seconds for each follow-up response. And if a candidate goes over the allotted time, you will hear this.(BELL RINGS)Double.KELLY: Wow.BAIER: I think the double is the one we want. Very pleasing.(LAUGHTER)We have a crowd of about 1,600 here, and while they have agreed to respect the candidates and listen intently, we can tell you they are very excited to be here. Am I right?(APPLAUSE)KELLY: So lets get started.Senator Cruz, before we get to the issues, lets address the elephant not in the room tonight.(LAUGHTER)Donald Trump has chosen not to attend this evenings presidential debate. What message do you think that sends to the voters of Iowa?CRUZ: Well, Megyn, let me say at the outset to the men and women of Iowa, thank you for the incredible hospitality over this past year.By Monday, you will have welcomed me into all 99 counties in Iowa. You will have welcomed my dad to preach at your churches. You will have welcomed Heidi and our girls, Caroline and Catherine, into your homes. And Im so grateful for the diligence, for the seriousness with which the men and women of Iowa approach this process.If I am elected president, keep an eye on the tarmac, because Ill be back, because Iowa in 2017 will not be fly-over country. It will be fly-to country.(APPLAUSE)Now, secondly, let me say Im a maniac and everyone on this stage is stupid, fat, and ugly. And Ben, youre a terrible surgeon.(LAUGHTER) Now that weve gotten the Donald Trump portion out of the way...(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)I want to thank everyone here for showing the men and women of Iowa the respect to show up and make the case to the people of this state and the people of the country why each of us believe we would make the best commander in chief.(APPLAUSE)KELLY: The divide between you and Mr. Trump has turned into one of the biggest stories in the country. And for six months that  your campaign, during this campaign, you praised Mr. Trump as somebody who you thought was an effective voice against the Washington cartel. You said you were glad that he was running as a Republican.But when he started to criticize you, your message changed, and you suddenly started to portray him as the voice of the Washington cartel, and suggested he would do the Democrats bidding. Which is it?CRUZ: Well, let me be clear, if Donald engages in insults or anybody else, I dont intend to reciprocate. I have not insulted Donald personally and I dont intend to.I am glad Donald is running. Im glad he has produced enormous enthusiasm, and, every Donald Trump voter or potential voter, I hope to earn your support. I know everyone else on this stage hopes to earn your support.Now, there is a difference between personal insults and attacks  between going into the mud with ad hominems and focusing on issues and substance. CRUZ: I think issues and substance, policy and vision and record should be the meat of politics. Thats fair game but thats where Im going to focus. Thats how I focused from the beginning of the campaign and it is how I intend to continue going forward.(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Senator Rubio, I want to explore this sort of larger issue. The campaign has in a sense turned into a battle for the soul of the Republican party: establishment versus grassroots, pragmatic versus principle. You say that you can unite all of the factions inside the GOP. How?RUBIO: Chris, lets begin by being clear what this campaign is about. Its not about Donald Trump. Hes an entertaining guy. Hes the greatest show on earth. This campaign is about the greatest country in the world and a president who has systematically destroyed many of the things that made America special.You see, we usually elect presidents in America that want to change the things that are wrong in America. Barack Obama wants to change America. Barack Obama wants America to be more like the rest of the world. We dont want to be like the rest of the world. We want to be the United States of America.(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: That is why Hillary Clinton cannot win this election. Hillary Clinton this week said Barack Obama would make a great Supreme Court justice. The guy who systematically and habitually violates the constitution on the Supreme Court? I dont think so. If Im our nominee, I will unite this party and well defeat Hillary Clinton and we will turn this country around once and for all, after seven years of the disaster that is Barack Obama.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Governor Bush, its hard for anyone of your pedigree to avoid being called establishment. But isnt that part of the problem in this race, that three others on this stage are splitting the main stream Republican vote and there by possibly handing this nomination over to an anti-establishment candidate?BUSH: Bret, were just starting. The first vote hasnt been counted. Why dont we let the process work. I trust Iowans, Granite staters (ph), people in South Carolina, people in Nevada, to start this process out. I kind of miss Donald Trump. He was a little teddy bear to me.(LAUGHTER)We always had such a loving relationship in these debates and in between and the tweets. I kind of miss him. I wish he was here. Everybody else was in the witness protection program when I went after him on behalf of what the Republican cause should be: conservative principles, believing in limited government, believing in accountability. Leading by fixing the things that are broken.Look, I am in the establishment because my dad, the greatest man alive was president of the United States and my brother, who I adore as well as fantastic brother was president. Fine, Ill take it. I guess Im part of the establishment Barbara Bush is my mom. Ill take that, too.(APPLAUSE)BUSH: But this election is not about our pedigree, this is an election about people that are really hurting. We need a leader that will fix things and have a proven record to do it. And we need someone who will take on Hillary Clinton in November. Someone who has a proven record, who has been tested, who is totally transparent. I released 34 years of tax returns...(BELL RINGS)... and 300,000 e-mails in my government record. To get the information from Hillary Clinton, you need to get a subpoena from the FBI.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Thank you governor.KELLY: Senator Christie, you began this campaign touting your record as a Republican from a blue state who knows how to get things done and reach across the aisle. However, many Republicans feel that reaching across the aisle and getting things done isnt great if you get the wrong things done. And they prefer to stand on principle rather than compromise. Why are they wrong and youre right?CHRISTIE: Theyre not wrong. But whats wrong is your premise in the question. You can do both. There is no reason why you cant stand for principles, go and fight for them and be able also, to have to get things done in government.You know, what people are frustrated about in Washington, D.C.., and I know the folks out there tonight are incredibly frustrated because what they see is a government that doesnt work for them. You know, for the 45-year-old construction worker out there, who is having a hard time making things meet.Hes lost $4,000 in the last seven years in his income because of this administration. He doesnt want to hear the talk about politics Megyn and who is establishment and who is grassroots. And whos compromised and who is principled. What he wants is something to get done.And thats the difference between being a governor and having done that for the last six years in New Jersey and being someone who has never had to be responsible for any of those decisions. Barack Obama was never responsible for those decisions.Hillary Clinton has never been responsible for those kind of decisions where they were held accountable. Ive been held accountable for six years as the governor of New Jersey and with a Democratic legislature, Ive gotten conservative things done. Thats exactly what Ill do as president of the United States.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Senator Paul, you are definitely not in the establishment category. But at the beginning of this campaign, you said you were your own man when asked about your father, former Texas Congressman and three-time presidential candidate Ron Paul.Senator Cruzs campaign is out with a video saying that Cruz is the intellectual and political heir to your fathers 2012 campaign and the liberty movement. And your father now says its realistic that Donald Trump will be your partys nominee.So did you make a mistake by not fully  more fully embracing your father politically at the beginning of this campaign?PAUL: You know, Ive always had a great deal of respect. Theres probably no person I respect more in the country or in recent history than my father. I think he was probably the most honest man in politics that weve ever seen in a generation.And so in no way have I ever said that I dont embrace my father or love my father or appreciate everything that he has done for the country. I think whats interesting about where that liberty vote goes that my father brought to the Republican Party is, I dont think theyre necessarily going to go for Ted.You know, Ted didnt show up. We had an audit-the-Fed vote, which was the biggest thing my dad had been advocating for, for 30 years, Ted didnt have time to show up. He was the only Republican that didnt show up for it.And so I think really that vote is going to stay in the Paul household. I think more of it is coming and its going to grow.The NSA is another big issue. Ted said he was for NSA reform, but then he told Marco Rubio, no, no, no, I voted for the bill because Im for the government collecting 100 percent of your cell phone records.I dont think Ted can have it both ways. They want to say theyre getting some of the liberty vote. But we dont see it happening at all. We think were going to do very well in Iowa with the liberty vote.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Senator Cruz, your response to that?CRUZ: Well, I agree with Rand that I very much respect Ron Paul and that I think anyone who is able to win in the Republican Party has to be able to bring together the disparate elements of the Reagan coalition. Youve got to be able to bring together conservatives and evangelicals and libertarians, and stitch together a winning majority.When it comes to the audit the Fed bill, as Rand knows well, I was an original sponsor of the bill, Im strongly supportive of it. It didnt have the votes to pass. And I had commitments to be at a town hall in New Hampshire.But I look forward to signing that bill into law as president and auditing the Fed and providing needed accountability at the Federal Reserve.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Senator Rubio?RUBIO: I think, you know, Rand and I have some significant issues on policy, but I respect Rand. He believes everything he stands for.(APPLAUSE)I do respect Rand.But I want to be frank about what I stand for. I believe the world is a safer and a better place when America is the strongest power in the world. And I believe only with a strong America will we defeat this radical group, this apocalyptic group called ISIS.Thats why when Im president we are going to rebuild our intelligence capabilities. And theyre going to tell us where the terrorists are. And a rebuilt U.S. military is going to destroy these terrorists.And if we capture any of these ISIS killers alive, they are going to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and were going to find out everything they know, because when Im president, unlike Barack Obama, we will keep this country safe.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Thank you, Senator.PAUL: May I respond?(CROSSTALK)BAIER: Well come back to...PAUL: Well, I mean, I was talked about in the question.BAIER: OK. Go ahead, go ahead. PAUL: Just very quickly, I would like to respond.The bulk collection of your phone data, the invasion of your privacy did not stop one terrorist attack. I dont think you have to give up your liberty for a false sense of security.When we look at this bulk collection, the court has looked at this. Even the court declared it to be illegal. If we want to collect the records of terrorists, lets do it the old fashioned way. Lets use the Fourth Amendment. Lets put a name on a warrant, lets ask a judge for it. Lets respect the history of our country.John Adams said that we fought a War for Independence because we wanted to fight against generalized warrants. Lets dont forget that.(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Governor Kasich, I want to get back to this question of where conservatives are this year. You call yourself a, quote, inside-outside guy, a reformer who knows how to get things done, but you reject the establishment label.First question is why do you reject it? And secondly, what do you say to Republican voters this year who view practical government experience as a liability and not an asset?KASICH: Well, first of all, I had a national reporter say, you know, theres three lanes. Theres the establishment lane, the anti- establishment lane, and then theres the Kasich lane.And the reason is, is that Ive been a reformer all of my career, fighting to reform welfare, fighting to reform the Pentagon, also being in a position to balance the budget, because that is very, very hard to do.And then in Ohio, of course, I had to bring about big reform, again, because we were so far in the hole and now we just found out we are up over 400,000 jobs since I took over as governor.KASICH: You know, the situation is this. We cannot fix things in this country  the Social Security, the border, balancing the budget, getting wages to grow faster  unless we lead as conservatives, but we also invite people in from the other party. We have to come together as a country. And we have to stop all the divisions.And, you know, thats been my message in New Hampshire. And having been in New Hampshire and here in Iowa, but in New Hampshire, I just received the support of seven out of eight of the newspapers in that state because they see positive, they see unity, they see coming together, and they see a record of change and a record of accomplishment.And it isnt because Im all that great. Its because Ive been assembling a team of people who want to be involved in something thats a little bigger than themselves. Ill keep  Ill keep heading in that direction, believe me.(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Dr. Carson, I want to pick up on that with you. Governor Kasich likes to say he knows how to land the plane. Youve landed a lot of planes in the O.R. But what about the idea of running for president with no experience in government at all?CARSON: Well, I will gladly confess that Im the only one on this stage with no political title. Youre not going to hear a lot of polished political speech from me, but you will hear the truth. And I dont think you have to be a politician to tell the truth. In fact, sometimes its not that way...(APPLAUSE)... and Ive had more two a.m. phone calls than everybody here put together, making life and death decisions, put together very complex teams to accomplish things that have never been done before. And we are in a situation right now in our country that we have never been in before. We need people who think out of the box and can solve problems; can utilize the resources around them; very smart people, to focus on the problem and solve the problem.The American people are terrified. Thats why we have this abnormal situation going on right now. We dont need more of the same solutions. We need different solutions to solve the problems and to save our nation. (APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Gentlemen, were now going to start to drill down into specific issues that are on voters minds. Im going to start with one of the biggest ones, which is foreign terror.According to Google, ISIS was by far the most searched foreign policy topic over the last year. Senator Cruz, you talk tough about fighting terrorism. You talk about carpet bombing into oblivion. You talk about seeing if the sand will glow at night. But critics say that your record does not match up to that. You opposed giving President Obama authority to enforce his red line in Syria. Three years in a row now, you have voted against the Defense Authorization Act.How do you square your rhetoric with your record, sir?CRUZ: Well, Chris, I will apologize to nobody for the vigorousness with which I will fight terrorism, go after ISIS, hunt them down wherever they are, and utterly and completely destroy ISIS.(APPLAUSE)You know, you claim it is tough talk to discuss carpet bombing. It is not tough talk. It is a different, fundamental military strategy than what weve seen from Barack Obama. Barack Obama right now, number one, over seven years, has dramatically degraded our military. You know, just two weeks ago was the 25th anniversary of the first Persian Gulf war. When that war began, we had 8,000 planes. Today, we have about 4,000. When that war began, we had 529 ships. Today, we have 272.You want to know what carpet bombing is? Its what we did in the first Persian Gulf war; 1,100 air attacks a day, saturation bombing that utterly destroyed the enemy. Right now, Barack Obama is launching between 15 and 30 air attacks a day. Hes not arming the Kurds. We need to define the enemy. We need to rebuild the military to defeat the enemy. And we need to be focused and lift the rules of engagement so were not sending our fighting men and women into combat with their arms tied behind their backs.(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Senator Rubio, does Senator Cruzs record match his rhetoric?RUBIO: Well, again, I mean, obviously, as already has been pointed out, the only budget that Ted has ever voted for is a budget that Rand Paul sponsored that brags about cutting defense spending. And I think thats a bad idea for the following reason.ISIS is the most dangerous jihadist group in the history of mankind. ISIS is now found in affiliates in over a dozen countries. ISIS is a group that burns people alive in cages; that sells off little girls as brides. ISIS is a group that wants to trigger an apocalyptic showdown in the city of Dabiq  not the city of Dubuque; I mis-said  mis-said that wrong once (inaudible) time  the city of Dabiq in Syria. They want to trigger an apocalyptic Armageddon showdown.RUBIO: This group needs to be confronted and defeated. They are not going to go away on their own. Theyre not going to turn into stockbrokers overnight or open up a chain of car washes. They need to be defeated militarily, and that will take overwhelming U.S. force.Today, we are on pace to have the smallest Army since the end of World War II, the smallest Navy in 100 years, the smallest Air Force in our history. You cannot destroy ISIS with a military thats being diminished. When Im president, we are rebuilding the U.S. military because the world is a safer and a better place when America is the strongest military in the world.(CROSSTALK)WALLACE: Senator Cruz, youve got 30 seconds. You were mentioned.(APPLAUSE)CRUZ: Chris, in 1981, when Ronald Reagan came to the Oval Office, he encountered a military that had been debilitated just as the current military has, just like Jimmy Carter weakened our readiness, undermined our ability to defend this country, so too has Barack Obama. Just as morale in the military has plummeted in the last seven, so it had then.What Reagan did is he began with tax reform and regulatory reform, unleashing the engine of the American free enterprise system. It brought booming economic growth and that growth fueled rebuilding the military. I intend to do the exact same thing to defeat radical Islamic terrorism WALLACE: Gentlemen.CRUZ: ... and to devote the resources from the booming economy to rebuilding our Navy, rebuilding our Air Force, rebuilding our Army and ensuring we have the capacity to keep this country safe.PAUL: My budget was mentioned. My budget was mentioned.WALLACE: May I  may I just say, we are going to continue the questions about foreign terror, gentlemen, right after this break.KELLY: But first, you can join tonights conversation right from home. Go to google.com or open your Google search app and search Fox News debate to vote on which candidate you think has the best plan to defeat ISIS. Well be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER: Welcome back. Lets get right back to the questions. Chris.WALLACE: Thank you. Governor Christie, you have compared both Senators Cruz and Rubio to Barack Obama, saying that we cannot afford another inexperienced President. Youve also said that Senator Cruzs vote to curtail the NSA surveillance program made America less safe. Is either of them ready to be Commander in Chief?CHRISTIE: Well, let me say that I do believe that the vote on NSA made the country less safe. Well, let me tell you what the country should really be worried about. I watched that town hall meeting with the Democrats the other night, and I heard Hillary Clinton asked a direct question by an Iowan, and thats what Iowans like to do. They like to ask direct questions.And, they asked about her email situation. And, heres what she said to the American people. She did it for convenience. For her convenience. She put Americas secrets at risk for her convenience. She put American intelligence officers at risk for her convenience. She put American strategy at risk for her convenience.Let me tell you whos not qualified to be President of the United States, Chris. Hillary Rodham Clinton did that to our country. She is not qualified to be President of the United States.(CHEERING)The fact is what we need is someone on that stage who has been tested, who has been through it, who has made decisions, who has sit (ph) in the chair of consequence and can prosecute the case against Hillary Clinton on...(BELL RINGING)CHRISTIE: ... that stage, and that is exactly what I am ready to do.(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Governor Bush...CRUZ: Chris? Chris I was mentioned in that question.BUSH: No, you werent. Your name wasnt mentioned, Ted.CRUZ: ... Actually, I was...BUSH: ... Chris, keep it coming...WALLACE: ... I dont think that your name was mentioned...CRUZ: ... Chris, your questions that you...WALLACE: ... Sir, I think  I think the question was...CRUZ: ... What was your question...WALLACE: ... Its not my question that you get a chance to respond to, its his answer.(LAUGHTER)WALLACE: You dont get 30 seconds to respond to me...CRUZ: ... Your question was you have disagreed...(AUDIENCE REACTION)WALLACE: ... You dont get 30 seconds to respond to me...CRUZ: ... (inaudible) opening statement.WALLACE: ... If I could go on. Sir, I know you like to argue about the rules, but were going to conduct a debate...BUSH: ... Thank you Chris...WALLACE: ... Governor Bush...CRUZ: ... This entire question was an attack, but thats (inaudible)WALLACE: Governor Bush, heres the question  Im going to ask Governor Bush the question.You criticized several candidates in this field on this stage for what you call unrealistic ideas about how to fight terrorists, including Rubio, and Cruz on the issue of their refusing to give the President authority to enforce the redline in Syria.But, given the fact that your brother got us into two wars in Iraq and Afghanistan that have still not ended.That have still not ended, what lessons have you learned from his mistakes, sir?BUSH: Well, first, I was critical of the Senators not giving the authorization for the use of military force. They should have made it more open ended for the next president. We shouldnt have the war fighters have their arms tied behind their back as President Obama wanted to do, but they had a chance to show support and it wasnt popular at the time. It became popular after the attack in Paris, and San Bernardino. Now we hear the tough talk.Prior to that, in the Reagan Library, I gave a detailed plan. Exactly what to do as it relates to ISIS. And it is from the lessons from history that we do this because if we allow this to fester, were going to have Islamic terrorism, multi-generations of it all across this country. The caliphate of ISIS has to be destroyed, which means we need to arm directly to Kurds, imbed our troops with the Iraqi military, re engage with the Sunni tribal leaders. Get the lawyers off the damn backs of the military once and for all.(CHEERING)BUSH: Have a no fly zone in Syria and create safe zones to deal with the refugees. But, more importantly, to train a Sunni-led force in Syria to take out ISIS with our support...(BELL RINGING)BUSH: ... ground and air. Thats what we need to to, and I laid that out prior to the crisis with the advice of a lot of people, including 12 Medal of Honor recipients that Im proud that theyre supporting my campaign.(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Senator Cruz, now you get a chance to respond.CRUZ: Chris, I would note that that the last four questions have been, Rand, please attack Ted. Marco, please attack Ted. Chris, please attack Ted. Jeb, please attack Ted...(AUDIENCE)CRUZ: Let me just say this...WALLACE: ... It is a debate, sir.CRUZ: ... Well, no, no. A debate actually is a policy issue, but I will say this. Gosh, if you guys ask one more mean question I may have to leave the stage.(APPLAUSE)CRUZ: Chris, the most important determination any voter is going to make in this election is whos best prepared to be Commander in Chief. Who has the experience, who has the knowledge, who has the judgement, who has the clarity, and vision and strength of resolve to keep this country safe. That is what this debate is all about, and I would suggest lets stay focused on those issues  rather than just attacks directed at each other.WALLACE: I think the questions were about issues. Senator Rubio, what would you like to respond sir...(APPLAUSE)(CROSSTALK)PAUL: ... Senator Cruz, Id like to respond...RUBIO: ... First of all  Let me go first, and then you can please recognize Rand after.(LAUGHTER)RUBIO: First of all...PAUL: ... and Id like to respond.RUBIO: ... do I go  let me go first, and then you can please recognize Rand after. But...(LAUGHTER)... first of all...WALLACE: Thank you.PAUL: Thank you, Marco.RUBIO: ... first of all, Im  dont worry, Im not leaving the stage no matter what you ask me.WALLACE: Good.RUBIO: And second of all...(APPLAUSE)... and I think  you know, Governor  Jeb, you  the attack that  the authorization that Barack Obama asked for was not against ISIS. It was against Assad. And John Kerry described it as attacks that would be unbelievably small.I dont think the United States should be engaged in symbolic military activity. So it was not against ISIS, it was against  it was against Assad.I think the United States military is operating under rules of engagement that are too strict...(BELL RINGS)...and that do not allow us to pursue victory. When Im president, that will change.(CROSSTALK)WALLACE: Senator Paul, go ahead. PAUL: Thank you.The issue in Syrias a very important one, and its one we need to get right. The question is, should we be bombing both sides of the war? Some want (ph) to topple Assad. In fact, they want to bomb ISIS and Assad simultaneously.I think thats a really, really bad idea. In fact, Ive said for several years that arming the allies of ISIS will make the situation worse, That what we really need to do is defeat ISIS.But if you defeat Assad, what you will wind up with is a larger and more powerful ISIS that occupies that space. You might  you may well see an ISIS that takes over all of Syria.(BELL RINGS)KASICH: Chris...(APPLAUSE)... there was a question about foreign policy, by the way, and experience. And I  I thought, if I didnt jump in, I might not be able to tell everybody this. I think theyd want to hear it.Look, I served on...WALLACE: Well...(CROSSTALK)WALLACE: ... well be talking about foreign policy a little bit later. Were going to talk...KELLY: We have a lot  we have a lot to cover. But we want to  we want to turn the page to domestic...(CROSSTALK)KASICH: ... but wait a minute...KELLY: No, no. No.KASICH: ...the only reason is  look...KELLY: No no no, because we want to turn the page to domestic terror, and let me tell you why: were partnering with Google on this debate, and theyre telling us...KASICH: OK.KELLY: ... that their search results have gone through the roof on  on people...KASICH: Ive always listened to you, Megyn. Go ahead.KELLY: ... youre a good man, Governor Kasich.KASICH: Yes  thank you.KELLY: People  the search results  the searches for terror issues, for safety issues in America have gone through the roof, increased over 400 percent since 2008.People are worried. Theyre worried about whats happening in the country and about a domestic terror attack, as all of you know. Now, when combating this threat, Senator Rubio, youve advocated closing down mosques  well get back to you.Well, you have advocated closing down  closing down mosques, diners, any place where radicalization is occurring. You told me that. But the Supreme Court has made clear that hateful speech is generally protected by the First Amendment.In other words, radical Muslims have the right to be radical Muslims, unless they turn to terror. Doesnt your position run afoul of the First Amendment?RUBIO: Megyn, thats the problem. Radical Muslims and radical Islam is not just hate talk. Its hate action. They blow people up. Look what they did in San Bernardino.Look at the attack they inspired in Philadelphia, that the White House still refuses to link to terror, where a guy basically shot a police officer three times.He told the police, I did it because I was inspired by ISIS, and to this day, the White House still refuses to acknowledge it had anything to do with terror.Look, the threat we face from ISIS is unprecedented. There has never been a jihadist group like this. They have affili",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tes in over a dozen countries now.They are the best funded radical jihadist group in the history of the world, and they have shown a sophisticated understanding of the laws of other countries on how to insert fighters into places, and they are actively plotting to attack us here at home and around the world.We must keep America safe from this threat. And yes, when I am president of the United States, if there is some place in this country where radical jihadists are planning to attack the United States, we will go after them wherever they are, and if we capture them alive, they are going to Guantanamo.(APPLAUSE)PAUL: (inaudible).KELLY: Senator Paul, do you agree with that? Were gonna close down mosques, were gonna close down diners where we think radical thinkings (ph) occurring? (CROSSTALK)PAUL: Yeah (ph), no, I think thats a  thats a huge mistake, to be closing down mosques. But I would say that if you want to defend the country, it begins with border security. And this is where Ive had my disagreement with Senator Rubio.When he brought forward the Gang of Eight bill to give citizenship to those who came here illegally, I put forward an amendment that says we should have more scrutiny on those who are coming as students, those who are coming as immigrants, those who are coming as refugees, because we had two refugees come to my town in Bowling Green and try to attack us.Marco opposed this because they made a deal. He made a deal with Chuck Schumer that he would oppose any conservative amendments. And I think thats a mistake, and I just dont think Marco can have it both ways. You cant be in favor of defend us...(BELL RINGS)... against Islam  radical Islam  if youre not for border security.RUBIO: Might I respond?(APPLAUSE)The first thing  I dont know of anyone whos not in favor of fully vetting people that are trying to come into this country, other than perhaps Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. I think we all support that. Rands amendment was not the right way to do it.I do believe that people who are trying to come to the United States  this country has a right to know who they are and why they are coming. And thats why Ive been clear, when I am the president of the United States of America, we dont know who you are, and we dont know why youre trying to come to the United States, you are not going to get in, because the radical threat that we now face from ISIS is extraordinary and unprecedented...(BELL RINGS)... and when Im president, we are keeping ISIS out of America.KELLY: Governor Christie, lets talk about profiling.(APPLAUSE)In December...CHRISTIE: Talk about what? I...KELLY: ... profiling. Profiling. In December, two radical Muslims killed 14 people in San Bernardino, California. Neighbors of the terrorists said that they did not report the couple to law enforcement prior to the crime, because they were afraid that they would be accused of profiling.Now, you have said that we should not profile. How do you square that with the San Bernardino case?CHRISTIE: Well, because you can do it without profiling, Megyn, when you do it on the facts. What those facts knew was that these folks had weapons. They knew that they were talking about trying to take our country and attack it.Thats not profiling, thats law enforcement. And thats the difference between somebody who knows how to do this and somebody whos never done it before.KELLY: They didnt know they were going to attack the country.CHRISTIE: They knew they were talking about the issues of attacking people, Megyn. They knew that.(CROSSTALK)KELLY: Thats not true. The neighbors said they saw men going in and out of the garage. They saw packages being delivered. They saw Muslims, and they did not think that was enough to call the cops. Do you?CHRISTIE: Listen, I think that what people should do is use their common sense. And the fact is, let law enforcement make those decisions. Ive told people that from the time I was U.S. attorney 13 years ago.Its not for them to make those decisions about whether or not something is legal or illegal, or profiling or not. You see something thats suspicious, you call law enforcement and let law enforcement make those decisions.Thats what should be done. That can be done. That can be done without profiling people. What that is, is just common sense. They thought something was wrong.And heres the problem in this country right now. The problem is that Barack Obama has made law enforcement the enemy, Hillary Clinton has made law enforcement the enemy.Theyre not supporting our law enforcement officers, its making everybody nervous to get out of their cars, if youre a law enforcement officer. Its making... (BELL RINGS)CHRISTIE: ... everybody nervous to get out of their cars if youre a law enforcement officer.(BELL RINGS)Its making people in neighborhoods nervous to go to law enforcement. As president, I will support law enforcement and well stop radical terrorist attacks in this country by supporting our intelligence community and law enforcement community.(APPLAUSE)KELLY: Dr. Carson, this week a female Muslim who served in the U.S. Air Force asked Hillary Clinton the question, she asked whether the United States is still the best place in which to raise her three Muslim children. Given what she perceives as a rise in Islamaphobia in this country. Do you think the GOP messaging on Muslims has stoked the flames of bias on this as the Democrats suggest, and how would you answer this veteran?CARSON: Well, I dont know about the GOP messaging, but I can tell you about my messaging. You know, need to stop allowing political correctness to dictate our policies, because its going to kill us if we dont.(APPLAUSE)CARSON: And in the Holy Land Foundation trial in 2006 in Texas, they had a memorandum, an explanatory memorandum that talked about the fact that Americans would be easy to overcome and to commit civilization jihad because they were going to be trying to protect the rights of the very people who were trying to subvert them.But I believe in the Teddy Roosevelt philosophy. Teddy Roosevelt said, we are a nation of immigrants. As such, everybody is welcome from any race, any country, any religion, if they want to be Americans. If they want to accept our values and our laws. If not, they can stay where they are.(APPLAUSE)KELLY: Governor Kasich, stand back. You appear to back in another debate, a so-called back door to encrypted cell phone technology, which protects most smartphones that we all have from hacking. And it includes our phones and it also protects the cell phones of the terrorist.Now the tech companies and a group of MIT scientists, smart guys, right, warn that if they create a way for the FBI to have a back door into our encrypted communications, then the bad guys will exploit it too. And they say that this is going to cause more security problems than it would solve for everyday Americans. Are they wrong?KASICH: Well, look the Joint Terrorism Task Force needs resources and tools. And those are made up of the FBI, state and local law enforcement. And Megyn, its best not to talk anymore about back doors and encryption, it will get solved, but it needs to be solved in the situation of the White House with the technology folks.MEGYN: But this is public testimony.KASICH: But I just have to tell you that its best with some of these things not be said. Now I want to go back something. See, I was there when Reagan rebuilt the military. I was there in 89 when the wall came tumbling down because we were strong.And I was there when we went into the Gulf War. We didnt win that war just from the air, we won that war by assembling a group of Arab leaders who stood in the Rose Garden and stood with America. We want to destroy ISIS, it has to be in the air and on the ground. It has to be with our friends in the Arab world and our friends in Europe, the coalition that we had when we went to the first Gulf War.And then when we win that, and we will win that against ISIS as it settles down, and we should leave. Because we shouldnt be policemen of the world. But what we need to do is turn it over to the regional powers to be able to handle that.KASICH: But we have a unique time in America to connect with people all around the world that understand that theres an existential threat against all of them, the Arabs, the Jordanians, the Saudis, the Egyptians, our friends in Europe, including the Turks. So we have a unique opportunity to bring everybody together.I saw Reagan do it, Ive seen other presidents do it. And frankly, if you want to be commander in chief, you have to have the experience. At the same time were doing all that, the Pentagon must be reformed so we get what we need for our men and women in uniform. All of that together, were going to be just fine and America is going to continue to lead the world.KELLY: Governor, thank you.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Governor Bush, just today, a wounded warrior organization designed to help wounded veterans and their families is coming under fire for raising tens of millions of dollars, but spending almost half of that on travel and hotels and dinners and luxury, lavish conferences. So taking care of veterans is obviously a huge issue in the country that has asked so many to serve and sacrifice so much.If you were president. would you police these charity organizations that say theyre helping vets?BUSH: Of course. And theres all sorts of ways that can be done at the state, local and federal level to do that. But the first duty of the next president of the United States is to fix the mess at the Department of Veterans Affairs. Thats his first responsibility.(APPLAUSE)Look, we have waiting lists for veterans that are  that are leaving because of the sequester where were gutting the military. More and more military personnel are leaving becoming veterans, and the waiting list grows. Theyve given out $140 million of bonuses to Veterans Department employees, including reducing the waiting lists, without giving veterans care. People died, and only three people have been fired.I will make sure that we fire the sheer incompetence inside the Department of Veterans Affairs and then well give veterans a choice card so that they dont have to travel hours and hours to get care if they want to go to their private provider. You want to make the Veterans Administration do a better job, give them  give veterans choices and youll get a much better result. And as it relates to all the other organizations, let me give you a good example.In Houston, Texas, theres an organization in place because someone acted on their heart, wanted to make sure that theres no homeless veterans in Houston. And theyve come pretty close to that without federal government assistance. We need to mobilize the entire country to treat our veterans and treat them with much more respect than they get today.BAIER: Governor Bush, thank you.(APPLAUSE)Speaking of veterans, we have a question from a veteran who is one of the top Youtube creators. Over the course of the evening, gentlemen, we will hear from some of Youtubes most followed stars. And heres one of them.QUESTION: Im Mark Watson. Im known for my (inaudible) views on Youtube, but Im also a veteran who served in the Army for eight years.As an African-American living near Ferguson, Ive seen the strain between police officers and the communities they serve firsthand. Now, there are great tools like body cameras that  to protect both officers and citizens, but we all currently have better cameras in our pockets than in our precincts. Why arent we using the technology available to better protect our communities?BAIER: Senator Paul, that question to you.PAUL: You know, Ive supported legislation to allow body cameras. Ive been to Ferguson, Ive been trying to look for solutions to our criminal justice problem.One thing I discovered in Ferguson was that a third of the budget for the city of Ferguson was being reaped by civil fines. People were just being fined to death. Now you and I and many of the people in this audience, if we get a $100 fine, we can survive it. If youre living on the edge of poverty and you get a $100 fine or your car towed, a lot of times you lose your job.I also think the war on drugs has disproportionately affected our African-American community, and what we need to do is make sure that the war on drugs is equal protection under the law and that we dont unfairly incarcerate another generation of young African-American males.In Ferguson, for every 100 African-American women, there are only 60 African-American men. Drug use is about equal between white and black, but our prisons  three out of four people in prison are black or brown. I think something has to change. I think its a big thing that our party needs to be part of, and Ive been a leader in Congress on trying to bring about criminal justice reform.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Senator Paul, thank you.WALLACE: This debate is just getting started.

Everybody always said they want to cut federal spending and usually they start by saying theyll cut waste, fraud, and abuse, but that really doesnt ever materialize. We all know that.Governor Christie, you talk a lot about entitlement reform and you say that thats where the federal government can get savings needed to balance the budget. But can you name even one thing that the federal government does now that it should not do at all?CHRISTIE: Yes. You want one?(LAUGHTER)BAIER: I want one. Yes.(LAUGHTER)CHRISTIE: How about one that Ive done in New Jersey for the last six years. Thats get rid of Planned Parenthood funding from the United States of America.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Anything bigger than that?CHRISTIE: Bigger than that? Let me tell you something, when you see thousands upon thousands upon thousands of children being murdered in the womb, I cant think of anything better than that.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: And, Governor, I realize everyone on this stage opposes Obamacare and youre not alone. Google Data shows that in the last month when people searched policy repeals, that there were a lot of them. Obamacare took the top two spots. But today there are millions of people who gained health insurance from Obamacare and they now rely on it.So the question, Senator Cruz, if you repeal Obamacare, as you say you will, will you be fine if millions of those people dont have health insurance? And what is your specific plan for covering the uninsured?CRUZ: Sure. Well, lets take it one at a time. First of all, we have seen now in six years of Obamacare that it has been a disaster. It is the biggest job-killer in this country. Millions of Americans have lost their jobs, have been forced into part-time work, have lost their health insurance, have lost their doctors, have seen their premiums skyrocket.If Im elected president, we will repeal every word of Obamacare. (APPLAUSE)CRUZ: Now, once that is done, everyone agrees we need healthcare reform. It should follow the principles of expanding competition, empowering patients, and keeping government from getting in between us and our doctors.Three specific reforms that reflect those principles. Number one, we should allow people to purchase health insurance across state lines. That will create a true 50-state national marketplace which will drive down the cost of low-cost, catastrophic health insurance.Number two, we should expand health savings accounts so people can save in a tax-advantaged way for more routine healthcare needs. And number three, we should work to de-link health insurance from employment so if you lose your job, your health insurance goes with you and it is personal, portable and affordable.And Ill tell you, Bret, I think thats a much more attractive vision for healthcare than the Washington-drive, top-down Obamacare that is causing so many millions of people to hurt.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Senator Cruz, thank you.Governor Bush, youve advocated for statehood for Puerto Rico. The Puerto Rican economy is collapsing under unsustainable debt burden. Only about 1 million of its 4 million residents are currently employed. So should American citizens who you say are already overtaxed, bail out Puerto Rico as well?BUSH: No, they shouldnt. And I believe that Puerto Rico ought to have the right of self-determination. If I was a Puerto Rican, Id vote for statehood so that they have full citizenship. They serve in the military. They would have to pay federal taxes. They would  they would accept the responsibilities of full U.S. citizenship. But they should have the right of determine  self-determination.Before you get to that, though, Puerto Rico is going to have to deal with the structural problems they face. You know, its  its a fact that if you can pay for a $79 one-way ticket to Orlando, and you can escape the challenges of a declining economy and high crime rates, you move to Orlando.And a lot of people are doing that. And the spiraling out-of- control requires Puerto Rico to make structural reforms. The federal government can play a role in allowing them to do that, but they should not  the process of statehood or the status of Puerto Rico wont be solved until we get to the bigger issue of how you deal with the structural economic problems theyre facing right now.BAIER: Governor Kasich, youre one of two remaining sitting governors still in the race. Your colleague, Governor Rick Snyder of Michigan is under fire  he and his administration  for the Flint, Michigan water crisis and the botched response to it. How would you have handled that?KASICH: Well, youve got to be on top of it right away. And, you know, I dont know all the details of what Rick Snyder has done. I know there have been people who have been fired; people who are being held accountable. But the fact is, every single engine of government has to move when you see a crisis like that.And Ive had many situations in the state of Ohio where weve had to move, whether its storms, whether it was a horrible school shooting. There are many crises that come  a water crisis in Toledo. Youve got to be on top of it. Youve got to go the extra mile. Youve got to work with local communities and youve got to work with the federal government.Because you realize that people depending on you. And so, you go the extra mile. But people have to be alert. They have to be alert to problems. And when you see a problem, you must act quickly to get on top of it. And people at home are saying theyve got a problem, listen to them. Because most of the time, theyre absolutely correct.So the fact is that we work for the people. The people dont work for us. And we have to have an attitude when were in government of serving-hood. Thats what really matters. We serve you. You dont serve us. We listen to you and  and then we act.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Senator Rubio, on the issue of climate change, in 2008, you wanted Florida to get ahead of other states and establish a cap- and-trade system, a program for carbon emissions, which many Republicans thought at the time would hurt the Florida economy. Now, youre a skeptic of climate change science. And in fact, you warn that federal efforts to fight climate change will cost U.S. jobs and hurt the U.S. economy.So why the change?RUBIO: Well, Bret, first thats not entirely the story. At the time, the liberal governor of Florida, who claimed he was a Republican  his name was Charlie Crist  he wanted to impose cap-and-trade on Florida. And I opposed it. I was the first person out of the box that opposed him on it.And then we saw that the leading candidates for president at the time, both the Republican and the Democrats, all supported it. And what we said is, if theyre going to impose this on us, we better prepare to protect the state from it. But I have never supported cap- and-trade and I never thought it was a good idea. And I was clear about that at the time.And I do not believe its a good idea now. I do not believe that we have to destroy our economy in order to protect our environment. And especially what these programs are asking us to pass that will do nothing to help the environment, but will be devastating for our economy.When I am president of the United States of America, there will never be any cap-and-trade in the United States.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Thanks, Senator.KELLY: All right. Were going to move on. Because coming up, immigration, and something youve never seen before.Stay tuned, right after this break.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Welcome back everyone. Live, in Des Moines, Iowa. Now, we move onto the topic of immigration. Senator Rubio, well start with you. When you ran for Senate in 2010, you made clear that you opposed legalization and citizenship for illegal immigrants. You promised repeatedly that you would oppose it as a U.S. Senator as well. Here are just a few examples. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RUBIO: Never support. Never have and never will support any effort to grant blanket legalization amnesty to folks who have entered, or stayed in this country illegally.(END VIDEO CLIP)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RUBIO: First of all, earned path to citizenship is basically code for amnesty. Its what they call it. And, the reality of it is this, it is unfair to the people that have legally entered this country to create an alternative for individuals who entered illegally, and knowingly did so.(END VIDEO CLIP)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RUBIO: You cannot grant amnesty. If the American people see us granting amnesty they will never again believe in legal immigration. They will never again support it, and thats wrong for our country, bad for our future.(END VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Within two years of getting elected you were co-sponsoring legislation to create a path to citizenship, in your words, amnesty. Havent you already proven that you cannot be trusted on this issue?RUBIO: No, because if you look at the quote, and its very specific. And, it says blanket amnesty, I do not support blanket amnesty...KELLY: ... But, you went on from there...RUBIO: ... I do not support amnesty...KELLY: ... You said more than that, Senator...RUBIO: ... No, I said I do not support blanket amnesty...KELLY: ... You said earned path to citizenship is basically code for amnesty. You...RUBIO: ... It was...KELLY: ... supported earned path to citizenship...RUBIO: ... It absolutely has been, and at the time in the context of that was in 2009, and 2010, where the last effort for legalization was an effort done in the Senate. It was an effort led by several people that provided almost an instant path with very little obstacles moving forward.What Ive always said is that this issue does need to be solved. Theyve been talking about this issue for 30 years, and nothing ever happens. And, Im going to tell you exactly how were going to deal with it when I am president.Number one, were going to keep ISIS out of America. If we dont know who you are, or why youre coming, you will not get into the United States.RUBIO: Number two, were going to enforce our immigration laws. I am the son and grandson of immigrants. And I know that securing our borders is not anti-immigrant and we will do it.Well hire 20,000 new border agents instead of 20,000 new IRS agents. We will finish the 700 miles of fencing and walls our nation needs. Well have mandatory E-verify, a mandatory entry/exit tracking system and until all of that is in place and all of that is working and we can prove to the people of this country that illegal immigration is under control, nothing else is going to happen.We are not going to round up and deport 12 million people, but were not going to hand out citizenship cards, either. There will be a process. We will see what the American people are willing to support. But it will not be unconstitutional executive orders like the ones Barack Obama has forced on us.KELLY: Governor Bush, do you agree Senator Rubio has not reversed himself on his immigration promise?BUSH: Well, Im kind of confused because he was the sponsor of the Gang of Eight bill that did require a bunch of thresholds but ultimately allowed for citizenship over an extended period of time. I mean, thats a fact. And he asked me to support that. And I  I supported him because I think people, when youre elected, you need to do things.And he led the charge to finally fix this immigration problem that has existed now for, as Marco says, for 30 years. And then he cut and run because it wasnt popular amongst conservatives, I guess.Heres what I believe. And I wrote a book about this called Immigration Wars. You can get it at $2.99 on Amazon. Its not a bestseller. I can promise you.(LAUGHTER)There wont be any  you can get it. Its affordable for everybody. We should have a path to legal status for the 12 million people that are here illegally. It means, come out from the shadows, pay a fine, earn legal status by working, by paying taxes, learning English. Not committing crimes and earn legal status where youre not cutting in front of the line for people that are patiently waiting outside.(APPLAUSE) I think that is the  I think thats the conservative consensus pragmatic approach to how to solve this problem.RUBIO: May I respond?KELLY: Go ahead, senator.RUBIO: Its interesting that Jeb mentions the book. Thats the book where you changed your position on immigration because you used to support a path to citizenship.BUSH: So did you.(LAUGHTER)RUBIO: Well, but you changed the  in the book...BUSH: Yeah. So did you, Marco.(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: You wrote a book where you changed your position from a path of citizenship to a path of legalization. And the bottom line is this, we are not going to be able to do anything on this issue until we first bring illegal immigration under control. The American people have been told for 30 years theyre going to enforce the border, theyre going to build a wall and it never gets built and it never happens.It is very clear there will be no progress on this issue in any way, shape or form, until you prove to the people of this country that illegal immigration is under control. And when Im president, we are going to bring it under control once and for all after 30 years of talking about it.BUSH: Marco, Marco  he brought up my name. I have supported a consensus approach to solving this problem wherever it came up. and in 2007 it almost passed when my brother was president of the United States. A bipartisan approach got close. Barack Obama actually had the poison pill to stop it then.And when you led the charge with the Gang of Eight, I supported it because you asked me to. I think its important for people in elected office to try to forge consensus to solve problems. Theres never going do be perfect bill.(APPLAUSE)KELLY: All right.BUSH: But when you didnt do that and you ask people to support, you shouldnt cut and run.RUBIO: But Megyn...BUSH: You should stick with it and thats exactly what happened. He cut and run. And thats a tragedy because now...(BELL RINGS)... its harder and harder to actually solve this problem.KELLY: All right. This will be the last one.RUBIO: Theres not going to be consensus on this issue until we enforce our immigration laws. That is abundantly clear. Youre not going to be able to ram down the throat of the American people your approach. The only way were are going to be able to move forward after two migratory crises with minor, after two unconstitutional executive orders, the only way forward on this issue is to first bring illegal immigration under control. And until that happens theres not going to be consensus on this issue.KELLY: OK. Lets move on. Senator Cruz, when Senator Rubio proposed that bill creating a path to citizenship, you proposed an amendment. It would have allowed for legalization but not citizenship. Yes, it would.Pressed last month on why you supported legalization, you claimed that you didnt. Right? Like you just did. Saw that.(LAUGHTER)You argued that this was just a poison pill amendment, basically its something designed to kill the bill and not actually get it through. But that is not, however, how it sounded at the time. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CRUZ: I want this bill to be voted down. I dont want immigration reform to fail. I want immigration reform to pass. I believe if this amendment were to pass, the chances of this bill passing into law would increase dramatically.I believe if the amendments I introduced were adopted, that the bill would pass. And my effort in introducing them was to find a solution that reflected common ground and that fixed the problem.CRUZ: If the proponents of this bill actually demonstrate a commitment not to politics, not to campaigning all the time, but to actually fixing this problem, to finding a middle ground. That would fix the problem, and also allow, for those 11 million people who are here illegally, a legal status, with citizenship off the table.KELLY: Was that all an act? It was pretty convincing.CRUZ: You know, the amendment youre talking about is one sentence  its 38 words. Anyone can go online at tedcruz.org and read exactly what it said. In those 38 words, it said anyone here illegally is permanently ineligible for citizenship. It didnt say a word about legalization. I introduced...KELLY: But the bill allowed both. The bill you were amending allowed citizenship and legalization.CRUZ: But  but Megyn, the bill was 1,000 pages. I introduced a series of amendments, each designed to fix problems in the bill. The fact that each amendment didnt fix every problem didnt mean that I supported the rest of the bill.And Ill tell you who supported my amendment  Jeff Sessions, the strongest opponent of amnesty in the United States Congress. And he did so because taking citizenship off the table was important, and it revealed the hypocrisy of the proponents of this bill, who were looking for votes.Listen, we can solve immigration. We just heard an argument back and forth that we cant solve immigration. I have a detailed immigration plan that is on my website, tedcruz.org. It was designed with Iowas own Congressman Steve King and Jeff Sessions, and...(APPLAUSE)... we have the tools in federal law to do this now. We can build the fence. We can triple the border patrol. We can end sanctuary cities by cutting off...(BELL RINGS)... funding to them. We can end welfare for those here illegally. And what is missing is the political will, because too many Democrats and, sadly, too many Republicans dont want to solve this problem. If I am elected president...(BELL RINGS)... we will secure the border...KELLY: OK, sir.CRUZ: ... and we will end the illegal immigration.KELLY: Senator Paul.(APPLAUSE)You know how Washington works. Do you buy that?PAUL: I was there and I saw the debate. I saw Ted Cruz say, well take citizenship off the table, and then the bill will pass, and Im for the bill.The bill would involve legalization. He cant have it both ways. But what is particularly insulting, though, is that he is the king of saying, youre for amnesty. Everybodys for amnesty except for Ted Cruz.But its a falseness, and thats an authenticity problem  that everybody he knows is not as perfect as him because were all for amnesty. I was for legalization. I think, frankly, if you have border security, you can have legalization. So was Ted, but now he says it wasnt so. Thats not true.KELLY: Go ahead, sir.(APPLAUSE)CRUZ: You know, John Adams famously said, facts are are stubborn things. The facts are are very, very simple. When that battle was waged, my friend Senator Rubio chose to stand with Barack Obama and Harry Reid and Chuck Schumer and support amnesty.And I stood alongside Jeff Sessions and Steve King, and we led the fight against amnesty. And if you want to know whos telling the truth, you should look and ask people like Jeff Sessions and Steve King and Rush Limbaugh and Mark Levin, all of whom say, as Jeff Sessions said, responding to these false attacks just recently in Alabama  he said, if it wasnt for Ted Cruz, the Gang of Eight Rubio/Schumer bill would have passed. But because Ted stood up and helped lead the effort, millions rose up to kill it.(BELL RINGS)(APPLAUSE)KELLY: Senator Rubio, even Chuck Schumer, your co-sponsor of that bill...RUBIO: Yeah, but let me respond...KELLY: ... agrees with Ted Cruz on this. RUBIO: ... no, I understand, but let me respond. I (ph) was mentioned on this  in this answer, and so Im going to respond this way.This is the lie that Teds campaign is built on, and Rand touched upon it  that hes the most conservative guy, and everyone else is a  you know, everyone else is a rhino.The truth is, Ted, throughout this campaign, youve been willing to say or do anything in order to get votes. Ted, you worked for George W. Bushs campaign...(BOOING)You  you  you helped design George W. Bushs  you helped design George W. Bushs immigration policy. And then, when you got to the Senate, you did an interview with CBS News  I (ph) wasnt even part of the video  where you said, on the issue of people that are here illegally, we can reach a compromise.And then in the committee, you said, I want to bring people out of the shadows.(BELL RINGS)Now you want to trump Trump on immigration. But you cant  were not gonna beat Hillary Clinton with someone whos willing to say or do anything to win an election.KELLY: Go ahead, Senator Cruz.(APPLAUSE)CRUZ: You know, I like Marco. Hes very charming. Hes very smooth. But the facts are simple. When he ran for election in the state of Florida, he told the people of Florida, if you elect me, I will lead the fight against amnesty.When I ran in Texas, I told the people of Texas, if you elect me, I will lead the fight against amnesty. We both made the identical promises. But when we came to Washington, we made a different choice.Marco made the choice to go the direction of the major donors  to support amnesty because he thought it was politically advantageous.(BELL RINGS)I honored my commitments, and as president, I will honor every commitment that I make to the men and women of this country.(APPLAUSE)KELLY: All right.CHRISTIE: Megyn? KELLY: Go ahead, Governor Christie.CHRISTIE: I want to ask the people of the audience. Like, Im standing here, I  I watched the video of Senator Cruz. I watched the video of Senator Rubio. I heard what they said. And this is why you need to send someone from outside of Washington to Washington. (APPLAUSE)CHRISTIE: I feel like...(APPLAUSE)... I feel like I need  I feel like I need a Washington to English dictionary converter, right?(LAUGHTER)I mean, I heard what they both said, I saw it on the video. And the fact is this is what makes a difference when youre a governor. You can change your mind. Ted can change his mind. Marco can change his mind. Its perfectly legal in this country to change your mind. But when youre a governor, you have to admit it. You cant hide behind parliamentary tricks. Thats the difference, and thats the kind of leader we need in the White House. Stop the Washington bull and lets get things done.(APPLAUSE)KELLY: Lets go to a Youtube question. Lets get to a Youtube question. This is a question from a Youtube creator with over 2 million subscribers. Watch.QUESTION: Im Dulce Candy, a Youtube creator who immigrated to the United States from Mexico when I was a little girl. Since then, I am proud to say I served in the armed forces in Iraq, became a citizen and I am now an entrepreneur.There are many immigrants who contribute positively to the American economy, but some of the comments in the campaign make us question our place in this country. If America does not seem like a welcoming place for immigrant entrepreneurs, will the American economy suffer?KELLY: Dr. Carson, thats one  that ones for you.CARSON: Oh, great.(LAUGHTER)As I said before, we are a land of immigrants, but we have to be intelligent about the way that we form our immigration policies, and thats one of the reasons that I have called on us to declare war on the Islamic State because we need to reorient our immigration policies and our visa policies for people who are coming into this country because there are many people out there who want to destroy us.Now, I recognize that the vast majority of people coming in here probably are not those kinds of people, but thats not good enough. If youve got 10 people coming to your house and you know one of them is a terrorist, youre probably going to keep them all out.You know, we probably have to figure out a way to make sure that we keep America safe.(APPLAUSE)BUSH: Can I  can I  I just...KELLY: Go ahead.BUSH: That beautiful young woman whos an entrepreneur who served in the military, first of all, is deserving of our respect for service in the military and the fact that shes an entrepreneur.(APPLAUSE)And we should be a welcoming nation. Our identity is not based on race or ethnicity, its based on a set of shared values. Thats American citizenship. And Dulce Candy  a pretty cool name, actually  that is now an entrepreneur over Youtube is part of that American spirit, and we should celebrate it as conservatives. Thats what we believe in.You can  you can deal with the threat of terror and also recognize that this country should be aspirational across the board.RUBIO: And I think thats the false choice...(APPLAUSE)... thats the  thats the false choice in this whole debate about immigration. Of course, were going to be a nation of immigrants. By the way, no nation on earth is more generous than America is. Every single year close to a million people emigrate to the United States legally. Theres no nation on earth that comes close to that number.I think the only argument is are we a sovereign country, are we not allowed to choose who comes in, when they come in and how they come in? And thats not whats happening now.(APPLAUSE)KELLY: All right.RUBIO: I think the other problem is we have a legal immigration system thats outdated, its primarily based on whether you have family members living here. In the 21st century, it has to be more of a merit-based system, and that is why our legal immigration system is in need of modernization. And we will always celebrate legal immigration like Dulces great story.KELLY: All right. Were moving on.(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Gentlemen, were going to turn now to what we call electability, issues that youre either facing in the primaries or issues that youre certainly going to face in a general election. So you may not be altogether unhappy if youre not included in this round.(LAUGHTER)Senator Cruz, you pride yourself on standing up to the D.C. cartel, but as weve seen to a certain degree tonight, theres a price for standing up to the D.C. cartel. Thirteen Republican senators have endorsed other candidates, none have endorsed you.You  twice last year, you asked for a colleague to second a motion, a routine courtesy on the Senate floor, and no senator would do it. Top GOP officials worry that if youre at the top of the ticket  some officials  that not only will you lose the White House, but it will tank the ticket all the way down the line.The question is does your style sometimes get in the way of your ability to get things done, sir?CURZ: Well, Chris, you are exactly right that I am not the candidate of career politicians in Washington. (APPLAUSE)CRUZ: And Ill tell you the endorsements that I am proud of are the over 200,000 volunteers across this country who have signed up to volunteer for our campaign. The endorsements that I am proud of are leading conservatives like Iowas own Congressman Steve King, who is a national co-chairman of my campaign. The endorsements that Im proud of are conservative leaders like Dr. James Dobson, and over 700,000 contributions nationwide, people going to our Web site, tedcruz.org.This is a grassroots campaign and, you know, when I ran for senate in Texas, I told the people of Texas that Im not going there to go along to get along. Washington is broken.And the people I have been accountable to every single day in the Senate are the 27 million Texans who I represent and I made a promise to them that I make to you today, which is, if I am elected, every single day I will do two things: tell the truth, and do what I said I would do.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Thank you.KELLY: Governor bush, poll after poll shows you running among the worst in your party against Hillary Clinton. Even Mitt Romney said that a Bush v. Clinton head-to-head would be too easy for the Democrats.Yet still you and the super PACs supporting you continue to blanket the airwaves with cutting ads, not against Mrs. Clinton, but against your fellow Republicans, especially Senator Rubio.Do these attacks do more harm than good by targeting those candidates who appear to have the best chance of defeating Mrs. Clinton?BUSH: Well, first of all, Ive seen polls where Im beating Hillary Clinton pretty regularly.And I believe I can, because I have a proven record, a record of accomplishment, a record of cutting taxes, of shrinking the government, of reforming education, of challenging the status quo, eliminating career civil service protections, shrinking the government workforce by 11 percent, but leading the nation in job growth. Thats the record of accomplishment that should be taken to Hillary Clinton, who has no record of accomplishment. So Im confident if I win this nomination, I will aggressively go against her and beat her.As it relates to the super PACs, I have no control over that. And this is beanbag compared to what the Clinton hit machine is going to do to the Republican nominee. The simple fact is, we all have a record. It all will be scrutinized. Theres give and take. Its called the politics. And thats the way it is.Im running hard and I believe Ill be the Republican nominee and Ill be the one best suited to beat Hillary Clinton, who should not be president of the United States.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Senator Rubio, first before I ask you a question, any response to Governor Bush?RUBIO: Well, I believe, and I know that if Iowa helps make me the Republican nominee, I will defeat Hillary Clinton. Hillary doesnt want to run against me, but I cannot wait to run against her. And I cannot wait to earn the opportunity to do it because she cannot be the president of the United States.She wants to put Barack Obama on the Supreme Court of the United States of America. She said that here in Iowa just two days ago. That would be a disaster for this country.So I hope and pray and cannot wait until this state and others give me an opportunity to serve this party as its nominee because I will defeat Hillary Clinton.(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)BAIER: Now lets talk about electability, Senator. TIME magazine once called you the Republican savior. Rush Limbaugh and others said you likely will be president some day.But if you look at the recent average of polls in your home state of Florida, youre in third trailing Donald trump by 24 points. If the people who know you best have you there, why should the rest of the country elect you?RUBIO: Well, let me be clear about one thing, theres only one savior and its not me. Its Jesus Christ who came down to earth and died for our sins.(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: And so  and Ive always made that clear about that cover story.As far as the polls are concerned, Iowa, on Monday night youre going to go to a caucus site and youll be the first Americans that vote in this election. You will be the first Americans that get to answer the fundamental question, what comes next for this country after seven disastrous years of Barack Obama?And let me tell you what the answer better not be. It better not be Bernie Sanders. Bernie Sanders is a socialist. I think Bernie Sanders is good candidate for president of Sweden.(LAUGHTER)We dont want to be Sweden. We want to be the United States of America.(APPLAUSE)And Hillary Clinton, Hillary Clinton is disqualified from being the commander-in-chief of the United States. In fact, one of her first acts as president may very well be to pardon herself because Hillary Clinton...(LAUGHTER)Hillary Clinton stored classified information on her private server. And Hillary Clinton lied to the families of those four brave Americans who lost their life in Benghazi. And anyone who lies to the families of Americans who have died in the service of this country can never be commander-in-chief of the United States.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Thank you, Senator.WALLACE: Governor Christie, two of your former top aides go on trial in May for fraud and conspiracy in the Bridge-gate case, the politically motivated closure of lanes to the George Washington Bridge.Another former aide who has already pleaded guilty and will likely testify for the government, as you know, says that you knew about this whole deal. Can the GOP take the chance of nominating you with this scandal still out there, sir?CHRISTIE: Sure, because there has been three different investigations and proven that I knew nothing. And the fact is that what I did do, what I did do from the beginning, Chris, as soon as I found out about it, I fired the people who were responsible. And thats what you expect from a leader.CHRISTIE: And, Ill tell you something else. I inherited a state in New Jersey that was downtrodden, and beaten by liberal democratic policies, high taxation, high regulation. And, this year, in 2015, New Jerseys had the best year of job growth that our state has ever had in the last 15 years. Thats because weve put conservative policies in place.And, Ill tell you one other thing, you know why the Republican party will want to take a chance on me? Because they know that Hillary Clinton will never be prosecuted by this justice department, and theyre going to want to put a former federal prosecutor on the stage to prosecute her next September. And, there is no one on this stage better prepared to prosecute the case against Hillary Clinton than I am.I will be ready. I will take her on, and when I take her on I guarantee you one thing, she will never get within 10 miles of the White House. The days for the Clintons in public housing are over.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Much more to come, including where the candidates stand on foreign policy. And, once again, you can go to Google.com, or open your Google search app and search, Fox News Debate to vote on which candidate you think is winning the debate tonight. Well be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Welcome back, everybody. Lets get back to the questions. Chris?WALLACE: Gentlemen, almost 60% of Republican caucus-goers identify themselves as Evangelicals, so Id like to spend a few minutes exploring social issues.Governor Kasich, you talk a good deal about your faith. In fact, you say it played a role in your decision to expand Medicaid, and you say that when you meet Saint Peter at the Pearly Gates, hes going to ask what you did for the poor, not what you did to keep government small.Senator Cruz is on the opposite side of this issue from you, so does that mean that youre getting in and he isnt?(LAUGHTER)KASICH: No. You know, Chris, heres what happened with Medicaid in my state. We took the growth of Medicaid from over 10 percent in my second budget to 2.5 percent, without cutting off one person or cutting one benefit, because we  we innovated the government.And now mom and dad can stay in their own home, rather than being forced into a nursing home. And then we decided we could bring $14 billion of our money  I mean, Washington doesnt have any money. It was our money, and we brought them back to tend to the mentally ill. Because I dont think they ought to live in prison or live under a bridge; to treat the drug-addicted so theyre not in an in-and-out-of- the-door policy out of the prisons; and to help the working poor so they dont live in emergency rooms.How has it worked? Well, we have treated the drug-addicted in our prisons and we released them in to the community, and our recidivism rate is less than 20 percent. Thats basically bordering on a miracle because of our great prison director. The mentally ill? Theyve been stepped on for too long in this society, and we are beginning to treat them.In terms of my faith, look, all I say is that when I study scripture, I know that people who live in the shadows need to have a chance. But Im not deciding that anybodys got to make these decisions the way that I do, on the basis of what I do. But what  I will tell you this. The time has come to stop ignoring the mentally ill in this country and begin to treat them and get them on their feet, along with, of course, with treating the drug-addicted.(APPLAUSE)Because we dont want them in and out  we dont want them in and out of the prisons. Give people a chance. We talked about criminal justice reform. Weve enacted it in our state. Look, the conservative message is economic growth and along with economic growth goes opportunity for everybody in America. Everybody ought to have a chance to be able to rise to their God-given purpose.And that is what we have done in Ohio. Were running surpluses. Were up 400,000 jobs. And guess what? The formula is working. Id suggest people take a look at it.Thank you.(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Gentlemen, we had a case study on religious liberty just this last summer. A county clerk in Kentucky named Kim Davis refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples after the Supreme Court ruling, saying that it violated her religious beliefs.Governor Christie, you said that she must follow the law or be moved to another job that would be in keeping with her conscience. But some conservatives say that that violates her religious liberty.CHRISTIE: No, what I said, Chris, was that the law needs to be followed. And that someone in that office has to do their job. So if Ms. Davis wanted to step aside and get rid of her ability to be able to do that, there should be someone else in that office who it didnt violate their conscience so they could follow the law of the state of Kentucky.I never said that Ms. Davis should either lose her job or that she had to do it. But what I did say was that the person who came in for the license needed to get it. And so if theres someone in that organization, and it turns out there was, who was willing to be able to do that, thats what we should do.But just as importantly, and I agree with what John said. You know, we all have our own individual interpretations of our faith. And heres the problem with whats going on around the world. The radical Islamic jihadists, what they want to do is impose their faith upon each and every one of us  every one of us. And the reason why this war against them is so important is that very basis of religious liberty.They want everyone in this country to follow their religious beliefs the way they do. They do not want us to exercise religious liberty. Thats why as commander in chief, I will take on ISIS, not only because it keeps us safe, but because it allows us to absolutely conduct our religious affairs the way we find in our heart and in our souls. As a Catholic, thats what I want to do. And no matter what your faith is, thats what I want you to be able to do.(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Thank you, sir.Senator Rubio, during the last debate, you said Governor Christie had changed his position and his mind on gun control, on common core, and backing President Obamas nomination of Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court. He said youre wrong on the facts and you cant, quote, slime your way to the White House. I assume in the last two weeks, youve done some fact-checking. Do you want to take anything back?RUBIO: Yeah, I would encourage people to go on my website, marcorubio.com, and well put all the facts up there so people can see it for themselves. But youve just asked a very fundamental question about the role of faith in our country. And I think this is an important question. I think if you do not understand that our Judeo-Christian values are one of the reasons why America is such a special country, you dont understand our history. You see, why are we one of the most generous people in the world  no, the most generous people in the world? Why do Americans contribute millions of dollars to charity?It is not because of the tax writeoff. It is because in this nation, we are influenced by Judeo-Christian values that teach us to care for the less fortunate, to reach out to the needy, to love our neighbor. This is whats made our nation so special.And you should hope that our next president is someone that is influence by their faith. Because if your faith causes you to care for the less fortunate, it is something you want to see in your public figures. And when Im president, I can tell you this, my faith will not just influence the way Ill govern as president, it will influence the way I live my life.RUBIO: Because in the end, my goal is not simply to live on this earth for 80 years, but to live an eternity with my creator. And I will always allow my faith to influence everything I do.(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Thank you, senator.Senator Paul, in May on the campaign trail you, said you didnt get into politics to fight about abortion. You said you were more concerned about the national debt. Your answer is to turn abortion back to the states the way it was before Roe v. Wade.Does that mean that if a liberal state, lets say, wants to make abortion legal, that youre okay with that and what do you say to conservative voters who believe deeply that abortion is murder?PAUL: You know, I think abortion is always wrong. Ive supported a variety of solutions, both state as well as federal. In fact, just last week, I introduced the Life at Conception act, which would say that the 14th amendment would defend an individual even in the womb.But I think on the broader question of religion and politics, you know, I think liberty, itself requires a virtue  requires a virtuous people. In fact, Washington said that democracy requires a virtuous people.Oz Guinness, the theologian, said that liberty requires restraint but the only restraint consistent with liberty is self-restraint. Theres a lot packed into that statement. But the bottom line is we must have virtue, we must have a religious bearing as a nation. The government is not always going to save us and its not always going to come from government.But if we dont know right and wrong, I think we have lost our way. I think we become unmoored and I think without the religious foundation that guides us all, I think we have a great risk of going horribly in the wrong direction.WALLLACE: Sir, just 30 seconds to answer my specific...(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Just 30 seconds to answer my specific question. Do you favor the idea that abortion should be a states rights issue and if a liberal state wants to make it legal, that thats their choice? Yes or no?PAUL: Both. No, both the federal and a state approach. I have said that we could leave it to the states but Ive also introduced a federal solution as well. So the federal solution would be the Life at Conception act which is an act that would federalize the issue.But Ive also said for the most part, these issues would be left back to the states. So there might be an occasion if we did overturn Roe v. Wade  Roe v. Wade nationalized the issue. If you had the court reverse Roe v. Wade, it would become a state issue once again.I think it would be better the more  the less abortions we have, so the more states that we have that made abortion illegal, the better, as far as trying to save and preserve lives.WALLACE: Thank you, sir.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Gentlemen.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Id like to ask you a few questions about foreign policy broadly.Dr. Carson, many experts believe Russian leader Vladimir Putin has greater ideas, bigger designs for the region beyond Russias actions inside Ukraine. Fast forward to February 2017 and it is President Carson, and Russian uniformed commandos cross the Estonian border and they occupy a city in Estonia. Estonia, a member of NATO, essentially invokes Article IV, an attack on one is an attack on all. What do you do?CARSON: Look, first of all, I recognize that Vladimir Putin is an opportunist and hes a bully, and we have to face him down. And I would  first of all, face him down in that whole region, the whole Baltic region. I think we need to put in some armored brigades there. We only have one or two. We need much more than that. We need to be doing military exercises if not only Estonia but Latvia and Lithuania. Theyre terrified by the saber rattling. I think we ought to put in our missile defense system.I think we ought to give Ukraine offensive weapons and I think we ought to fight them on the economic basis because Putin is a one- horse country: oil and energy. And we ought to fight them on that level.We ought to be helping in terms of the technology for fracking, keeping the price low, quite frankly, because thats whats keeping him contained. So, yes, Id absolutely would go in if he attacked. I think on Article IV of NATO, we would definitely protect all of our allies.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Gentlemen, youve all said that the Iran nuclear deal is a bad one.Senator Rubio, you were among the candidates whove said you would tear it up on day one. But as you know, Iran has already received tens of millions of dollars  tens of billions of dollars in this deal and has quickly reestablished ties economically with Europe.The major concessions, in other words, are up front in this deal. So should you win by the time you take office, the remaining parts of the deal would be the constraints on Iran. So why blow up those constraints on day one, letting Iran off the hook?RUBIO: Well, let me first describe Iran because theyre not just a normal nation state. And we have no quarrel with the Iranian people. But the Iranian leader, their supreme leader is a radical Shia cleric who has an apocalyptic vision of the future. RUBIO: He views himself not simply as the leader of Iran, but as the leader of all Muslims  all Shia Muslims on the planet. And they have a desire not simply to conquer the Middle East and to become the dominant power in that region, but ultimately to be able to hold America hostage.That is why theyre building an  right now, developing long- range missiles capable of reaching the United States, and that is why theres going  theyre going to use those $100 billion to expand their conventional capabilities and to one day buy or build a nuclear weapon.We will  when I am president of the United States, on my first day in office, we are canceling the deal with Iran, and nations will have to make a choice. They can do business with Iran, or they can do business with America, and I am very confident theyre going to choose America before they choose the Iranian economy.BAIER: Governor Kasich, youve said that Marco Rubio is wrong...(APPLAUSE)... that Senator Rubio is wrong with tearing it up on day one.KASICH: Look, we dont know whats going to happen in ten months. And if I were president of the United States right now, Id be lining up our allies to say that, if one crossed T or one dotted I does not occur, they are  violate the agreement, we slap back on sanctions.We can slap on sanctions alone, on day one, but its not gonna be anywhere near as effective. But the president needs to be laying the groundwork right now for the ability to slap those sanctions back on worldwide.And Ill tell you what Im worried about  Im worried about money. You read about all the companies now that are doing business  about to do business in Iran, and if we dont get this settled now, with other countries in the world, about sanctions, then Iran could violate that agreement, and were the only ones putting the sanctions on.We need to move aggressively now. But I would say this to you, Bret. Number one, if they violate it, we need to move against them. And number two, if we find out theyre developing a nuclear weapon and we know how to get to it, were gonna go take it out. That is what we have to do. We cannot let things get farther down the road, like we did with North Korea.BAIER: But Governor Kasich, you know that the most powerful sanctions are the multilateral ones.KASICH: Thats right. Yes.BAIER: And these European countries are already reestablishing these ties.KASICH: I know, Bret.BAIER: They dont want...KASICH: But Bret, heres the problem. You take a look at the  at Belgium. I talked to a diplomat from Belgium. I said, hows it going? He said, we have the military in the streets right now. We never dreamt wed ever see it.See, I think there is an opportunity to bring the world together. The Turks are being threatened. We know about the French. We know about the Belgians. We know about the Brits. Everybody is under fire and under attack, and we have to stand together as an alliance.So actually, the opportunity is there, because of the threat to all of these countries, to bring all of us together...(BELL RINGS)... and say there is something more important than money. It is the future of the world and the future of our children and grandchildren. Thats the kind of leadership this country needs. It has not been in effect during the administration of Barack Obama.And thats only the beginning of the failures that they have committed, not only in the Middle East, but all over the world, including Russia and China.BAIER: Governor, thank you. Governor Christie...(APPLAUSE)... Libya is the newest base for ISIS. Just today, Defense Secretary Ashton Carter said ISIS is consolidating their footprint there and also setting up training facilities.So if you were president, would you deploy U.S. troops to Libya to take out ISIS there?CHRISTIE: Bret, let me tell you, this is another one of those places where Hillary Clinton has so much to answer for, and why she is completely unqualified to be commander in chief.In a previous Democratic debate, Martha Raddatz, three times, asked Hillary Clinton about the failure in Libya, a policy that she took credit for, and said, what is your measure of responsibility, Madam Secretary, for the failure in Libya? Three times, she refused to answer the question, because she refuses to be held accountable for anything that goes wrong. If it had gone right, believe me, she would have been running around to be able to take credit for it.Heres what Id do. This is about the bigger, broader war against ISIS. We need to bring together our European and our Sunni Arab allies, and we need to develop a strategy together to take on ISIS every place that it is around the world, so that together, all of us can take ISIS out, destroy it, and then move on to come back to our country, protect our homeland security and make sure that the American people are safe.As president of the United States, that is exactly what I will do.BAIER: Thank you, Governor.(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Were not finished yet. More to come from the presidential debate, live from Des Moines, Iowa, next. And remember, to see how the campaigns are responding to the debate in real time, go togoogle.com or open your Google search app and search Fox News debate, and please stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Welcome back to Des Moines. Lets resume the debate. Megyn?KELLY: Senator Paul, you have suggested that former President Bill Clintons history with women is fair game in this campaign. How do you answer those who say you dont hold the sins of the husband against the wife?PAUL: You know, Ive never really brought this up unless asked the question, but I have responded to the question. I dont blame Hillary Clinton at all for this. I dont think shes responsible for his behavior. But I do think that her position as promoting womens rights and fairness to women in the workplace, that if what Bill Clinton did any CEO in our country did with an intern, with a 22-year- old, 21-year-old intern in their office, they would be fired. They would never be hired again.(APPLAUSE)Fired, never hired again and probably shunned in their community. And the thing is, she cant be a champion of womens rights at the same time shes got this that is always lurking out there, this type of behavior. So it is difficult.KELLY: Of her husbands?PAUL: Yeah. But I combine this also with the millions upon millions of dollars theyve taken from regimes in the Middle East who treat women like cattle.(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: We have another question from one of Youtubes top creators. Here it is.QUESTION: Im Nabela Noor. Im a Muslim American born and raised in the U.S. who creates beauty and lifestyle videos on Youtube.In 2015, the number of hate crimes against Muslims in the U.S. has tripled, and on social media, where I spend a lot of time, Ive seen many attacks directed towards fellow Muslims. This culture of hatred is only driving ISIS to radicalize, recruit and incite violence.As president, what would you do to address this toxic climate and promote increased tolerance in the United States?WALLACE: Governor Bush, how do you answer Nabela?BUSH: Well first of all, I think its important that when were running for the highest office in the land that we recognize that were living in dangerous times and we have to be serious about it, that our words have consequences.Donald Trump, for example  Im glad  I mentioned his name again just if anybody was missing him... (LAUGHTER)BUSH: ... Mr. Trump believed that in reaction to peoples fears that we should ban all Muslims. Well, that creates an environment thats toxic in our own country. Nobela (ph) is a rising entrepreneur. She wants to pursue the American dream. Shes an American citizen. She should not feel uncomfortable about her citizenship. Shes not the threat. The threat is Islamic terrorism.We need to focus our energies there, not these broad, blanket, kind of statements that will make it harder for us to deal with ISIS. We need to deal with ISIS in the caliphate. We need a strategy to destroy ISIS there. You cant do that without the cooperation of the Muslim world because theyre as threatened as we are.So, I think its important for us to be careful about the language we use, which is why Ive been critical of Donald Trump. Disparaging women, disparaging hispanics, thats not a sign of strength. Making fun of disabled people...(BELL RINGING)BUSH: ... Were never going to win elections if we dont have a more broader unifying message.(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Governor, thank you. Senator Cruz, change of subject. You called for an end to the renewable fuel standards which mandate that refineries blend biofuels, including ethanol into gasoline. As you well know, ethanols a big industry in this state, $10 billion dollars a year.Last week, Terry Branstad, the popular Governor of Iowa...(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: ... Who is in the hall tonight, said that youre bankrolled by big oil, and that Iowa voters would be making a mistake supporting you. Why should those voters side with you over the six- term governor of the state, sir?CRUZ: Well, Chris, Im glad to discuss my views on ethanol and energy. I think God has blessed this country with enormous natural resources, and we should pursue all of the above. We should be developing oil, and gas, and coal, and nuclear, and wind, and solar, and ethanol, and biofuels. But, I dont believe that Washington should be picking winners and losers. And, I think there should be no mandates, and no subsidies whatsoever.(APPLAUSE)CRUZ: And, indeed, my tax plan that Ive introduced, its available on our website. Its a simple flat tax for everyone. Itll produce enormous economic growth, and it eliminates every mandate, every subsidy, so theres no subsidies for oil and gas, no subsidies for anyone.Now, it is true that there are a bunch of lobbyists, and a bunch of Democrats in this state spending millions of dollars trying to convince the people of Iowa that I somehow oppose ethanol. Its not true. I have introduced legislation that would phase out the ethanol mandate over five years, but that is in the context of having no mandates whatsoever for anyone.And, I would not that theres a much more important government regulation to ethanol, and thats the EPAs blend wall that makes it illegal to sell mid-level blends of ethanol in gasoline. I will...(BELL RINGING)CRUZ: ... Tear down the EPAs blend wall which will enable ethanol to expand its market share by up to 60%, all without mandates. All without any government mandates whatsoever through the marketplace. And, Ill note finally, Chris, there is a reason that Iowas Congressman Steve King, perhaps the fiercest defender of farmers in this state, is sharing my campaign. Because he understands that Im committed to a fair, and level playing field for every energy source without lobbyists, and without Washington picking winners and losers.(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Dr. Carson, Id like to ask you about exactly that issue. Where are you on the mandatory ethanol standard, and precisely this question. Should government be in the business of picking winners and losers, or should it be left to the market place?CARSON: Well, as anyone knows whos been listening to me, you know? Im very much against the government being involved in every aspect of our lives, you know? We last year there was an additional 81,000 pages of government regulations. If you stack that up it would be a three-story building. This is absolutely absurd. And, theyve insinuated themselves into everything.Now, as far as the renewable fuel standard is concerned, certain promises were made, certain government contracts were issued which extend all the way into the year 2022, and I believe that its probably unfair to withdraw the rug because people have invested money. People have invested a lot of energy into that.But, you know, we are blessed with tremendous energy in this nation, and we need to be talking for new sources of energy. Seventy percent of our population lives by costly (ph). What about hydroelectric power? We can develop that, you know? We have so much natural gas now, and we can liquify it, and we can transfer it across the sea so we can make Europe dependent on us instead of Putin  put him back in his little box where he belongs.CARSON: Those are the kinds of things that we ought to be doing. And, you know, take advantage of the tremendous opportunities in energy that God has given us, not get involved in these little petty arguments.And we can get a lot of them out if we get the government out of our lives.(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Doctor, thank you.BAIER: Coming up, closing statements from the candidates as our debate continues, live, from Des Moines, Iowa.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)KELLY: Welcome back, everybody. And now, it is time for closing statements. The candidates each get 30 seconds.And we begin with Kentucky Senator Rand Paul.PAUL: Well, thanks for having me. Its great to be back.(APPLAUSE)Im an eye surgeon from Bowling Green, Kentucky, I miss doing eye surgery, still get to do a little bit. Did a couple of cataract surgeries over Christmas holidays. Got to go to Haiti last year. Ive gotten to do some incredible things. Got to be on the floor of the Senate. And it has been amazing to me.But the thing that is most important to me and caused me to run for office is Im worried about the country and how much debt were adding. And I am the one true fiscal conservative who will look at all spending. And thats the only way well ever balance our budget.Thank you.(APPLAUSE)KELLY: Ohio Governor Kasich.KASICH: You know, one of our biggest national security issues is the world looks at us some time, and we look at each other and say, why cant we solve problems? Well, Ive got news for you, we can. We can in fact create jobs and provide job security. We can create a situation where wages begin to rise. We can create a situation for our children to be able to get a decent job to pay down their college debt. We can re-assume our role in the world.But all of this has to come together when we have a positive attitude, an optimistic approach, an ability for us to set the tune as conservatives, to invite other people in to be part of that orchestra. KASICH: You see, ladies and gentlemen, at the end of the day, Im an optimist(BELL RINGS)Because Ive seen so many things get accomplished in my lifetime. And we can do it again together, all of us, to strengthen this country, work together. Thank you.(APPLAUSE) BAIER: New Jersey governor, Chris Christie.CHRISTIE: On September 11, my wife was two blocks from the World Trade Center. When those buildings came down, she was trapped in her building and I didnt hear from her over six hours.We have three children, eight, five and one. And I had to confront the possibility of being a single parent. Terrorism in this country scares everyone. And the fact is that we need a commander-in- chief who not only understands how to protect us, but feels in here what it means to face the possibility of loss.Ive faced it. Ive prosecuted terrorists. I have made the decisions that need to be made as a governor to protect us and as president of the United States, no one will keep this country safer than I will.BAIER: Thank you governor.(APPLAUSE)KELLY: Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush. Governor.BUSH: We desperately need a conservative leader as president of the United States. I have a proven record as governor of the state of Florida, as a conservative leader. And I also have detailed plans to fix the mess in Washington, D.C.As president I will restore and rebuild our military, restore the alliances and keep us safe. And as our partys nominee, I will defeat Hillary Clinton in November. I ask for your support on the caucuses come Monday night and I will make you proud as our partys nominee. Thank you very much.(APPLAUSE) WALLACE: Dr. Ben Carson.CARSON: I want to thank the people of Iowa for being so welcoming to me. Please think of our founding fathers as you listen. We the people of the United States in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, ensure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare and secure the benefits of liberty to ourselves and our prosperity, do ordain and establish this constitution of the United States of America. Folks, its not too late. Enough said.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Florida Senator Marco Rubio.RUBIO: The bible commands us to let our light shine on the world. For over 200 years, Americas light has been shining on the world and the world has never been the same again. But now, that light is dimming a little, after seven years of Barack Obama. And thats why Monday night, what will happen here in Iowa is so important.Im asking you for your vote. Caucus for me on Monday night because if I am your nominee, I will unite this party and I will defeat Hillary Clinton and when Im president, Americas light will shine again and the 21 century will be a new American century.(APPLAUSE)BAIER: Thank you senator.KELLY: Texas Senator, Ted Cruz. Senator.CRUZ: Ninety-three hours. The media noise will soon be over and its now for the men and women of Iowa to decide. Our country is in crisis. Were worried the future of our children and weve have been burned over and over again.The central question in this race is trust. Who do you know will kill the terrorists, defend the constitution and repeal Obamacare? Who do you know will stop amnesty and secure the borders? Who do you know will defend life, marriage and religious liberty? Examine our records, pray on it and I will be honored if you and your family will come caucus for us on Monday night.(APPLAUSE)KELLY: Gentlemen, thank you all so much for being here tonight. We appreciate it greatly. And that does it for the seventh Republican primary debate of the 2016 presidential race. But were not done. The Kelly file starts in a moment and guess who is going to be there? Senator Ted Cruz.WALLACE: And dont forget, after all the talk, the first voting of the 2016 campaign happens in just four days. The first Americans to vote, the Iowa caucuses are Monday and Fox News will have complete coverage.BAIER: And we have you covered from Iowa, all the way to the conventions and on to the general election. Thanks again for joining us. For all of us here in Des Moines," have a great evening.END""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
23,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/05/us/politics/transcript-of-the-democratic-presidential-debate.html,2/5/16,"Following is a transcript of the Democratic debate, as transcribed by the Federal News Service.TODD: Good evening, and welcome to the MSNBC Democratic candidates debate.MADDOW: We are super excited to be here at the University of New Hampshire. Tonight, this is the first time that Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have squared off exactly like this. Face-to-face, just one-on-one, just the two of them.TODD: And neither party has seen this yet. These candidates are both running for the Democratic nomination, but they are very different from each other when it comes to what matters most and how they would go about the job of being president. Our job tonight is to draw out those differences so you, the voters, can understand them and be fully informed.MADDOW: And we do hope that the candidates will take this opportunity to show us the distinctions  show us the differences between them. Thats the whole reason that were here tonight.Were not here for talking points. Were to learn about the difference between the candidates. And with that, lets get going. Please join us in welcoming Secretary Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders.(APPLAUSE)TODD: First, I want to say a special thanks to the New Hampshire union leader for helping make this debate possible, and the readers, who helped provide some of the questions and topics that well be addressing tonight.The rules tonight, by the way, are simple: 90 seconds for answers, 30 seconds for follow-ups and rebuttals.MADDOW: And with that, thats it. Were going to begin with 60- second opening statements from each of the candidates. And as agreed to in advance by the two campaigns, were going to begin tonight with Senator Sanders.SANDERS: Rachel, thank you very much.Millions of Americans are giving up on the political process. And theyre giving up on the political process because they understand the economy is rigged.They are working longer hours for low wages. Theyre worried about the future of their kids, and yet almost all new income and wealth is going to the top 1 percent. Not what America is supposed to be about. Not the fairness that we grew up believing that America was about. And then sustaining that rigged economy is a corrupt campaign finance system undermining American democracy, where billionaire, Wall Street, corporate America can contribute unlimited sums of money into super PACs and into candidates.Our job, together, is to end a rigged economy, create an economy that works for all, and absolutely overturn Citizens United. One person, one vote. Thats what American democracy is about.TODD: Thank you, Senator. Secretary Clinton.CLINTON: Well, Im happy to be here in New Hampshire for this debate, as we move toward the primary on Tuesday.I believe that America has the opportunity to once again live by our values, live up to our values in the 21st century, but I think that America can only do that if Americans can succeed. And there are lots of reasons why Americans today are feeling left out and left behind. CLINTON: Yes, of course, the economy has not been working for most Americans. Yes, of course, we have special interests that are unfortunately doing too much to rig the game.But theres also the continuing challenges of racism, of sexism, of discrimination against the LGBT community, of the way that we treat people as opposed to how we want to be treated.I believe that we can get back on the right track. I want to imagine a country where peoples wages reflect their hard work, where we have healthcare for everyone, and where every child gets to live up to his or her potential.Im fighting for people who cannot wait for those changes, and Im not making promises that I cannot keep.TODD: All right.Lets get started.Secretary Clinton, last night you cited the Concord Monitor when you said of Senator Sanders that, quote, Its very hard to see how any of his proposals could ever be achievable. So please tell us why you think if hes elected president on a platform of promising things like free public college and universal healthcare, that he cannot achieve those things.CLINTON: Well, let me start by saying that Senator Sanders and I share some very big progressive goals. Ive been fighting for universal healthcare for many years, and were now on the path to achieving it. I dont want us to start over again. I think that would be a great mistake, to once again plunge our country into a contentious debate about whether we should have and what kind of system we should have for healthcare.I want to build on the progress weve made; got from 90 percent coverage to 100 percent coverage. And I dont want to rip away the security that people finally have; 18 million people now have healthcare; preexisting conditions are no longer a bar. So we have a difference.I also believe in affordable college, but I dont believe in free college, because every expert that I have talked to says, look, how will you ever control the costs. What I want to do is make sure middle class kids, not Donald Trumps kids, get to be able to afford college. I want to get the economy going again. Its not just enough about what were against, as important as that is. I have a plan to create new jobs, manufacturing, infrastructure, clean energy jobs that will make us the 21st century clean energy super power. I also want to make sure small businesses can start and grow again.And of course, I believe in raising the minimum wage and equal pay for work. But the numbers just dont add up, from what Senator Sanders has been proposing. Thats why all of the independent experts, all of the editorial boards that have vetted both of us have concluded that it is just not achievable.Lets go down a path where we can actually tell people what we will do. A progressive is someone who makes progress. Thats what I intend to do.TODD: Thank you, Secretary.Senator Sanders, so just explain how you spent nearly two decades in Congress and havent gotten any of these things passed. Why do you think as president youll be able to achieve big, big new programs like this?SANDERS: Well, I havent quite run for president before.(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)Lets deal with some of the comments that Secretary Clinton made. And by the way, you know, sometimes theres a lot of drama here. I have known Secretary Clinton for 25 years and respect her very much.Here is the issue. Every major country on earth, whether its the U.K., whether its France, whether its Canada, has managed to provide healthcare to all people as a right and they are spending significantly less per capita on health care than we are. So I do not accept the belief that the United States of America cant do that.I do not accept the belief that the United States of America and our government cant stand up to the ripoffs of the pharmaceutical industry which charge us by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.Number two, in the economy today, everybody understands that we need a well educated workforce. This is 2016. When we talk about public education, it can no longer be K through 12th grade. I do believe that public colleges and universities should be tuition free. Well, how do we pay for that? Its an expensive proposition.I do believe that we should substantially lower student debt in this country, which is crushing millions of people. We pay for it, in my view, by a tax on Wall Street speculation. The middle class bailed out Wall Street in their time of need. Now, it is Wall Streets time to help the middle class.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: If I could just follow up on that.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: There is no disagreement between us on universal coverage for health care, the disagreement is where do we start from and where do we end up.The Republicans want to repeal the Affordable Care Act, I want to improve it. I want to build on it, get the costs down, get prescription drug costs down. Senator Sanders wants us to start all over again. This was a major achievement of President Obama, of our country. It is helping people right now.I am not going to wait and have us plunge back into a contentious national debate that has very little chance of succeeding. Lets make the Affordable Care Act work for everybody.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: Let me...TODD: Go.SANDERS: ... this is a good discussion here.TODD: Yes, go ahead.SANDERS: And let me just say this. As Secretary Clinton may know, I am on the Health Education Labor Committee. That committee wrote the Affordable Care Act. The idea I would dismantle health care in America while were waiting to pass a Medicare for all is just not accurate. The Affordable Care Act has clearly, as Secretary Clinton made the point, done a lot of good things, but, what it has not done is dealt with the fact we have 29 million people today who have zero health insurance, we have even more who are underinsured with large deductibles and copayments and prescription drug prices are off the wall.So I do believe that in the future, not by dismantling what we have here  I helped write that bill  but by moving forward, rallying the American people, I do believe we should have health care for all.(APPLAUSE)TODD: All right, thank you both. Rachel. MADDOW: Secretary Clinton, Senator Sanders is campaigning against you now, at this point in the campaign, basically arguing that you are not progressive enough to be the Democratic nominee. He has said that if you voted for the Iraq war, if you are in favor of the death penalty, if you wobbled on things like the Keystone Pipeline or TPP, if you said single payer health care could never happen, then youre too far to the right of the Democratic Party to be the partys standard bearer.Given those policy positions, why should liberal Democrats support you and not Senator Sanders?CLINTON: Well because I am a progressive who gets things done. And the root of that word, progressive, is progress. But Ive heard Senator Sanders comments, and its really caused me to wonder whos left in the progressive wing of the Democratic Party. Under his definition, President Obama is not progressive because he took donations from Wall Street; Vice President Biden is not progressive because she supported Keystone; Senator Shaheen is not progressive because she supports the trade pact. Even the late, great Senator Paul Wellstone would not fit this definition because he voted for DOMA.You know, we have differences and, honestly, I think we should be talk about what we want to do for the country. But if were going to get into labels, I dont think it was particularly progressive to vote against the Brady Bill five times.(APPLAUSE)I dont think it was progressive to vote to give gun makers and sellers immunity. I dont think it was progressive to vote against Ted Kennedys immigration reform. So we could go back and forth like this, but the fact is most people watching tonight want to know what weve done and what we will do. Thats why I am laying out a specific agenda that will make more progress, get more jobs with rising incomes, get us to universal health care coverage, get us to universal pre-k, paid family leave and the other elements of what I think will build a strong economy, that will ensure Americans keep making progress. Thats what Im offering and thats what I will do as president.(APPLAUSE)MADDOW: Senator Sanders, have you established a list of what it means to be a progressive that is unrealistic?SANDERS: No, not at all. Heres the reality of American economic life today. The reality is that we have one of lowest voter turnouts of any major country on earth because so many people have given up on the political process. The reality is that there has been trillions of dollars of wealth going from the middle class in the last 30 years to the top 1/10th of 1 percent.The reality is we that have a corrupt campaign finance system which separates the American peoples needs and desires from what Congress is doing. So to my mind, what we have got to do is wage a political revolution where millions of people have given up on the political process, stand up and fight back, demand the government that represents us and not just a handful of campaign contribution  contributors. SANDERS: Now all of the ideas that Im talking about, they are not radical ideas. Making public colleges and universities tuition free, that exists in countries all over the world, used to exist in the United States. Rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, and creating 13 million jobs by doing away with tax loopholes that large corporations now enjoy by putting their money into the Cayman Islands and other tax havens. That is not a radical idea.What we need to do is to stand up to the big money interests, and the campaign contributors. When we do that, we can, in fact, transform America.MADDOW: Thank you Senator.(APPLAUSE)TODD: Id like to follow up on a comment that Secretary Clinton said, Senator. President Obama has not called for abolishing the death penalty. President Obama is for the big Asian trade deal known as TPP, and just yesterday you said you cant be both a moderate or a progressive, but you cant be both. Is President Obama, in your judgment, based on these policies positions, a progressive?SANDERS: Let me just pick up on this point. This whole discussion began because I commented, not making overall evaluation about the Secretary. She was in Ohio, I think, in September or November and she got up and said something like, I have been  Im paraphrasing, I have been criticized because people think Im a moderate. Well, I am a moderate.Thats where this came from. It wasnt me paraphrasing her. It is what she said, and all that I said was theres nothing wrong with being a moderate. But, you cant be a moderate, you cant a progressive.In terms of President Obama, I think if we remember where this country was seven years ago, 800,000 jobs being lost every month, $1.4 trillion dollar deficit. The worlds financial system on the verge of collapse. I think that President Obama, Vice President Biden, and the Democratic leadership in the House and the Senate have done a fantastic job. We are in much better shape than we were seven years ago, although my Republican colleagues seem to have forgotten where we were seven years ago. Thats the fact, but, we still have a very long way to go.Do I think President Obama is a progressive? Yes, I do. I disagree with him on a number of issues including the trade agreement. But, yes, I think he has done an excellent job.CLINTON: Well, Chuck...TODD: ... (inaudible) Clinton, go ahead...CLINTON: ... If I could, you know, in the very first debate I was asked am I a moderate or a progressive and I said Im a progressive who likes to get things done. Cherry picking a quote here or there doesnt change my record of having fought for racial justice, having fought for kids rights, having fought the kind of inequities that fueled my interest in service in the first place going back to my days in the Childrens Defense Fund.It certainly didnt stop me from taking on the drug companies and the insurance companies. Before it was called Hillarycare  I mean, before it was called ObamaCare it was called Hillarycare because we took them on, and we werent successful, but we kept fighting and we got the childrens health insurance program. Every step along the way I have stood up, and fought, and have the scars to prove it.So, again...(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: ... I think its important that, look, I understand Senator Sanders really trying to distinguish himself. I understand that, thats what you do in campaigns, but at the same time lets not be  in, I think an unfair way, making an accusation, or making an attack about where I stand and about where Ive always stood.It is fair to say, Senator, that in your definition, as you being the self-proclaimed gatekeeper for progressivism, I dont know anyone else who fits that definition, but I know a lot of really hard fighting progressives in the Democratic party who have stood up time, and time again against special interests, against the powerful on behalf of those who are left behind and left out.And, thats what we ought to be celebrating. Lets talk about what we would do as President, and Commander in Chief to make sure the progress continues into the future.(APPLAUSE)TODD: (inaudible) 30 seconds, and then well move.SANDERS: Thats right, I mean, instead of arguing about definitions, lets talk about...CLINTON: ... Well, you began it yesterday with your comments...SANDERS: ... What we should do, and one of the things we should do is not only talk the talk, but walk the walk. I am very proud to be the only candidate up here who does not have a Super PAC, whos not raising huge sums of money from Wall Street...(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: ... And special interests. I am enormously proud. Never believed it would happen that we have raised 3.5 million individual contributions, averaging $27 dollars a piece. That is what the political revolution means.(APPLAUSE)TODD: Thank you.MADDOW: Senator Sanders, as a Vermonter, you have almost a home state advantage here in New Hampshire. But back home across the border, you also have a long history of running against Democrats as a third-party candidate, for governor, Senate, for Congress.In 1988 your candidacy as a third-party candidate arguably cost the Democrats a congressional seat and sent a Republican instead.How can you lead the Democratic Party nationally when you have not been a member of the Democratic Party until very recently?SANDERS: Well, Rachel, actually, that wasnt accurate. In 1988 the Republican did win, I believe, by 3 points. I came in second. It was 34-31, I think, 19 for the Democrat. In that race the Democrat was the spoiler, not me. And it is true...(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: It is true, its not to be denied, I am the longest- serving independent in the history of the United States Congress. People of Vermont sent me to Washington as an independent. That is true.But on the other hand, I have  when I was in the House for 16 years, I caucused with the Democrats. In the Senate for nine years caucused with the Democrats, of course. And I was elected by the Democrats to be chair of the Veterans Committee three years ago, which Im very proud of. And now am the rankings member on the Budget Committee, leader of the Democrats in opposition to the majority Republicans.I am running for president as a Democrat. And if elected, not only do I hope to bring forth a major change in national priorities, but let me be frank, I do want to see major changes in the Democratic Party.I want to see working people and young people come into the party in a way that doesnt exist now. And you know what, I want a 50-state strategy so the Democratic Party is not just the party of 25 states.(APPLAUSE)MADDOW: Secretary Clinton.CLINTON: You know, the person who first put out the idea of a 50-state party strategy is former Governor Howard Dean, who is with us tonight.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: And Im very proud and grateful to have the support of so many elected Vermonters and former officials. Two former governors, the current governor, the current other senator. I really appreciate that.And I think its because theyve worked with me, theyve seen what I do. They know what kind of a colleague I am. They want me as their partner in the White House. And thats exactly what I will do.Well get things done together. Democrats, Republicans, independents, were going to make progress together when Im president.(APPLAUSE)MADDOW: So, Senator, to that point, Secretary Clinton is raising the issue of endorsements by your home state Democrats. Shes implying that that says something about the people who know you best.SANDERS: Well, I dont see it quite like that.MADDOW: How do you see it?SANDERS: I am  will absolutely admit that Secretary Clinton has the support of far more governors, mayors, members of the House. She has the entire establishment or almost the entire establishment behind her. Thats a fact. I dont deny it.But I am pretty proud that we have over a million people who have contributed to our campaign averaging 27 bucks apiece. That we have had meetings where 25,000-30,000 people have come out. That our campaign is a campaign of the people, by the people, and for the people.So, Rachel, yes, Secretary Clinton does represent the establishment. I represent, I hope, ordinary Americans, and by the way, who are not all that enamored with the establishment, but I am very proud to have people like Keith Ellison and Raul Grijalva in the House, the co-chairmen of the House Progressive Caucus.MADDOW: Secretary.CLINTON: Well, look, Ive got to just jump in here because, honestly, Senator Sanders is the only person who I think would characterize me, a woman running to be the first woman president, as exemplifying the establishment. And Ive got to tell you that it is... (APPLAUSE)CLINTON: It is really quite amusing to me.People support me because they know me. They know my lifes work. They have worked with me and many have also worked with Senator Sanders. And at the end of the day they endorse me because they know I can get things done.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: I am not going to make promises I cant keep. I am not going to talk about big ideas like single-payer and then not level with people about how much it will cost.CLINTON: A respected health economist said that these plans would cost a trillion dollars more a year.Im not going to tell people that I will raise your incomes and not your taxes, and not mean it, because I dont want to see the kind of struggle that the middle class is going through exemplified by these promises that would raise taxes and make it much more difficult for many, many Americans to get ahead and stay ahead. That is not my agenda.(APPLAUSE)MADDOW: Senator Sanders, youll have 30 seconds to respond to that.SANDERS: What being part of the establishment is, is, in the last quarter, having a super PAC that raised $15 million from Wall Street, that throughout ones life raised a whole lot of money from the drug companies and other special interests.To my mind, if we do not get a handle on money in politics and the degree to which big money controls the political process in this country, nobody is going to bring about the changes that is needed in this country for the middle class and working families.CLINTON: Yeah, but I  I think its fair to really ask whats behind that comment. You know, Senator Sanders has said he wants to run a positive campaign. Ive tried to keep my disagreements over issues, as it should be.But time and time again, by innuendo, by insinuation, there is this attack that he is putting forth, which really comes down to  you know, anybody who ever took donations or speaking fees from any interest group has to be bought.And I just absolutely reject that, Senator. And I really dont think these kinds of attacks by insinuation are worthy of you. And enough is enough. If youve got something to say, say it directly.But you will not find that I ever changed a view or a vote because of any donation that I ever received.SANDERS: What...(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: And I have stood up and I have represented my constituents to the best of my abilities, and Im very proud of that.SANDERS: ... you know...CLINTON: So I think its time to end the very artful smear that you and your campaign have been carrying out...SANDERS: (inaudible).(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: ... in recent weeks, and lets talk...(BOOING)... lets talk about about the issues. Lets talk about the issues that divide us.SANDERS: Lets talk about  OK, lets talk...CLINTON: And lets  lets...SANDERS: ... let us talk about issues.CLINTON: ... we both agree with campaign finance reform.SANDERS: Lets talk about issues.CLINTON: I  I worked hard for McCain-Feingold.SANDERS: Lets...CLINTON: I want to reverse Citizens United.SANDERS: ... lets  lets  lets talk about issues.CLINTON: And so  lets talk about issues.SANDERS: Lets talk  lets talk about issues, all right? Lets talk about why, in the 1990s, Wall Street got deregulated. Did it have anything to do with the fact that Wall Street provided  spent billions of dollars on lobbying and campaign contributions?Well, some people might think, yeah, that had some influence.(LAUGHTER)Lets ask why it is that we pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs, and your medicine can be doubled tomorrow, and theres nothing that the government can do to stop it.You think it has anything to do with the huge amounts of campaign contributions and lobbying from the fossil fuel industry? Lets talk about climate change.Do you think theres a reason why not one Republican has the guts to recognize that climate change is real, and that we need to transform our energy system? Do you think it has anything to do with the Koch brothers and ExxonMobil pouring huge amounts of money into the political system?That is what goes on in America. I am not  I like...(APPLAUSE)... there is a reason. You know, there is a reason why these people are putting huge amounts of money into our political system. And in my view, it is undermining American democracy and it is allowing Congress to represent wealthy campaign contributors and not the working families of this country.CLINTON: Well, you know, Senator, I dont think  I dont...(CROSSTALK)(APPLAUSE)TODD: ... Secretary, were gonna...CLINTON: ... I dont think you could find any person in political life today who has been subjected to more attacks and had more money spent against her by special interests, among whom you have named a few, than I.And Im proud of that. You know, when I took on the drug companies and the insurance companies for universal health care coverage, they went after me with a vengeance. CLINTON: Today, youve got hedge fund billionaires aligned with Karl Rove, running ads against me to try to get Democrats to vote for you. I know this game. Im going to stop this game.But while were talking about votes, youre the one who voted to deregulate swaps and derivatives in 2000, which contributed to the over-leveraging of Lehman Brothers, which was one of the culprits that brought down the economy.So I dont know  Im not impugning your motive because you voted to deregulate swaps and derivatives. People make mistakes and Im certainly not saying you did it for any kind of financial advantage. What weve got to do as Democrats  what weve got to do as Democrats is to be united to actually solve these problems. And what I believe is that I have a better track record and a better opportunity to actually get that job done.Thats what this election should be about.(APPLAUSE)TODD: Thirty seconds.(CROSSTALK)(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: I think as Secretary Clinton knows, there is nobody who fought harder. I was on the House Financial Committee at that time. I heard the arguments coming from Democrats and Republicans  Robert Rubin, Alan Greenspan  about great an idea it would be if we did away with Glass-Steagall and if we allowed investor banks and commercial banks and big insurance companies to merge.Go to YouTube today. Look up Greenspan-Sanders. Listen to what I told them then. I helped lead the effort against deregulation. Unfortunately, we lost that. The result is  was the worst financial disaster since the Great Depression.TODD: Thank you both.MADDOW: Senator Sanders, Secretary Clinton, obviously weve touched a nerve. Were going to be back with more on this subject, and much more, right after this. Stay with us.(APPLAUSE)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(APPLAUSE)TODD: All right, welcome back. Lets get right to it.Senator Sanders, you were talking about all of your campaign contributions and campaign finance reform. You rail against big money in politics. But do you realize there is one public financing system that we do have in place, and it is  it is in place to run for president. Why arent you walking the walk on that?Why arent you participating in the presidential public financing system which is designed to essentially keep big money out of presidential politics?SANDERS: Chuck, actually we looked at it, but it turns out to be a disaster. The way it is structured right now, if you make it all the way to California, you could do pretty well. But in terms of the early states  Iowa, New Hampshire, the other states  it just doesnt work.Your point is well taken. I believe in public funding of elections, absolutely. But this system is  I dont know if the secretary would agree  is currently very antiquated and no longer applies to modern day politics.TODD: Well, going on that then, why criticize her on Super PACs, and you got  and all this when it is  you know, thats the system? I mean, you could be participating in a publicly-financing  public financing system...SANDERS: But if the...TODD: ... and being able to set  being able to set an example.SANDERS:  but Chuck, it is a public financing system that everybody knows is antiquated. It no longer works. Nobody can become president based on that system. So whats the alternative? There are two alternatives. And, you know, we looked at it. Well, should we do a Super PAC, but I concluded, honestly, I dont represent Corporate America or billionaires, I didnt want it.So the other alternative was to ask working families and the middle class to help out in a transformational campaign. And you know what? We got 3.5 million individual contributions, $27 a piece. I think thats pretty good.(APPLAUSE)MADDOW: Secretary Clinton, on the issue of Wall Street...CLINTON: On the issue of Wall Street.MADDOW: ... on the issue of Wall Street, when our reporters go out and talk to people on the ground in the early states, what they tell us over and over again when they find voters who are leaning toward Senator Sanders rather than yourself is that the most frequent area of concern that they hear from those voters is the issue of Wall Street and whether or not you are too close to Wall Street.Last night, when you were asked about speaking fees and the amount of speaking fees you got from Goldman Sachs speeches, you said thats what they offered.Have you been too dismissive of voters concerns about this issue in your own campaign and your own career?CLINTON: Well you know, Rachel, I think I may not have done the job I should in explaining my record. You know, I did  when I left the secretary of States office, like so many former officials, military leaders, journalists, others, I did go on the speaking circuit. I spoke to heart doctors, I spoke to the American Camping Association, I spoke to auto dealers, and yes, I spoke to firms on Wall Street. They wanted me to talk about the world, what my experience had been as secretary of State.But what I want people to know is I went to Wall Street before the crash. I was the one saying youre going to wreck the economy because of these shenanigans with mortgages. I called to end the carried interest loophole that hedge fund managers enjoy. I proposed changes in CEO compensation.I called for a consumer protection financial bureau before it was created. And I think the best evidence that the Wall Street people at least know where I stand and where I have always stood is because they are trying to beat me in this primary. They have collected and spent as much as $6 million on these ads. Hedge fund billionaires, Karl Rove, another billionaire, jumped in.And why are they doing that? These are guys who try to make smart investments. They know my record, they know me, they know that I say what I believe and I will do it. And I also have a pr",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tty good understanding about how to stop them.So I do want people to know that, and I think its important for everybody to understand I have a record, I have stood firm and I will be the person who prevents them from ever wrecking the economy again.(APPLAUSE)MADDOW: Senator Sanders, you have been a critic of Secretary Clinton taking those speaking fees and having donations from Wall Street. What about her defense of her record? SANDERS: Let me just say this. Wall Street is perhaps the most powerful economic and political force in this country. You have companies like Goldman Sachs, who just recently paid a settlement fine with the federal government for $5 billion for defrauding investors.Goldman Sachs was one of those companies whose illegal activity helped destroy our economy and ruin the lives of millions of Americans. But this is what a rigged economy and a corrupt campaign finance system and a broken criminal justice is about. These guys are so powerful that not one of the executives on Wall Street has been charged with anything after paying, in this case of Goldman Sachs, a $5 billion fine.Kid gets caught with marijuana, that kid has a police record. A Wall Street executive destroys the economy, $5 billion settlement with the government, no criminal record. That is what power is about. That is what corruption is about. And that is what has to change in the United States of America.(APPLAUSE)(CROSSTALK)CLINTON: If I could, let me just say that of course it has to change. It has to change. And thats why I have put forward a plan to do just that. And its been judged to be the toughest, most effective and comprehensive one.I have great respect for Senator Sanderss commitment to try to restore Glass-Steagall. But I do not believe that that is enough. And in fact, I dont believe it really addresses a lot of the biggest issues we have.You know, we now have power under the Dodd-Frank legislation to break up banks. And Ive said I will use that power if they pose a systemic risk. But I want to go further, because it was investment banks, it was insurance companies, it was mortgage companies, all of which contributed.So lets not just be narrowly focused on one part of the problem. We have a lot of issues with corporate power that have to be addressed. My plan takes us further and it would do the job.(CROSSTALK)(APPLAUSE) SANDERS: I would say that  that folks who have looked at this issue for a long time, whether its Elizabeth Warren or many other economists, will tell you that right now, yes, we do need a 21st century Glass-Steagall legislation. And I would tell you also that when you have three out of the four largest banks in America today, bigger than they were  significantly bigger than when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail, I think if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, a good Republican by the way, what he would say is: Break them up; they are too powerful economically; they are too powerful politically.And that is what I believe and many economists believe. Time to break them up.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: Look we have a law  look, you know, I  I appreciate the senators advocacy. We have a law. It was passed. It was signed by President Obama. It lays out a process that you go through to determine whether a systemic risk is posed.And by the way, President Obama signed that, pushed it through, even though he took donations from Wall Street, because hes a responsible president. So we have a law in place. If the circumstances warrant it, I will certainly use it. And from what you say, I know you will as well.But that is not enough. And I keep going back to this because part of the reason the Wall Street guys are trying so hard to stop me  the hedge fund guys, the shadow banking guys  is because Ive got their number on all of that. And my plan goes so much further to try to prevent the problems of the future.You know, we cant just fight the last war. Weve got to be prepared to stop these guys if they ever try to use their economic power once again, to hurt the economy, and to hurt so many Americans. And my plan, Paul Krugman, Barney Frank, a lot of experts who understand what the new challenges might be, have said I am exactly on point, and the Wall Street guys actually know that.(APPLAUSE)(CROSSTALK)TODD: ... she has had more people praise her plan than yours.SANDERS: Well, weve had a number of economists supporting our legislation. And heres where we are. The American people can judge. Six largest financial institutions in America today have assets of roughly $10 trillion; equivalent to 58 percent of the GDP of the United States of America.SANDERS: That is a lot of money. They issue two thirds of the credit cards, and by the way theyre ripping off a whole lot of people with high interest rates on the credit cards, and they write about one third of the mortgages.That is a lot of power for six financial institutions. Thats it. I think it is too much power. Too much economic power, too much political power, and the economists that I talk to say we should break them up.TODD: Thank you both. Let me move on to our next question here, and in fact it comes to us through New England Cable News.Secretary Clinton, its addressed to you, and its about this issue of the speeches, particularly to Goldman Sachs. This is what the questioner wrote verbatim.I am concerned with the abuses of Wall Street has taken with the American taxpayers money, and then she asks whether you would release the transcripts of your Goldman Sachs speeches, and then added, Dont you think the voting public has a right to know what was said?But, lets make that bigger. Are you willing to release the transcripts of all your paid speeches? We do know through reporting that there were transcription services for all of those paid speeches. In full disclosure, would you release all of them?CLINTON: I will look into it. I dont know the status, but I will certainly look into it. But, I can only repeat what is the fact that I spoke to a lot of different groups with a lot of different constituents, a lot of different kinds of members about issues that had to do with world affairs. I probably described more times than I can remember how stressful it was advising the President about going after Bin Laden.My view on this is look at my record. Look at what I am proposing, and  we have a vigorous agreement here. We both want to reign in the excesses of Wall Street. I also want to reign in the excesses of Johnson Controls that we bailed out when they were an autoparts company, and we saved the auto industry, and now they want to avoid paying taxes.I want to go after the pharmaceutical companies like Valeant, and Turns that are increasing prices without any regard to the impact on peoples health. Now, if all were going to talk about is one part of our economy, and indeed one streak in our economy, were missing the big oil companies. Were missing other big energy companies. Were missing the big picture, and I have a record of trying to go at the problems that actually exist, and I will continue to do that.TODD: Senator, you sound like you want to respond. Go ahead.SANDERS: Yeah, I do. I agree with much of what the Secretary said, but, madam Secretary, it is not one streak. Wall Street is an entity of unbelievable economic and political power. Thats a fact.And, I want to say something, and it may sound harsh, not to you, but to the American people. In a sense, in my view, the business model of Wall Street is fraud. Its fraud. I believe that corruption is rampant, and the fact that major bank after major bank has reached multi billion dollar settlements with the United States government when we have a weak regulator system tells me that not only did we have to bail them out once, if we dont start breaking them up, were going to have to bail them out again, and I do not want to see that happen...CLINTON: ... Well, Senator, no one wants to see that happen. I mean, look, I care deeply about this because just like you I have met so many people who had their life savings wiped out, who lost their homes, who are barely back with their heads above water.This was a disaster for our country, and we can never let that happen again. We have no disagreement about this. But, I think its a broader target list than just Wall Street, and I believe that we have to be very focused on how we try to take back the power and increase the empowerment of the American people. And, I think I have that kind of experience, maybe because theyve beat me up for so many years, and I know exactly how to handle them because Ive been in the arena with them time and time again.MADDOW: Senator Sanders, let me turn to, I think, where this direction is heading anyway, which is the broader issue of big business and power in our political system. You on the campaign trail have railed against big name American corporations like Boeing, and General Electric, and Wal Mart. But, some big businesses in this country have also been part of advancing progressive goals like that nationwide initiative to expand employment opportunities for veterans. That was all about cooperation between the Obama administration and some very big business. The Affordable Care Act, some of the thorniest problems in that bill were worked out in cooperation with big business in order to accomplish progressive goals.Could you work with them, or have you made enemies of big business in this country with the way youve approached them in this campaign?SANDERS: Of course I can work with them, but lets be clear. When I talked about Boeing and I talked about General Electric, what I was referring to is an outrage. I suspect the secretary agrees request me.Right now you have a loophole such that these guys are putting their profits, multi-billion dollar profitable corporations putting billions of dollars into the Cayman Islands, Bermuda, and other tax havens.And in a given year, Rachel, after making billions of dollars in profit, do you know how much theyre paying in taxes to the United States government in a given year? Zero. Now explain to me how that makes any sense at all.So what I have said with regard to Boeing and GE and other multinationals that pay zero taxes, you know what were going to do? Were going to end that loophole. They are going to pay their fair share of taxes.Were going to use that money to rebuild our infrastructure and create up to 13 million jobs.Can I work with corporations? Are there good corporations doing incredible cutting edge research and development? Absolutely they are. And we should be proud of them.But on the other hand, there are many corporations who have turned their backs on the American worker, who have said, if I can make another nickel in profit by going to China and shutting down in the United States of America, thats what I will do.I will do my best to transform our trade policy and take on these corporations who want to invest in low-income countries around the world rather than in the United States of America.(APPLAUSE)MADDOW: Senator Sanders, thank you.And with that, were going to take a break.TODD: Well be right back. And were going to get to trade and a lot of other issues.(APPLAUSE)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MADDOW: Welcome back  welcome back to the Democratic candidates debate. Were going to be talking about America in the world, both in terms of some trade issues, but also national security.And Secretary Clinton, were going to start with you. There are more than 4,000 American troops back in Iraq right now as part of the fight against ISIS. It has been 15 straight years of wars and multiple deployments for Americas military families, who have borne such a disproportionate burden.Is President Obama right to keep escalating the number of U.S. troops thats fighting ISIS right now?CLINTON: Well, I think what the president understands, and what hes trying to do, is that we have to support the Arab and Kurdish fighters on the ground who are actually doing the fighting.I agree with the president. Ive said myself, we will not send American combat troops back to either Syria or Iraq  that is off the table.But we do have special forces, we do have trainers, we do have the military personnel who are helping with the airstrikes that the United States is leading so that we can try to take out ISIS infrastructure, take out their leadership.And I think that, given the threat that ISIS poses to the region and beyond, as we have sadly seen in our own country, it is important to keep the Iraqi army on a path where they can actually take back territory, to work with the Sunni tribes in Anbar province and elsewhere so that their fighters can be also deployed, to work with the Kurds to provide them the support, but theyre doing the fighting. Were doing the support and enabling.And I also think weve got to do more to stop foreign fighters, foreign funding and take ISIS on online, as well as doing everything necessary to keep us safe at home.So as I look at what the president it doing, it adds up to me. We just have to keep  try to get more support for those people on the ground in Syria and Iraq who have to actually physically take the territory back. MADDOW: To be clear, to the specific question, if that strategic goal that youre describing requires considerably more of Americans  an ever-increasing number of Americans in Iraq and maybe in Syria, are you OK with the numbers increasing?CLINTON: No. I mean, of course thats a theoretical question, and we dont know what it would be for, and we dont know how many numbers there are. I am against American combat troops being in Syria and Iraq.I support special forces. I support trainers. I support the air campaign. And I think were making some progress. I want to continue to intensify that, and thats exactly what the president is doing.MADDOW: Thank you, Madam Secretary.TODD: Go ahead, Senator Sanders  30 seconds, your response.SANDERS: OK. Let me agree with much of what the secretary said, but where we have a different background on this issue is we differ on the war in Iraq, which created barbaric organizations like ISIS.Not only did I vote against that war, I helped lead the opposition, and if you go to my website,berniesanders.com, you will see the statement that I made in 2002. And it gives me no pleasure to tell you that much of what I feared would happen the day after Saddam Hussein was overthrown, in fact, did happen.TODD: All right. Senator, I want to stay, though...CLINTON: If I could  if I could...TODD: Go ahead. 30 seconds.CLINTON: ... respectfully add  look, we did differ. A vote in 2002 is not a plan to defeat ISIS. We have to look at the threats that we face right now...(APPLAUSE)... and we have to be prepared to take them on and defeat them.TODD: Let me  let  were gonna  were staying  were staying basically on this topic. Obviously youve been emphasizing this difference on the Iraq war, but one place where you do agree, and one place where you voted to authorize the use of force, was in favor of the war in Afghanistan.Right now, it is possible President Obama is going to be leaving the next president, perhaps President Sanders, at least 10,000 troops in Afghanistan. How long will those troops be in Afghanistan under President Sanders?SANDERS: Well, I think our great task is to make certain that our young men and women in the military do not get sucked into never- ending, perpetual warfare within the quagmire of Syria and Iraq. And I will do my very best to make sure that that doesnt happen.I agree with the secretary that I think what has to happen  and let me just mention what King Abdullah of Jordan said. I think he hit the nail on the head. SANDERS: And what he said is essentially the war against ISIS is a war for the soul of Islam. And it must be Muslim troops on the ground that will destroy ISIS, with the support of a coalition of major powers  U.S., U.K., France, Germany and Russia.So our job is to provide them the military equipment that they need; the air support they need; special forces when appropriate. But at the end of the day for a dozen different reasons, not the least of which is that ISIS would like American combat troops on the ground so they could reach out to the Muslim world and say, Look, were taking on those terrible Americans.The combat on the ground must be done by Muslim troops with our support. We must not get involved in perpetual warfare in the Middle East.TODD: Can you address a question on Afghanistan?(APPLAUSE)(CROSSTALK)TODD: How long are these troops going to be there? If President Obama leaves you 10,000 troops, how long do you think theyre going to be there?SANDERS: Well, you cant simply withdraw tomorrow. Wish we could, and allow, you know, the Taliban or anybody else to reclaim that country. But what we must do, and what we have seen in recent months, is some progress in Iraq, where finally the Iraqi army, which has not been a particularly effective fighting force, retook Ramadi. ISIS has lost I think 40 percent of the territory that it held in the last year.Hopefully, and you know, one cant predict the future, that maybe our training and their fighting capabilities are improving and we are going to make some progress in destroying ISIS.TODD: Secretary Clinton, 30 seconds: How long are these troops going to be in Afghanistan? We have more American troops in Afghanistan than what we were talking about with Iraq.CLINTON: Oh, absolutely. The president decided to leave more troops than he had originally planned in Afghanistan. We have a very cooperative government there, with Ashraf Ghani and his top  his top partner, Abdullah. And they are doing their very best. And the Afghan army is actually fighting. The Afghan army is taking heavy losses defending Afghan territory.And I would have to make an evaluation based on the circumstances at the time I took office as to how much help they continue to need. Because its not just the Taliban. We now are seeing outposts of, you know, fighters claiming to be affiliated with ISIS.So, weve got this arc of instability from North Africa to South Asia, and we have to pay close attention to it. And we have to build coalitions, something that I did to take on the Iranian nuclear program, and what I will do as president to make sure that we defeat these terrorist networks.TODD: You know, Senator Sanders, nobody knows who your foreign policy advisers are. You havent given a major foreign policy speech. And it doesnt sound like all the time that foreign policy is a priority, other than when youre asked about it, and you say youre going to crush ISIS, as you said last night and earlier.You have not proactively laid out a foreign policy doctrine yet. Why?SANDERS: Well, thats not quite accurate. I did give a speech at Georgetown where I talked about democratic socialism and foreign policy. Maybe I shouldnt have combined the two in the same speech, because the foreign policy part of it didnt get much attention. So, let me take this opportunity to give you a very short speech here on the issue.I think, while it is true that the secretary and I voted differently on the war in Iraq, what is important is that we learn the lesson of the war in Iraq. And that lesson is intrinsic to my foreign policy if elected president, is the United States cannot do it alone. We cannot be the policeman of the world. We are now spending more I believe than the next eight countries on defense. We have got to work in strong coalition with the major powers of the world and with those Muslim countries that are prepared to stand up and take on terrorism.So I would say that the key doctrine of the Sanders administration would be no, we cannot continue to do it alone; we need to work in coalition.(APPLAUSE)(CROSSTALK)CLINTON: A group of national security experts, military intelligence experts, issued a very concerning statement about Senator Sanderss views on foreign policy and national security, pointing out some of the comments he has made on these issues, such as inviting Iranian troops into Syria to try to resolve the conflict there; putting them right at the doorstep of Israel. Asking Saudi Arabia and Iran to work together, when they cant stand each other and are engaged in a proxy battle right at this moment.CLINTON: So I do think questions have been raised and questions have to be answered because when New Hampshire voters go on Tuesday to cast your vote, you are voting both for a president and a commander in chief. And there is no way to predict what comes in the door of that White House from day to day that can pose a threat to the United States or one of our friends and allies, and I think this is a big part of the job interview that we are all conducting with the voters here.TODD: All right, Senator, 30 seconds.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: (OFF-MIKE) I fully, fully concede that Secretary Clinton, who was secretary of State for four years, has more experience  hat is not arguable  in foreign affairs. But experience is not the only point, judgment is. And once again, back in 2002, when we both looked at the same evidence about the wisdom of the war in Iraq, one of us voted the right way and one of us didnt.In terms of Iran and in terms of Saudi Arabia, of course they hate each other. Thats no great secret. But John Kerry, who is I think doing a very good job, has tried to at least get these people in the room together because both of them are being threatened by ISIS.CLINTON: Well, let me just add that, you know, Ive said this before and Im very proud of it, that when it comes to judgment, having run a hard race against Senator Obama at the time, he turned to me to be secretary of State. And when it comes to the biggest counterterrorism issues that we faced in this administration, namely whether or not to go after bin Laden, I was at that table, I was exercising my judgment to advise the president on what to do, on that, on Iran, on Russia on China, on a whole raft of issues.Because I know from my own experience that youve got to be ready on day one. There is just too much unpredictable threat and danger in the world today, you know, to try to just say wait, Ill get to that when I can. That is just not an acceptable approach.SANDERS: Well...MADDOW: Secretary Clinton, at the  at the last Democratic debate in Charleston  I want to get specific here  Senator Sanders called for moving as aggressively as we can to normalize relations with Iran. Your campaign has criticized him for saying that. Now that hes standing next to you here on this stage, can you explain why the U.S. shouldnt try to normalize relations in Iran in your view?CLINTON: Absolutely. You know, I did put together the coalition to impose sanctions. I actually started the negotiations that led to the nuclear agreement, sending some much my closest aides to begin the conversations with the Iranians.Im very pleased we got that nuclear agreement. It puts a lid on the nuclear weapons program. We have to enforce it, there have to be consequences attached to it. But that is not our only problem with Iran. We have to figure out how to deal with Iran as the principal state sponsor of terrorism in the world.They are destabilizing governments in the region. They continue to support Hezbollah and Hamas in Lebanon against Israel. A lot of work that we have do is going to be incredibly hard. Im prepared to do that work, but I believe, just as I did with imposing the sanctions, you have to get action for action.If we were to normalize relations right now, we would remove one of the biggest pieces of leverage we have to try to influence and change Iranian behavior. The president doesnt think we should. I certainly dont think we should. I believe we have to take this step by step to try to reign in Iranian aggression, their support for terrorism and the other bad behavior that can come back and haunt us.SANDERS: Who said That think we should normalize relations with Iran tomorrow? I never said that. I think we should move forward as quickly as we can.And youre right. They are a sponsor of terrorism around the world and we have to address that. But you know, a number of years ago, people were saying normal relationship with Cuba, what a bad and silly idea. Theyre Communists, they are our enemy. Well guess what? Change has come.So please dont suggest that I think we normalize relations with Tehran tomorrow. We dont. But I would like to see us move forward, and hopefully some day that will happen. And I would say if I might, Madam Secretary  and you can correct me if Im wrong. When you ran against Senator Obama you thought him naive because he thought it was a good idea to talk to our enemies. I think those are exactly the people you have to talk to and you have to negotiate with.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: Well Senator, let me just correct the record if I can. You know  let me correct the record.(CROSSTALK)TODD: 30 seconds, madam secretary.CLINTON: As I  as I certainly recall, the question was to meet with without conditions. And youre right, I was against that. I was against it then I would be against it now.SANDERS: OK.CLINTON: Part of diplomacy, the hard work of diplomacy is trying to extract whatever concessions you can get, and giving something the other side wants. Of course youve got to try to make peace with, and work with those who are your adversaries, but you dont just rush in, open the door, and say, Here I am. Lets talk and make a deal.Thats not the way it works.SANDERS: I think President Obama had the right idea, and the bottom line is that of course there have to be conditions. But, of course it doesnt do us any good to not talk with our adversaries...CLINTON: ... Well, we set conditions on Iran. We worked hard to get them established, and to be enforced, and then we talked. Thats exactly the right...(CROSSTALK)CLINTON: ... And, thats what I did with the President, so he and I are on the very same page.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: Just to set the record straight, I very strongly supported the agreement which makes certain that Iran does not get a nuclear weapon.TODD: Alright, as Commander in Chief, Senator Sanders, youve got to prioritize potential threats to the United States. Three countries, North Korea, Iran, Russia. How would you rank them in order of their threat to Americas security right now...SANDERS: ... ISIS...TODD: ... Starting with the biggest threat.SANDERS: ISIS, you forgot one...TODD: ... I didnt say that...SANDERS: ... No, no...TODD: ... No...SANDERS: ... ISIS would be ...TODD: ... We already had that. Im talking about these three countries. How would you orient our national security, our national defense posture.SANDERS: Clearly North Korea is a very strange situation because it is such an isolated country run by a handful of dictators, or maybe just one, who seems to be somewhat paranoid. And, who had nuclear weapons.And, our goal there, in my view, is to work and lean strongly on China to put as much pressure. China is one of the few major countries in the world that has significant support for North Korea, and I think we got to do everything we can to put pressure on China. I worry very much about an isolated, paranoid country with atomic bombs.I think, clearly, we got to work closely with China to resolve the serious problems we have, and I worry about Putin and his military adventurism in the Crimea and the Ukraine.TODD: Secretary of Defense Ash Carter this week picked one of those three, and he has said Russia is, basically, the most important national security threat. Sort of reorienting the defense and the challenges to that. Do you agree with his decisions...SANDERS: ... No, I dont. I worry very, very much about an isolated country. Thats what makes me nervous. Russia lives in the world. China lives in the world. North Korea is a very, very strange country because it is so isolated, and I do feel that a nation with nuclear weapons, they have got to be dealt with. Dealt with effectively.TODD: Secretary Clinton, what do you think of Secretary of Defense Ash Carter. Hes basically putting Russia above Iran, above North Korea, as sort of the chief national security challenge right now.CLINTON: I havent talked to Secretary Carter, but heres what I would think hes planning. We do have the nuclear weapons agreement with Iran, thats an enforcement consequence, action for action, follow on. We have a plan, we will watch them, we will be vigilant.We do have to worry about North Korea. They continue to develop their nuclear weapons capability, and theyre working very hard on their ballistic missile capability.And, I know that some of those plans could very well lead to a missile that might reach Hawaii, if not the West Coast. We do have to try to get the countries in the region to work with us to do everything we can to confine, and constrain them.But, what Secretary Carter is looking at is the constant pressure that Russias putting on our European allies. The way that Russia is trying to move the boundaries of the post-World War II Europe. The way that he is trying to set European countries against one another, seizing territory, holding it in Crimea. Beginning to explore whether they could make some inroads in the Baltics.We know that they are deeply engaged in supporting Assad because they want to have a place in the Middle East. They have a naval base, they have an air base in Syria. They want to hang on to that. I think what Secretary Carter is seeing, and Im glad he is, is that we got to get NATO back working for the common defense. Weve got to do more to support our partners in NATO, and we have to send a very clear message to Putin that this kind of belligerence, that this kind of testing of boundaries will have to be responded to. The best way to do that is to put more armor in, put more money from the Europeans in so theyre actually contributing more to their own defense.TODD: Thank you both, Rachel?MADDOW: Secretary Clinton, I want to ask you about a national security issue that is closer to home. There are thousands of veterans, over 100,000 veterans living in the state of New Hampshire.If either one of you is nominated as the Democratic Partys nominee, you will likely face a Republican opponent in the general election who wants to privatize or even abolish big parts of the V.A. Its a newly popular idea in conservative politics.How will you win the argument on that issue given the problems that have been exposed at the V.A. in the last few years? Whats your argument that the V.A. should still exist and should not be privatized?CLINTON: Well, first of all, Im absolutely against privatizing the V.A. And I am going do everything I can to build on the reforms that Senator Sanders and others in Congress have passed to try to fix whats wrong with the V.A.There are a lot of issues about wait times and services that have to be fixed because our veterans deserve nothing but the best.But youre absolutely right, you know, Rachel, this is another part of the Koch brothers agenda. Theyve actually formed an organization to try to begin to convince Americans we should no longer have guaranteed health care, specialized care for our veterans.I will fight that as hard as I can. I think theres where we can enlist the veterans service organizations, the veterans of America, because, yes, lets fix the V.A., but we will never let it be privatized, and that is a promise.(APPLAUSE)MADDOW: Senator Sanders, you, as a congressional leader on veterans issues and the Veterans Committee, youve worked in a very bipartisan way with Senator John McCain and others on veterans issues. Is the right contour of the fight, the way shes talking about this issue?SANDERS: Let me agree. You know, as the secretary knows, I chaired  I had the privilege and the honor of chairing the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs. And it is interesting to me, you know, Republicans give a lot of speeches about how much they love veterans. I work with the American Legion, the VFW, the DAV, the Vietnam Vets, and virtually every veterans organization to put together the most comprehensive piece of the veterans legislation in the modern history of America. Thats what I did.And I brought it to the floor of the Senate. Every Democrat voted for it, I got two Republicans. We ended up with 56 votes and I couldnt get the 60 votes that I needed. That is pathetic.This was legislation supported by all of the veterans organizations, addressing many of the serious problems that veterans face in health care and in how we deliver benefits to them.So Republicans talk a good game about veterans, but when it came to put money on the line to protect our veterans, frankly, they were not there.What I did next, Rachel, is I had to retreat a little bit, I had to compromise. I did work with John McCain. I did work with Jeff Miller over in the House. And we put together not the bill that I wanted, but probably the most comprehensive V.A. health care bill in the modern history of this country.Secretary Clinton is absolutely right, there are people, Koch brothers among others, who have a group called Concerned Veterans of America, funded by the Koch brothers. The Koch brothers, by the way, want to destroy Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, every governmental program passed since the 1930s. Yes, there are people out there who want to privatize it.The last point that Id make. I had a hearing. I had all of the veterans groups in front of me. And I said to them, tell me when a veteran gets in to the V.A., understanding there are waiting lines and real problems, when a veteran gets into the system, is the quality of care good?Without exception, what they said, good, excellent, very good. Weve got to strengthen the V.A. We do not privatize the V.A.(APPLAUSE)MADDOW: Thank you, Senator.Senator Sanders, Secretary Clinton, were going to take another break. Well be talking about Social Security and some of those other issues when we come back.(APPLAUSE)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(APPLAUSE)TODD: And we are back. Were gonna get into a little bit of election politics, electability, in a little bit.Senator Sanders, The Iowa Democratic Party has declared Hillary Clinton the winner of Mondays Iowa caucuses  narrowest of margins. Today, the Des Moines Register has an editorial that calls for the audit of the results, saying, quote, what happened Monday night at the Democratic caucuses was a debacle, period. The results were too close not to do a complete audit.Senator Sanders, do you accept the idea that Hillary Clinton won Iowa? And do you  or do you believe the caucuses are still an open question?SANDERS: Well, I agree with the Des Moines Register, but lets not blow this out of proportion. This is not a  this is not, like, a winner-take-all thing.I think where we now stand  correct me if Im wrong  you have 22 delegates, I have 20 delegates. We need 2,500 delegates to win the nomination.(LAUGHTER)You know, so this is not  this is not the biggest deal in the world. We think, by the way, based on talking to our precinct captains, we may have at least two more delegates.What the Des Moines Register said  you know, there were coin  I think there were half a dozen coin flips  a fairly chaotic type situation. At the end of the day, no matter how its recounted, it will break roughly even.And by the way, I love and respect the caucus process in Iowa. See, and I dont have to say it, because they voted already.(LAUGHTER)And I love New Hampshire, too, because you havent voted, but...(APPLAUSE)... but, look, I think people are blowing this up out of proportion. But I think we need improvements in the process by which results are determined.TODD: Secretary Clinton, will you participate in some sort of audit, if thats what the party wants to do? You good with that?CLINTON: Whatever they decide to do, thats fine.TODD: Thats fair enough. OK.CLINTON: All right.TODD: Good, we move on. Were happy with that. We have more questions.MADDOW: Senator  Senator Sanders, in 1964...SANDERS: Oh (inaudible).(LAUGHTER)See, when you are old, then they go back all these years. All right. What have you got?MADDOW: In 1964, I heard that the Republicans nominated Barry Goldwater, who was the hero of the conservative movement. He was, however, far to the right of most of that party. In 1972, the Democrats nominated George McGovern, who was a hero of liberals in the antiwar movement, but he was to the left of his partys mainstream.Both of those nominees made activists very excited, and they both got destroyed in the general election. Even Democrats who love you worry about your fate in a general election. And I know you have good head-to-head polling numbers against Republican frontrunners right now. We know that. But do you have a general election strategy that is different than the way youre running right now to try to get the nomination?SANDERS: Well, you know, a general election is different than a primary and caucus process. But let me just say this. In terms of where we are right now, as you mention, Rachel, in a number of national and state, including New Hampshire. For example, the last poll I saw  there may have been a new one  last one I saw here in New Hampshire, a battleground state, had me defeating Trump by 19; the secretary defeating him by one. There were also pretty large margins in Iowa and Wisconsin.These are polls. Polls go up. Polls go down. But heres why I think I will be, if nominated, the strongest candidate. Democrats win when there is a large voter turnout; when people are excited; when working people, middle class people and young people are prepared to engage in the political process.Republicans win when people are demoralized and you have a small voter turnout, which by the way is why they love voter suppression. I believe that our campaign up to now has shown that we can create an enormous amount of enthusiasm from working people, from young people, who will get involved in the political process and which will drive us to a very large voter turnout.If there is a large voter turnout, not only do we retain the White House, but I think we regain the Senate. We win governors chairs up and down the line. So I believe if you want to retain the White House, if you want to see Democrats do well across the board, I think our campaign is the one that creates the large voter turnout and helps us win.(APPLAUSE)MADDOW: Secretary Clinton, your campaign surrogates, and people who have endorsed you, have suggested that or even said that if Senator Sanders is the nominee, that Democrats will suffer nationwide and the chances will go down of Democrats holding onto the White House. With him here standing next to you, can you tell us whether or not you believe he would win the general election if he were nominated?CLINTON: I can only tell you what I believe, and that is that I am the strongest candidate to take it to the Republicans and win in November.(APPLAUSE)And I say that with great  with great respect for the campaign that Senator Sanders has been running. I personally am thrilled at the numbers of people, and particularly young people who are coming to support your campaign. I hope that I will be able to earn their support. They may not support me now, but I support them and well work together.But what Im concerned about is the views of many Democrats who know their states, who know how hard it is to win a general election. And it also will push whoever the nominee is into the spotlight. Ive been vetted. Theres hardly anything you dont know about me. And I think its fair to say that whoever is in that position, Senator Sanders or anyone else who might have run, will face the most withering onslaught.So, I think that I am the person who can do all aspects of the job. I think Im the person best prepared to take the case to the Republicans. And I think that at the end of the day, its not so much electability. It is who the American people can believe can keep them safe, can get the economy moving again, can get incomes rising, can build on the progressive accomplishments of President Obama.And I think that the coalition that President Obama put together to win twice is a coalition that I can put together and add to. And thats what Im prepared to...(APPLAUSE)(CROSSTALK)TODD: Well stay on this issue. Well stay on this topic.TODD: Secretary Clinton, just like there are some Democrats that question Senator Sanders ability in the general election, many Democratic voters that our reporters have been running into in Iowa and New Hampshire, they tell our reporters over and over again theyre worried about the emails issue, not because they dont believe your explanation, but because its a drip-drip, because the cloud is hanging over your head and that it will impact the general election.They see your numbers right now and they think its the email issue as to why youre not polling very well. So can you reassure these Democrats that somehow the email issue isnt going to blow up your candidacy if youre the nominee?CLINTON: Absolutely I can. You know, before it was emails, it was Benghazi, and the Republicans were stirring up so much controversy about that. And I testified for 11 hours, answered their questions. They basically said yeah, didnt get her. We tried. That was all a political ploy.Now, we had a development in the email matter today when it came out that Secretary Powell and close aides to Former Secretary Rice used private e-mail accounts. and now you have these people in the government who are doing the same thing to Secretary Powell and Secretary Rices aide theyve been doing to me, which is that I never sent or received any classified material. They are retroactively classifying it.I agree completely with Secretary Powell, who said today this is an absurdity. And so I think the American people will know its an absurdity. I have absolutely no concerns about it whatsoever.(APPLAUSE)TODD: All right, Madam Secretary, there is an open  there is an open FBI investigation into this matter about how you may have handled classified material. Are you 100 percent confident that nothing is going to come of this FBI investigation?CLINTON: I am 100 percent confident. This is a security review that was requested. It is being carried out. It will be resolved. But I have to add if theres going to be a security review about me, theres going to have to be security reviews about a lot of other people, including Republican office holders, because weve got this absurd situation of retroactive classifications.Honest to goodness, this is  this just beggars the imagination. So I have absolutely no concerns about it, but weve got to get to the bottom of whats really going on here, and I hope that will happen.TODD: Well, Senator sanders, you famously at the first debate said you didnt give a darn about her emails; I think you used another (inaudible).SANDERS: (OFF-MIKE)TODD: Youre right. Im trying to  its a  its a family hour still right now. After 11:00, Ill say it the other way. And you mostly have refrained from commenting on it, but recently you called it a very serious issue, and then the other day you said well shes getting slapped with the email controversy.Are you  how are you feeling about these darn emails now?SANDERS: I am feeling exactly the way I felt at the first debate. Theres a process under way. I will not politicize it.TODD: OK. Senator Sanders, thank you.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: And by the way  and by the way, if I may, the secretary probably doesnt know that theres not a day that goes by when I am not asked to attack her on that issue, and I have refrained from doing that and I will continue to refrain from doing that.(APPLAUSE)MADDOW: Senator Sanders, thank you. Senator, in December, one of your campaign staffers was fired from your campaign for taking voter data essentially from the Clinton campaign. You apologized for that when the incident was made public.Your campaign has now been criticized for its operatives essentially impersonating culinary union members wearing union pins in Nevada, and the Nashua Telegraph has complained recently that you falsely implied in an advertisement that they had endorsed you when they did not.None of these issues obviously is the end of the world, but they all are of a piece. Are you in some sense losing control of your campaign?SANDERS: Not losing control of our campaign. You know, we have hired a whole lot of people in a rapid way and I am familiar with the first two instances and they are unacceptable, and we have apologized and dealt with that.In terms of the last one, as I understand it, we did not suggest that we had the endorsement of a newspaper. Newspapers who make endorsements also say positive things about other candidates, and to the best of my knowledge, that is what we did. So we never said, never said that somebody, a newspaper endorsed us that did not. What we did say is blah blah blah blah was said by the newspaper.MADDOW: Just to follow up on that, the title of the ad in question was Endorsement.SANDERS: But that was only for  that was not to be on television. Thats an important point. That was just something  as the secretary knows, you put titles on ads and you send them out, but there was no word in that ad, none, that said that those newspapers had endorsed us.MADDOW: Secretary Clinton, do you want 30 seconds on that issue? CLINTON: No.MADDOW: And with that, we will (inaudible).(APPLAUSE)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MADDOW: Welcome back to the University of New Hampshire, and the Democratic candidates debate.Secretary Clinton, on the issue of the death penalty, here in New Hampshire, the one person who is on death row is there for killing a police officer. Its a crime that has caused anguish in this state, both among death penalty opponents and death penalty supporters.The last time I had the chance to talk with you on this issue, on the death penalty, you said that capital punishment has a place in a very few federal cases, but you also said you would breathe a sigh of relief if the Supreme Court abolished the death penalty nationwide. Tonight, do you still support capital punishment, even if you do so reluctantly?CLINTON: Yes, I do. And  you know, what I hope the Supreme Court will do is make it absolutely clear that any state that continues capital punishment either must meet the highest standards of evidentiary (ph) proof of effective assistance of counsel or they cannot continue it because that, to me, is the real dividing line.I have much more confidence in the federal system, and I do reserve it for particularly heinous crimes in the federal system, like terrorism. I have strong feelings about that. I thought it was appropriate after a very thorough trial that Timothy McVeigh received the death penalty for blowing up the Federal Building in Oklahoma City, killing 168 people, including 19 children in a daycare center.I do for very limited, particularly heinous crimes believe it is an appropriate punishment, but I deeply disagree with the way that too many states are still implementing it. If it were possible to separate the federal from the state system by the Supreme Court, that would, I think, be an appropriate outcome.MADDOW: Senator Sanders, you have singled out the death penalty, and Senator Clintons support for the death penalty, as an issue that makes it hard to consider as progressive in your mind...SANDERS: ... Look, I hear what the Secretary said, and I understand, but look, there are  all of us know that we have seen in recent years horrible, horrible crimes. Its hard to imagine how people can do, bomb, and kill 168 people in Oklahoma City, or do the Boston Marathon bombing, but this is what I believe, and for a couple of reasons.Number one, too many innocent people, including minorities, African Americans, have been executed when they were not guilty. Thats number one. We have to be very careful about making sure about that.But, second of all, and maybe, in a deeper reason, of course there are barbaric acts out there. But, in a world of so much violence and killing, I just dont believe that government itself should be part of the killing. So, when somebody commits...(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: ... Somebody commits any of these terrible crimes that we have seen, you lock them up, and you toss away the key. Theyre never going to get out. But, I just dont want to see government be part of killing. Thats all. (APPLAUSE)MADDOW: Another issue related to the proper role of government, and in this case, specifically the role of government between the federal government and the states. I want to talk for a moment about the issue of Flint, Michigan. On the Flint lead poisoning disaster, you have both been highly critical of Governor Rick Snyder of Michigan, and how the state in Michigan both caused the lead poisoning problem, and has not acted fast enough to fix it. You have both been outspoken on that.The fact is that Michigan though has not fixed it. There is no door to door delivery of clean water in Flint even today. Not a single lead pipe has been replaced in Flint, even today. If the state is failing, would you, Secretary Clinton, would you as President order a federal response to get it right over and above the wishes of the state?CLINTON: Absolutely. Absolutely. You know, Rachel, you and I have talked about this before. I thank you for going to Flint to hold that town hall. I will be in Flint at the Mayors invitation on Sunday to get an in depth briefing about what is, and is not happening.This is an emergency. Everyday that goes by that these people, particularly the children, are not tested so we can know what steps must be taken to try to remediate the effects of the poisoning that they have been living with is a day lost in a childs life. I know from the work that Ive done over so many years, lead, the toxic nature of lead can affect you brain development, your body development, your behavior.I absolutely believe that what is being done is not sufficient. We need to be absolutely clear about everything that should be done from today to tomorrow, into the future to try to remedy the terrible burden that the people of Flint are barring. That includes fixing their pipes, it includes guaranteeing whatever healthcare and educational embellishments they may need going forward, and I think the federal government has way where it can bill the state of Michigan. If Michigan wont do it, there have to be ways that we can begin to move, and then make them pay for it, and hold them accountable.(APPLAUSE)MADDOW: Senator Sanders are there things the President could be doing? President Obama could be ordering, done, right now, in Flint, Michigan that are not being done that you as President would do?SANDERS: Absolutely. I think the Secretary described the situation appropriately.SANDERS: You know, I dont go around asking for governors resignations every day. In fact, I think I never have in my life. But I did ask for the resignation of Governor Snyder because his irresponsibility...(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: ... was so outrageous.What we are talking about are children being poisoned. Thats what were talking about. We dont know, no one knows for sure because they havent done the appropriate studies, but theres no question that kids intellectual development may have been impacted. We dont know how many thousands.The idea that there has not been a dramatic response is beyond comprehension. And when you have one of the, I think, significant public health crises of recent years, of course the federal government comes in.And of course the federal government says, youre not going to be poisoning little kids and impacting their entire lives.Last point on this. And I suspect the secretary agrees. One wonders if this were a white suburban community what kind of response there would have been.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: Flint, Michigan, is a poor community. It is disproportionately African-American and minority. And what has happened there is absolutely unacceptable.MADDOW: Senator, thank you.TODD: Secretary Clinton, let me turn to the issue of trade. In the 90s you supported NAFTA. But you opposed it when you ran for the president in 2008. As secretary of state, you supported TPP, and then  which, of course, is that trade agreement with a lot of Asian countries, but you now oppose it as you make your second bid for president.If elected, should Democrats expect that once youre in office you will then become supportive of these trade agreements again?CLINTON: You know, Chuck, Ive only had responsibility for voting for trade agreements as a senator. And I voted a multinational trade agreement when I was senator, the CAFTA agreement, because I did not believe it was in the best interests of the workers of America, of our incomes, and I opposed it.I did hope that the TPP, negotiated by this administration, would put to rest a lot of the concerns that many people have expressed about trade agreements. And I said that I was holding out that hope that it would be the kind of trade agreement that I was looking for.I waited until it had actually been negotiated because I did want to give the benefit of the doubt to the administration. Once I saw what the outcome was, I opposed it.Now I have a very clear view about this. We have to trade with the rest of the world. We are 5 percent of the worlds population. We have to trade with the other 95 percent. And trade has to be reciprocal. Thats the way the global economy works.But we have failed to provide the basic safety net support that American workers need in order to be able to compete and win in the global economy. So its not just whats in the trade agreement that Im interested in.I did help to renegotiate the trade agreement that we inherited from President Bush with Korea. We go the UAW on board because of changes we made. So there are changes that I believe would make a real difference if they could be achieved, but I do not currently support it as it is written.TODD: Well, Senator Sanders, I know you want to respond on this, you have never supported a trade deal since youve been in Congress.SANDERS: Absolutely right.TODD: But if you do that as president...(APPLAUSE)TODD: If you do that as president, how are you not essentially letting China, who will do all of these deals around the world, how are you going to prevent China from essentially setting the rules of trade for the world?SANDERS: Chuck, I believe in trade, but I do not believe in unfettered free trade. I believe in fair trade which works for the middle class and working families of this country and not just large multinational corporations.I was not only in opposition to NAFTA  and this is an area where the secretary and I have disagreements. I was not only in opposition to NAFTA, I was on the picket line in opposition to NAFTA because I understood  I dont think this is really rocket science.We heard all of the people tell us how many great jobs would be created. I didnt believe that for a second because I understood what the function of NAFTA, CAFTA, PNTR with China, and the TPP is, its to say to American workers, hey, you are now competing against people in Vietnam who make 56 cents an hour minimum wage.I dont want American workers to compete against people making 56 cents an hour. I dont want companies shutting down in America, throwing people out on the street, moving to China, and bringing their products back into this country.SANDERS: So, do I believe in trade? Of course, I believe in trade. But the current trade agreements over the last 30 years were written by corporate America, for corporate America, resulted in the loss of millions of decent-paying jobs,60,000 factories in America lost since 2001, millions of decent-paying jobs; and also a downward spiral, a race to the bottom where employers say, Hey, you dont want to take a cut in pay? Were going to China.Workers today are working longer hours for lower wages. Trade is one of the reasons for that.(APPLAUSE)TODD: All right. Thank you both.Were going to sneak in one more break here, and when we come back well squeeze as many questions as we can before we end this thing. Well be right back.(APPLAUSE)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(APPLAUSE)TODD: All right. Welcome back here in the final minutes.MADDOW: The home stretch.TODD: The home stretch of this only Democratic debate in the final week before the primary.Let me start with you, Secretary Clinton, on this question. Obviously, President Obama got a lot of ambitious stuff done in his first year and a half. Youre going to have to make choices. And theres a lot of heavy lifts. And he made choices. He did healthcare and it came at the expense, arguably, of immigration reform. Had he put immigration reform first, perhaps that gets done and healthcare doesnt.TODD: So there are three big lifts that youve talked about: immigration, gun reform, climate change. What do you do first? Because you know the first one is the one you have the best shot at getting done.CLINTON: Well, I  I dont accept that premise, Chuck. I think that weve got so much business we have to do. Weve talked a lot tonight about what were against  were against income inequality. Were against the abuses of powerful interests. Were against a lot of things.Im for a lot of things. I dont want to just stop bad things from happening, I want to start good things from happening. And I believe, if Im so fortunate to get the nomination, I will begin to work immediately on putting together an agenda, beginning to talk with members of Congress and others about how we can push forward.I want to have half a billion more solar panels deployed, the first four years.(APPLAUSE)I want to have enough clean energy to power every home the next four years. I want us to keep working on the Affordable Care Act, to get not only to 100 percent coverage, but bring down the costs of prescription drugs and out-of-pocket costs.I want to move forward on paid family leave, on early childhood education, I want us to do more for small businesses.(APPLAUSE)Small businesses have to create most of the jobs, and were not creating and growing small businesses. I think, if you have a smart agenda, you pick the committees that you know have to begin to work on these various pieces  because thats the way Congress is set up. You go through different committees, and you really make a big push in the beginning.Immigration reform, economic revitalization with manufacturing, with infrastructure  we put it out there, and we begin to work on an ambitious, big, bold agenda that will actually produce the results that I want to see for our country.TODD: All right, but Senator Sanders...(APPLAUSE)... youve still got to do something first. As you know, history said  shows what you pick first is your best shot at getting, and how you prioritize things.SANDERS: No, let...TODD: Immigration reform, for instance, fell by the wayside in the first term because of this.SANDERS: ... I am absolutely supportive of comprehensive immigration reform and a path towards citizenship for 11 million people today who are living in the shadows. All right? We got to do that.(APPLAUSE)But you miss  when you looked at the issues, you missed two of the most important. And that is youre not going to accomplish what has to be done for working families and the middle class unless there is campaign finance reform.(APPLAUSE)So long as big money interests control the United States Congress, it is gonna be very hard to do what has to be done for working families. So let me be very clear. No nominee of mine, if Im elected president, to the United States Supreme Court will get that nomination unless he or she is loud and clear, and says they will vote to overturn Citizens United.(APPLAUSE)Second point  second point is that the only way we make change in terms of health care, in terms of dealing with a broken criminal justice system which, today, allows us to have more people in jail than any other country  largely African-American and Latino  the only way we create millions of jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure or have a tax system that says to the wealthy that they are going to pay their fair share, is when millions of people become involved in the political process.No, you just cant negotiate with Mitch McConnell. Mitch is gonna have to look out the window and see a whole lot of people saying, Mitch, stop representing the billionaire class. Start listening to working families.And as president, thats what I will work hard on.(APPLAUSE)TODD: OK. Thank you.MADDOW: Secretary Clinton, Republicans, particularly in campaign years, often talk about which departments of government  which agencies of government they would get rid of if they were elected president. The EPA, the Department of Education, the Commerce Department, oops  is  is there a department of government that you would get rid of? Or is there a whole new one that you would create?CLINTON: The answer to both of those is no. Im interested in making what we have work better. I want to streamline programs that are duplicative and redundant. I want to have a top-to-bottom review about what works and what doesnt work, and be absolutely clear were getting rid of what doesnt work.I have had the opportunity to run a big agency. I was very flattered when Henry Kissinger said I ran the State Department better  better than anybody had run it in a long time. So I have an idea of what its going to take to make our government work more efficiently.And when you put together a budget, you have to make a lot of hard decisions, but I think its not appropriate to say Im going to get rid of this, get rid of that until you have a very good process that gives you the information about what to do. CLINTON: But I want to add something else, you know, because look, we have so much work to do in our country, and I think its the greatest work that Americans will be called to do. And of course, we have to have people in every community involved in it. We have to have the political voice, the political grassroots speaking up and speaking out about what we have to try to accomplish in Washington.But we also need to have a very clear set of goals that we are going to achieve, and we need to level with the American people about what they are, what they will cost, what will be expected of our citizenry. So I see as president having a constant dialogue with Americans heres what were trying to get done, heres why I need your help, heres why you may think comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship isnt something you care about, but Im telling you it will help fix the labor market, it will bring people out of the shadows MADDOW: Thank you, Secretary Clinton.CLINTON:  it will actually raise wages. You have to make all those connections so that youve got people with you every step of the way. Thats what I want to do.MADDOW: Thank you very much. Thank you.(APPLAUSE)TODD: All right, before we go, I want to ask each one of these. Secretary Clinton, youve made it clear when you look at Senator Sanders, you do not see a president, but do you see CLINTON: I never said that.TODD: But do you see  do you see a vice president?(LAUGHTER)CLINTON: Look TODD: Would you unite the party by trying to pick Senator Sanders as your running mate?CLINTON: Well, Im certainly going to unite the party, but Im not  Im not getting ahead of myself. I think that would be a little bit presumptuous. If Im so fortunate as to be the nominee, the first person I will call to talk to about where we go and how we get it done will be Senator Sanders.(APPLAUSE)TODD: Senator, would you consider the secretary?SANDERS: I agree with what the secretary said. We shouldnt be getting ahead of ourselves. And as I have said many times, you know, sometimes in these campaigns, things get a little bit out of hand. I happen to respect the secretary very much, I hope its mutual. And on our worst days, I think it is fair to say we are 100 times better than any Republican candidate.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: Thats true. Thats true.(CROSSTALK)TODD: Secretary Clinton, closing statements. You are first.CLINTON: Well first, thanks to MSNBC and thanks to all of you for holding this debate before the New Hampshire primary. I am going to campaign as hard as I can between now and Tuesday to earn your votes in that primary, and I hear some talk that people are trying to decide do they vote with their heart, do they vote with their head, Im asking you to bring both your heart and your head to vote with you on Tuesday because we have a lot of work that can only come because your heart is moved.You know, we didnt get to talk about the continuing struggles that Americans face with racism, with sexism, with discrimination against the LGBT community, with new Americans, with people with disabilities. Yes, we have income inequality, we have other forms of inequality that we need to stand up against and absolutely diminish from our society.So I have been moved by my heart ever since I was a young woman about the age of a lot of Senator Sanders supporters worrying what I can do to make a difference for my country, and I will bring that heart with me, but I will also tell you weve got to get our heads together to come up with the best answers to solve the problems so that people can have real differences in their lives that will make them better for now and into the future.(APPLAUSE)TODD: Thank you, Madam Secretary. Senator Sanders.SANDERS: I  my dad came to this country at the age of 17 from Poland. Didnt have any money, couldnt speak English, he died pretty young, and I think it would have been beyond his wildest dreams to see his son up here on this stage today running for president.I love this country and my dad loved this country, and he was the most proud American because of what it gave him in terms of raising his family, even though we never had much money. But today in America, we are the only major country on earth that doesnt guarantee health care to all people, that doesnt guarantee paid family and medical leave. We have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major country on earth. We are seeing millions of families unable to send their kids to college in the United States of America.Im running for president because I believe it is just too late for establishment politics and establishment economics. I do believe we need a political revolution where millions of people stand up and say loudly and clearly that our government belongs to all of us and not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors.Thank you all.(APPLAUSE)TODD: Well, there you have it. I promise you, Rachel and I have a lot more questions, but we just dont have any more time, unless we could (inaudible) a third hour, but I dont think so.Our debate coverage  (inaudible) debate coverage will continue in just a moment with our colleague (inaudible).And we want to thank all of you for being here, and we want to thank the two candidates for taking part in this important event.MADDOW: We also want to thank our host, the University of New Hampshire," and the people of New Hampshire. You guys get to vote in just five days. I cant wait to see how it turns out. Dont screw up.TODD: Well see you in a few minutes. Thank you.MADDOW: Thank you.(APPLAUSE)END""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
24,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/07/us/politics/transcript-of-the-republican-presidential-debate-in-new-hampshire.html,2/7/16,"Following is a transcript of the Republican debate, as transcribed by the Federal News Service.MUIR: Good evening, again, everyone. This is the first time since Iowa and the only time before the New Hampshire primary that the Republican candidates will have the opportunity to face each other.MUIR: The people of Iowa have been heard. Now its New Hampshires turn. In just three days, voters here will decide who they think should be the Republican nominee for president.RADDATZ: Questions of leadership and character have dominated the news ever since the Iowa caucuses a few days ago. Here with us to question the candidates this evening are Josh McElveen from WMUR here in Manchester and author and commentator Mary Katherine Ham.MUIR: So lets welcome the candidates for the Republican nomination for president.New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.(APPLAUSE)RADDATZ: Dr. Ben Carson.(APPLAUSE)MUIR: Texas Senator Ted Cruz.(APPLAUSE)RADDATZ: Businessman Donald Trump.(APPLAUSE)MUIR: Florida Senator Marco Rubio.(APPLAUSE)RADDATZ: Former Florida Governor, Jeb Bush.(APPLAUSE)MUIR: And Ohio Governor John Kasich.(APPLAUSE)RADDATZ: Ladies and gentlemen, the Republican candidates.(APPLAUSE)MUIR: And Dr. Ben Carson, please come out on the stage. Hes standing there, as well. Dr. Carson.(APPLAUSE)RADDATZ: And Donald Trump.(APPLAUSE)MUIR: And lastly, we welcome back to the debate stage, Donald Trump.(APPLAUSE)RUBIO (?): What about Kasich? Can I introduce Kasich?MUIR: It was so noisy in here. Yes. Yes. Were going to introduce Ohio Governor John kasich.(APPLAUSE)MUIR: The applause so loud here in the hall.RADDATZ: The applause so loud you couldnt hear. We couldnt hear, either. Thats a good sign for the excitement this evening.Gentlemen, thank you for being here tonight, just days before voters here in New Hampshire make their decisions. The rules are simple and have been agreed to by all the campaigns. There will be 60 seconds to answer and if another candidate is mentioned in that answer, that candidate will have 30 seconds to respond. There are green, yellow and red lights that each candidate will see to signal when time is up and they will also hear this sound.MUIR: So lets get started. We welcome you all to the debate stage here tonight. Were going to tackle the issues Americans are most concerned about, the economy, ISIS, Homeland Security. And here in New Hampshire, some of the most heated rhetoric yet over who is best suited to step in on day one, who has the experience, who has the temperament to be commander-in-chief.Mr. Trump, Senator Cruz has said about you right here in New Hampshire this week, quote, I dont know anyone who would be comfortable with someone who behaves this way, having his finger on the button. Were liable to wake up one morning, and if he were president, he would nuke Denmark. Saying, quote, Thats temperament of a leader to keep this country safe.I wanted to give you the opportunity to respond to this and to tell the American people tonight why you do have the temperament to be commander-in-chief.TRUMP: I actually think I have the best temperament. I built a massive corporation. I employ thousands and thousands of people. Ive gotten along with people for years and years, have tremendous relationships with many people, including politicians on both sides. And no matter how you cut it, when I  when I came out, I hit immigration, I hit it very hard. Everybody said, Oh, the temperament, because I talked about illegal immigration.TRUMP: Now, everybodys coming to me, theyre all trying to say, well, hes right, we have to come to him. I hit other things. I talked about Muslims. We have a problem. Nobody else wanted to mention the problem, I brought it up. I took a lot of heat. We have to have a temporary something, because theres something going on thats not good. And remember this, Im the only one up here, when the war of Iraq  in Iraq, I was the one that said, Dont go, dont do it, youre going to destabilize the Middle East. So, Im not one with a trigger. Im not one with a trigger. Other people up here, believe me, would be a lot faster.But Ill build the mill arbitrary stronger, bigger, better than anybody up here, and nobody is going to mess with us. That, I can tell you.(APPLAUSE)MUIR: Mr. Trump, thank you. I want to bring this to Senator Cruz, then.Because Senator, you did said of Trumps behavior this week, thats not the temperament of a leader to keep this country safe.Why not?CRUZ: Well, you know, David, the assessment the voters are making here in New Hampshire and across the country is they are evaluating each and every one of us. They are looking to our experience. They are looking to our knowledge. They are looking to our temperament and judgment. They are looking to our clarity of vision and our strength of resolve.The world is getting much more dangerous. Weve had seven years with Barack Obama in the oval office, a commander-in-chief that is unwilling even to acknowledge the enemy were facing. This is a president who, in the wake of Paris, in the wake of San Bernardino, will not even use the words radical Islamic terrorism, much less focus on defeating the enemy.I am convinced every individual standing on this stage, would make a much better commander-in-chief than Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders.(APPLAUSE)And the primary voters are making the assessment for each of us, who is best prepared to keep this country safe, to rebuild the military, to rebuild our Navy, our Air Force, our Army, our Marines, and to ensure that we keep America safe.MUIR: Senator Cruz, I did ask about Mr. Trump. You said he doesnt have the temperament to be commander-in-chief. Do you stand by those words?CRUZ: I think that is an assessment the voters are going to make. And they are going to make it of each and everyone of us. They are going to assess who is level-headed, who has clear vision, who has judgment, who can confront our enemies, who can confront the threats we face in this country, and who can have the judgment when to engage and when not to engage  both are incredibly important for a commander-in-chief, knowing how to go after our enemies.In the case of Iran, for example, who has the clarity of vision to understand that the Ayatollah Khamenei, when he chants, Death to America, he means it. We need a president with the judgment and resolve to keep this country safe from radical Islamic terrorists.MUIR: Senator Cruz, thank you. Were going to continue on this notion of readiness and experience. Im going to come back.TRUMP: Am I allowed to respond? I have to respond.MUIR: If you would like to respond, Mr. Trump.TRUMP: First of all, I respect what Ted just said, but if you noticed, he didnt answer your question. And thats whats going to happen  OK.(APPLAUSE)Thats whats going to happen with our enemies and the people we compete against. Were going to win with Trump. Were going to win. We dont win anymore. Our country doesnt win anymore. Were going to win with Trump. And people back down with Trump. And thats what I like and thats what the country is going to like.(APPLAUSE)MUIR: Mr. Trump, thank you. And were going to continue on this notion of readiness and on experience, but I want to ask about a headline that was back in the papers again this morning.Dr. Carson, on the day of the Iowa caucuses, the Cruz campaign sent out messages and voicemails saying, quote, Breaking news. Dr. Ben Carson will be planning to suspend his campaign following tonights caucuses. Please inform any Carson caucus-goers of this news.But as we can all see, you are still standing here tonight. Late this week, your campaign sent this e-mail, quote, This kind of deceitful behavior is why the American people dont trust politicians. If Senator Cruz does not act, then he clearly represents D.C. values.What kind of action do you think Senator Cruz should take?CARSON: Well, you know, when I wasnt introduced No. 2, as was the plan, I thought maybe he thought I already had dropped out. But...(APPLAUSE)But you know, today is the 105th anniversary, or  105th birthday of Ronald Reagan. His 11 Commandment was not to speak ill of another Republican. So, Im not going to use this opportunity to savage the reputation of Senator Cruz.(APPLAUSE)But I will say  I will say  I will say that I was very disappointed that members of his team thought so little of me that they thought that after having hundreds, if not thousands of volunteers and college students who sacrificed their time and were dedicated to the cause  one even died  to think that I would just walk away ten minutes before the caucus and say, Forget about you guys.CARSON: I mean, who would do something like that? Now, I dont think anyone on this stage would do something like that. And to assume that someone would, what does that tell you? So, unfortunately, it did happen.It gives us a very good example of certain types of Washington ethics. Washington ethics. Washington ethics basically says, if its legal, you do what you need to do in order to win. Thats not my ethics. My ethics is, you do whats right.MUIR: Senator Cruz.(APPLAUSE)MUIR: Dr. Carson, thank you.Senator Cruz, you have said that Dr. Carson and his wife have become friends of yours. Im curious as why you didnt call ahead of time to either the doctor or his wife or have your campaign check in with the other campaign before sending out those messages.CRUZ: Ben is a good and honorable man and Ben and Candy have become friends. He has an amazing life story that has inspired millions, including me. When this transpired, I apologized to him then and I do so now. Ben, Im sorry.Let me tell you the facts of what occurred for those who are interested in knowing. On Monday night, about 6:30 p.m., CNN reported that Ben was not going from Iowa to New Hampshire or South Carolina. Rather, he was, quote, Taking a break from campaigning.They reported that on television, CNNs political anchors, Jake Tapper and Dana Bash and Wolf Blitzer, said it was highly unusual and highly significant. My political team saw CNNs report breaking news and they forwarded that news to our volunteers, it was being covered on live television.Now, at the time, I was at the caucuses, I was getting ready to speak at the caucuses just like Ben was, just like everyone else was. I knew nothing about this. A couple hours later, I found out about it. I was told that Ben was unhappy. I called him that evening because I respect him very, very highly. I didnt reach him that evening.(BELL RINGS)I reached him the next day and apologized. He asked me then, he said, Ted, would you make this apologize in public? I said, yes, I will. And I did so. I regret that subsequently, CNN reported on that  they didnt correct that story until 9:15 that night. So from 6:30 p.m. to 9:15, thats what CNN was reporting.Subsequent to that initial report, Bens campaign put out a statement saying that he was not suspending his campaign. I wish that our campaign staff had forwarded that statement. They were unaware of it, I wish that they had, thats why I apologized.MUIR: Senator Cruz, thank you.Were going to move on here. Back to the issues...CARSON: Since I was mentioned...MUIR: Dr. Carson, please.CARSON: This is great you guys. I want you all to mention me when you say something.(LAUGHTER)In fact, the time line indicates that initial tweet from CNN was followed by another one within one minute that clarified that I was not dropping out. So, what happened to that one, it is unclear. But the bottom line is, we can see what happened, everybody can see what happened and you can make your own judgment.MUIR: Dr. Carson, thank you. Thank you, doctor.Senator Rubio. I want to stay on the issue of readiness to be president and experience and questions about you being a first-term senator.Governor Christie warning voters here in New Hampshire against voting for another first-term senator as America did with Barack Obama in 2008. Arguing that you are, quote,  not ready to be president of the United States.And Senator Santorum, who we all know, dropped out of the race and endorsed you, had a hard time when asked on national television, listing your accomplishments as senator. Tonight, what are your accomplishments in the Senate that demonstrate you are ready to be president of the United States?RUBIO: Well, let me say, from protecting the people of Florida from imminent domain abuse, to bringing accountability to the V.A., to the Girls Count Act, to sanctioning groups, Im proud of my service in the United States Senate and before that, in the Florida legislature.I will say, if politics becomes and the presidency becomes about electing people who have been Congress or in the Senate the longest, we should all rally around Joe Biden. Hes been around 1,000 years. Hes passed hundreds of bills and I dont think any of us believe Joe Biden should be president of the United States.And lets dispel once and for all with this fiction that Barack Obama doesnt know what hes doing. He knows exactly what hes doing. Barack Obama is undertaking a systematic effort to change this country, to make America more like the rest of the world.Thats why he passed Obamacare and the stimulus and Dodd-Frank and the deal with Iran. It is a systematic effort to change America. When Im president of the United States, we are going to re-embrace all the things that made America the greatest nation in the world and we are going to leave our children with what they deserve: the single greatest nation in the history of the world.MUIR: Senator Rubio, thank you.(APPLAUSE)MUIR: I do want to ask Governor Christie, Governor Christie, you said fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me when it comes to electing a first-term senator. You heard Senator Rubio make the case that he does have the experience. Your response?CHRISTIE: Sure. First, lets remember something. Every morning when a United States senator wakes up, they think about what kind of speech can I give or what kind of bill can I drop? Every morning, when I wake up, I think about what kind of problem do I need to solve for the people who actually elected me?Its a different experience, its a much different experience. And the fact is, Marco, you shouldnt compare yourself to Joe Biden and you shouldnt say that thats what were doing. Here is exactly what were doing.You have not be involved in a consequential decision where you had to be held accountable. You just simply havent.(APPLAUSE)And the fact is  the fact when you talk about the Hezbollah Sanctions Act that you list as one of your accomplishments you just did, you werent even there to vote for it. Thats not leadership, thats truancy.(APPLAUSE)And the fact is that what we need to do  what we need to have in this country is not to make the same mistake we made eight years ago. The fact is it does matter when you have to make decisions and be held accountable for them. It does matter when the challenges dont come on a list of a piece of paper of what to vote yes or no every day, but when the problems come in from the people that you serve.I like Marco Rubio, and hes a smart person and a good guy, but he simply does not have the experience to be president of the United States and make these decisions. Weve watched it happen, everybody. For the last seven years, the people of New Hampshire are smart. Do not make the same mistake again.RUBIO: If I may respond to that.(APPLAUSE)MUIR: Governor, thank you. Senator Rubio?RUBIO: Well, I think the experience is not just what you did, but how it worked out. Under Chris Christies governorship of New Jersey, theyve been downgraded nine times in their credit rating. This country already has a debt problem, we dont need to add to it by electing someone who has experience at running up and destroying the credit rating of his state.But I would add this. Lets dispel with this fiction that Barack Obama doesnt know what hes doing. He knows exactly what hes doing. He is trying to change this country. He wants America to become more like the rest of the world. We dont want to be like the rest of the world, we want to be the United States of America. And when Im elected president, this will become once again, the single greatest nation in the history of the world, not the disaster Barack Obama has imposed upon us.MUIR: Senator Rubio, thank you. I want to bring in governor bush on this, because you...CHRISTIE: Hold on one second.MUIR: ... have made this...CHRISTIE: Excuse me...MUIR: If youd like to respond to economic...CHRISTIE: I think he mentioned me and my record in there, so I think I get a chance to respond. You see, everybody, I want the people at home to think about this. Thats what Washington, D.C. Does. The drive-by shot at the beginning with incorrect and incomplete information and then the memorized 25-second speech that is exactly what his advisers gave him.(APPLAUSE)See Marco  Marco, the thing is this. When youre president of the United States, when youre a governor of a state, the memorized 30-second speech where you talk about how great America is at the end of it doesnt solve one problem for one person. They expect you to plow the snow. They expect you to get the schools open. And when the worst natural disaster in your states history hits you, they expect you to rebuild their state, which is what Ive done.None of that stuff happens on the floor of the United States Senate. Its a fine job, Im glad you ran for it, but it does not prepare you for president of the United States.(APPLAUSE)MUIR: Senator Rubio?RUBIO: Chris  Chris, your state got hit by a massive snowstorm two weeks ago. You didnt even want to go back. They had to shame you into going back. And then you stayed there for 36 hours and then he left and came back to campaign. Those are the facts.Heres the bottom line. This notion that Barack Obama doesnt know what hes doing is just not true. He knows exactly what hes doing.CHRISTIE: There it is. There it is. The memorized 25-second speech. There it is, everybody.RUBIO: Well, thats the  thats the reason why this campaign is so important. Because I think this notion  I think this is an important point. We have to understand what were going through here. We are not facing a president that doesnt know what hes doing. He knows what he is doing. Thats why hes done the things hes done.Thats why we have a president that passed Obamacare and the stimulus. All this damage that hes done to America is deliberate. This is a president thats trying to redefine this country. Thats why this election is truly a referendum on our identity as a nation, as a people. Our future is at stake.This election is not about the past. It is about what kind of country this is going to be in the 21st century, and if we elect someone like Barack Obama, a Hillary Clinton, a Bernie Sanders or anyone like that, our children are going to be the first Americans to inherit a diminishes country. That will not happen if Im elected.MUIR: Governor Christie, we will  we will...BUSH: Chris, why dont you mention my name so I can get into this.CHRISTIE: You know what the shame is  you know what the shame is, Marco? The shame is that you would actually criticize somebody for showing up to work, plowing the streets, getting the trains running back on time when youve never been responsible for that in your entire life.RUBIO: Chris, you didnt want to go back. You didnt want to go back.(APPLAUSE)CHRISTIE: And the fact is, I went back, it got done and heres...RUBIO: You didnt want to go back, Chris.CHRISTIE: Oh, so  wait a second. Is that one of the skills you get as a United States senator ESP also? Because I dont think it is.RUBIO: Chris, everybody  you said you werent going to go back. He told everyone he wasnt going to go back. They had to shame him into going back. And when he decided to go back, he criticized the young lady, saying, what am I supposed to do, go back with a mop and clean up the flooding?CHRISTIE: It gets very unruly when he gets off his talking points. MUIR: Governor Christie  thank you, Governor. I will mention  listen...RUBIO: ... Its your record, its not a talking point...MUIR: ... Listen, people...(APPLAUSE)MUIR: Governor Bush, Ill mention your name so that you can come in on this...BUSH: ... I appreciate that, I really do, thank you.MUIR: I want to bring you in on this because youve made this central to your campaign right here in New Hampshire in the last couple of days. Four Years ago you said of Senator Rubio, he was ready to be Vice President. You spoke of his experience as well. You said he has the fortitude to be a good President, but just this week you said Senator Rubio accomplished, quote, nothing in the Senate. How do you square the two?BUSH: Well, first of all he said the exact same thing about me, that I would make a great Vice Presidential nominee when Mitt Romney was considering. I said the same thing about Marco. I think we were both right at the time, and Mitt picked somebody else. So, lets move on to the 2016 race. Who has the leadership skills...(APPLAUSE)BUSH: ... Who has the leadership skills to lead? And, Im proud of the fact that I have 12 Medal of Honor recipients, over 30 admirals and generals that believe that I would be a steady hand as Commander in Chief. That I serve as Governor of the state of Florida where we cut taxes and reduced government. I took on very powerful interests, forged consensus, fought for my beliefs, implemented them and the state was better off.We had eight hurricanes and four tropical storms in 16 months. The whole state was turned upside down. It required a steady hand. Leadership. You learn this, you learn it by doing it. Its not something that you just go up, and on the job do it.(APPLAUSE)BUSH: Its not the same. Look, lets be clear. Marco Rubio is a gifted, gifted politician, and he may have the skills to be a President of the United States, but weve tried it the old way with Barack Obama, with soaring eloquence and we got  we didnt get a leader we got someone who wants to divide the country up. The next President...(BELL RINGING)BUSH: ... going to have to forge consensus to bring about a set of common purposes so that we can move forward again in this country...MUIR: ... Were going to continue with leadership now. Martha?RADDATZ: Senator Cruz, you are a first term Senator as well. Your opponents say you, like Senator Rubio, are not prepared to be Commander in Chief. You have talked tough about threats we face in the Mid-East. It was reported just moments ago that the North Koreans test launched an intercontinental ballistic missile. North Korea has nuclear weapons, and conducted another nuclear test just last month.The missile that was launched is the kind the North Koreans hope could someday carry a nuclear weapon capable of reaching the United States. How would you respond if Commander in Chief to that launch?CRUZ: Well, I would note, initially the fact that were seeing the launch, and were seeing the launch from a nuclear North Korea is the direct result of the failures of the first Clinton administration. The Clinton administration led the world in relaxing sanctions against North Korea. Billions of dollars flowed into North Korea in exchange for promises not to build nuclear weapons. They took those billions and built nuclear weapons.And, I would note also the lead negotiator in that failed North Korea sanctions deal was a woman named Wendy Sherman who Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton promptly recruited to come back to be the lead negotiator with Iran. So, what we are seeing with North Korea is foreshadowing of where we will be with Iran.With respect to North Korea and what we should do now, one of the first things we should do is expand our missile defense capacity. We ought to put missile defense interceptors in South Korea. South Korea wants them. One of the real risks of this launch, North Korea wants to launch a satellite, and one of the greatest risks of the satellite is they would place a nuclear device in the satellite. As it would orbit around the Earth, and as it got over the United States they would detonate that nuclear weapon and set of whats called an EMP, and electromagnetic pulse which could take down the entire electrical grid on the Eastern seaboard, potentially killing millions.We need to harden the grid to defend ourselves, and we need missile defense to protect ourselves against North Korea.RADDATZ: Well, let me ask you this, if you were Commander in Chief tonight would you have order the U.S. military to destroy that missile preemptively on the launchpad to prevent North Korea from becoming an even graver threat?CRUZ: You know, at this point Im not going to speculate on that without the intelligence briefing that any Commander in Chief would have, knowing what exactly is there.(APPLAUSE)CRUZ: One of the real problems...RADDATZ: ... Senator Cruz, let me tell you this, you have talked tough about the Mid-East, you havent gotten those intelligence briefings about that. Why not tell us whether you would preemptively strike a missile on a launchpad that threatens the U.S...CRUZ: ... Actually, with respect, I have gotten the intelligence briefings on the Mid-East. Those have been going on for many years. I havent gotten the intelligence briefing tonight on what North Koreas doing because Im here in new Hampshire. When youre responding to an immediate incident, you need to know the intelligence of whats occurring.CRUZ: But what I was saying  look, it is qualitatively different dealing with a country once they have nuclear weapons. Its why you prevent them from getting nuclear weapons in the first place  because your hands are somewhat tied once they have nukes.Its why this Iranian nuclear deal is so catastrophic, and its why Ive pledged, on the very first day in office, to rip to shreds this Iranian nuclear deal so were not sitting here in five years, wondering what to do about an Iranian missile launch when they have nuclear weapons. The stakes are too high for that.RADDATZ: Okay. Senator Cruz, I will say that missile has been sitting there for quite some time, and they have had eyes on it.RUBIO: But Martha, just  Martha, just to clarify on that point, because hes right, and one more thing to point  it is standard procedure of the United States to shoot down those missiles once launched if they pose a threat to civilians, land and ships (ph).RADDATZ: Senator Rubio, Im talking about a preemptive strike on the launch pad.RUBIO: Well  no, I understand. And not  but  but I think its important to note that it is  and Senator Cruz, I think, was alluding to this, as well  it is the standard procedure of the United States, if those missiles pose a threat to land, civilians, our allies or any of our assets, to shoot down that missile in mid-flight.I understand your question was about a preemptive strike, but my point is that there is in place now contingencies to avoid any sort of that strike (ph) from going errant and destroying any  any assets of the United States, or implicating or hurting any of our allies or any of our assets in the region.RADDATZ: OK. Thank you, Senator Rubio.Governor Kasich, how would you respond to tonights launch?KASICH: Well, weve got to to step up the pressure. And by the way, Ive gotta say, after being here, every one of my 100 town hall meetings in New Hampshire were a lot more fun than what I saw here today, were so much more positive.Look, in terms of North Korea, Martha, we have to make sure that we intercept both the ships and their aircraft, because what theyre trying to do is to proliferate this very dangerous material, along with the  with the technology, the instruments that can be used for mass destruction.Thats what I worry about the most, frankly, is non-state actors, people who dont have a uniform, people dont have a country, who can spread this, who are not subject to the  to the mutual assured defense. In other words, you strike us, we strike you.Some of these radicals, they dont care about that. Thats what I worry about, for my children, and for their children, going forward. So, we have to be very tough.And we should tell the Chinese, look, if youre not going to do this ballistic missile defense to the Koreans, ballistic missile defense to Japan  and by the way, we should impose the same kind of sanctions on North Korea that we imposed on Iran, because theyre able to shift money. Theyre able to send money and receive money.(BELL RINGS)KASICH: Weve gotta to be very tough on this. And frankly, I think we could have  I think we could have let the Japanese know that if you want to take action on that  on that missile thats rising, you want to take action  you will have our support, if thats what you think is the best thing to do. We cannot continue to be weak in the face of the North Koreans, or, frankly, in the entire rest of the world.Martha, this is  this is the  relates...RADDATZ: Thank you, Governor Kasich. Thank you  thank you...BUSH: ... this relates to strategic patience.(APPLAUSE)RADDATZ: ... Governor Bush, Ill get to you in a moment.BUSH: This relates to the strategic patience of the Obama administration. They come up with these great marketing terms, and what they do is they pull back, and voids are filled, and theyre now filled by asymmetric threats of terror, as well as nation-states on the run.The next president of the United States is gonna have to get the United States back in the game, and if a preemptive strike is necessary to keep us safe, then we should do it.(APPLAUSE)RADDATZ: Thank you, Governor Bush.Mr. Trump, do you have a red line with North Korea? Would you consider military action? And how far would you let them go?TRUMP: Well, let me say a couple of things. First of all, Marco said earlier on that President Obama knows exactly what hes doing, like we have this president that really knows. I disagree, respectfully, with Marco.I think we have a president who, as a president, is totally incompetent, and he doesnt know what hes doing.(APPLAUSE)I think he has no idea what hes doing. And our country is going to hell. So, I just want to say, we disagree on that. Is that okay?RUBIO: Yeah. I have a  I got mentioned, can I respond?TRUMP: Good.RADDATZ: And Id like him to finish the question, please.TRUMP: As to North Korea?RADDATZ: Specific  as to North Korea.TRUMP: We have  tremendous  has been just sucked out of our country by China. China says they dont have that good of control over North Korea. They have tremendous control. I deal with the Chinese all of the time. I do tremendous  the largest bank in the world is in one of my buildings in Manhattan.I deal with them. They tell me. They have total, absolute control, practically, of North Korea. They are sucking trillions of dollars out of our country  theyre rebuilding China with the money they take out of our country. I would get on with China, let China solve that problem.(BELL RINGS)They can do it quickly and surgically. Thats what we should do with North Korea.RADDATZ: Senator Rubio, you were mentioned.(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: Heres the broader point, as well, and then I think it touches on what Donald just menti",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ned. Barack Obama views America as this arrogant global power that needed to be cut down to size. OK? RUBIO: This is a president that views this country as a country thats been too powerful in the world and we create problems around the world.For example, its one of the reasons why he had betrayed Israel, because he believes that if we create separation from Israel, it will help our relations in the Islamic world. The same is happening in the Asia-Pacific region with accommodations to North Korea. North Korean should be back on that list of terrorist nations, as an example.And Donalds absolutely right. China does have a lot of influence over North Korea and he should be leveraging our relationship with the Chinese to ensure that North Korea no longer has access to the resources that have allowed them  a country that has no economy to develop long range missiles already capable of reaching the west coast of the United States potentially.RADDATZ: Thank you very much, Senator Rubio.Governor Bush, another problem facing the commander-in-chief right now is that North Korea is currently detaining an American college student. What would you do to get that college student back home?BUSH: Well, first of all, its interesting that that happened literally days when this hostage release took place in Iran. A day or two days afterwards, North Korea took a  held an American student hostage. I think its when we send a signal of weakness, when we are negotiating to release people that committed crimes in our country for people that didnt commit crimes that are held hostage in Iran.We saw the shameful treatment of our sailors, that this creates weakness  sends a signal of weakness around the world. The next president of the United States is going to have to get back in the game. Where the United States word matters. Where we back up our allies, where we dont send signals of weakness. We need to use every  every influence possible to get this student back.And I think John is right about this, there are crippling sanctions that are available, as it relates to the two or three banks that North Korea uses to  to  use it  illicit trade. We ought to re-establish sanctions, not just because of the student, but because of their actions that theyre taking right now, as it relates to building this missile capability.RADDATZ: Governor Christie, I want to go to you on the same question.(APPLAUSE)CHRISTIE: Lets get something...RADDATZ: Would you negotiate with North Korea to...CHRISTIE: No. Lets make something very clear. I learned seven years as a federal prosecutor in dealing with types of situations like were talking about in North Korea, where criminals take people hostage. You never pay ransom to the criminals. Ever. You never pay ransom to the criminals. Everyone out at home watching tonight understands that principle.And so, what you need to do is to engage in a much different way with these folks. They do not understand anything but toughness and strength, and we need to engage the Chinese to deal with the North Koreans, but we also need to make sure that they understand theres a commander-in-chief who will not pay ransom for any hostage.This president and his former secretary of State are for paying ransom for hostages. When do that, you endanger even more Americans around the world to be the subject of this type of hostage taking and illegal detention. You need a strong commander-in-chief who will look these folks in the eye and say, we will not put up with this and we will take whatever actions we need to take, not only to get our people home safely, but to swiftly and surely punish those who believe they can violate the law and violate Americans sovereign rights to travel the world freely and safely.This is unacceptable. And this is why this president is so weak and why the secretary of State, who is embracing a third Barack Obama term, would be even weaker.RADDATZ: Thank you very much, Governor Christie.(APPLAUSE)David?MUIR: Martha, were going to turn to immigration now. And I want to bring in Governor Kasich because you told us in an ABC interview, Governor, quote, It is completely ridiculous to think we are going to go into neighborhoods, grab people out of their homes and ship people back to Mexico. Adding, quote, Thats not where the party is. The party is not for departing 11.5 million people.But Mr. Trump and Senator Cruz, who have made deportation central to their campaigns, top the national polls. So, my question for you, are you not where the voters are?KASICH: Well, you know, David, I  Ive just spent a lot of time here in this state, as I mentioned earlier, and we have to have practical solutions, just like we were just talking about a few minutes ago on North Korea. Look, the situation is, we need to finish the border. It has to be completed. Just like we lock our doors at night, the country has to be able to lock its doors. And we can have a guest worker program, where people can come in and out in an orderly way.And then for the 11.5 million that are here, if they have not committed a crime since theyve been here, I believe they ought to pay some back taxes, pay a fine, never get on the path to citizenship, but get legalization. It is not  I couldnt even imagine how we would even begin to think about taking a mom or a dad out of a house when they have not committed a crime since theyve been here, leaving their children in the house. I mean, that is not, in my opinion, the kind of values that we believe in. KASICH: And secondly, I think at the end of the day, that Americans would support a plan like this. I think Congress would pass a plan to finish the border, guest worker, pay a fine, a path to legalization, and not citizenship. And weve got to get this done. And I will tell you this, within the first 100 days that I am president, I will put that proposal to the Congress. And I will tell you, as a former Congressman, and an executive, in Ohio, I can promise you that I believe youll get the votes to pass that, and we can move on with that issue and protect our border. Thats what I think.MUIR: Governor Kasich, thank you.(APPLAUSE)I want to bring this next to Senator Cruz. You heard what the governor said. He said, We need practical solutions. And youve said, I dont intend to send jack boots to knock on doors. Thats not how we enforce the law for any crime.So, what is your plan? How will you deport 11.5 million undocumented people? And be specific. How would you do it?CRUZ: So, in terms of a practical solution, Ive laid out the most detailed plan for solving illegal immigration. Its 11 pages, single-spaced, chapter and verse. Its on our website, tedcruz.org.In short, were going to do, were going to build a wall. Were going to triple the border patrol. Were going to increase  and actually, since Donald enjoyed that, I will simply say, Ive got somebody in mind to build it.Were going to increase four-fold, the fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft, so that you have technology monitoring an attempted incursion to direct the boots on the ground where theyre occurring. Were going to put in place a strong e-verify system in the workplace, so you cant get a job without proving you are here legally.Well put in place a biometric exit-entry system on visas, because 40 percent of illegal immigration comes not over the border illegally, but people coming on visas and overstaying.We will end sanctuary cities by cutting off taxpayer dollars to any jurisdiction that defies federal immigration law.(APPLAUSE)And we will end welfare benefits for those here illegally.(APPLAUSE)MUIR: Let me just ask you this, though, because Governor Kasich was talking about the families and what you do with the families that you would have to send home.Can you tell the American people tonight how you would do that?CRUZ: What you do is, you enforce the law. You know, under the Constitution, the president has an obligation to, quote, Take care that the laws be faithfully executed. Federal immigration law provides, if someone is here illegally and is apprehended, they are to be deported.We saw just this past week the head of the border patrol union testify before Congress that President Obama had given the order to the border patrol to stand down, not to enforce the law. That is wrong. I will enforce the law, and for everyone who says, you cant possibly do that, I would note that in eight years, Bill Clinton deported 12 million people.In eight years, George W. Bush deported 10 million people. Enforcing the law  we can do it. What is missing is the political will. And when they were deporting the people, the border wasnt secure, so theyd come right back. Once you secure the border, enforcing the law will solve this problem and that will benefit American workers.MUIR: Senator Cruz, thank you. I want to bring in Senator Rubio.This question is about immigration, it is also about leadership. Youre aware of the criticism from many candidates on this stage tonight that you co-authored the so-called Gang of Eight bill that would have created a path to citizenship for people here illegally.Governor Christie has said of you, as soon as you felt the heat, you turned tail and run. Governor Bush has said, I dont think we need people cutting and running anymore.Did you fight for your own legislation, Senator, or did you run from it?RUBIO: Heres the bottom line. We cant get that legislation passed. The American people will not support doing anything about people that are in this country illegally until the law is enforced first, and you prove it to them.This has been abundantly clear. Every effort over the last ten years to do those comprehensively has failed. And it has failed because the American people have zero trust that the federal government will enforce our laws.And thats why since then, I have said repeatedly, if you are serious about immigration reform, then the key that unlocks the door to being able to do that is not just to pass a law that says it is going to enforce the law, but to actually do it. To hire the 20,000 new border agents, to finish the fencing and walls, to put in place mandatory e-verify, to put in place an entry-exit tracking system to prevent visa overstays.And once that is in place and thats working, I believe the American people will support a very reasonable, but responsible approach to people that have been here a long time, who are not dangerous criminals, who pay taxes and pay fines for what they did.But until then, none of that is going to be possible.MUIR: But Im asking, did you fight for the legislation at the time or did you run from it as youre...RUBIO: Well, the legislation passed, but it has no support. In essence, it couldnt pass in the House, it will never pass in the United States until we secure the border, and it is not the way were going to do when Im president.When Im president, we are going to enforce the law first, prove to people that illegal immigration is under control. And then well see what the American people are willing to support when it comes to people that are not criminals, who have been in the this country for a long time and who otherwise would like to stay.MUIR: Governor Christie?CHRISTIE: Yeah, David, I would just like you to listen, again, everybody.This is the difference between being a governor who actually has to be responsible for problems and not answering a question. The question was, Did he fight for his legislation?(APPLAUSE)Its abundantly clear that he didnt. Its abundantly clear that he didnt fight for the legislation.CHRISTIE: When the teachers unions attacked me with $20 million of ads because I wanted to reform teacher tenure, I fought them and fought them and fought them and I won.When they didnt want  when people wanted to raise taxes in my state at Democratic legislature and threatened to close down the government, I told them, fine. Close down the government. Ill get in my cars, head to the governors mansion, order a pizza, open a beer and watch the Mets. You can call me when the government reopens.And guess what they didnt do? They didnt pass a tax increase, because I vetoed it and they never closed the government because they knew I would fight for what I believed in. The fact of the matter is, a leader must fight for what they believe in. Not handicap it and say, well maybe since I cant win this one, Ill run. Thats not what leadership is.(BELL RINGS)Thats what Congress is.(APPLAUSE)MUIR: Governor thank you.Senator Rubio?RUBIO: Leadership is ultimately about solving the problem. And the approach that was tried and has been tried now repeatedly over ten years to do this comprehensively, all at once in a massive piece of legislation has no chance of passage.It is not leadership to continue to try something that has no chance of happening. I want to make progress on this issue. It has been discussed now for 30 years and nothing ever happens.And I am telling you that the only way forward on this issue that has any chance of happening, meaning gaining the support of the American people, you cannot do this without the support of the American people, is an approach that begins by proving that once and for all, illegal immigration is under control.MUIR: Senator Rubio, thank you. We want to turn to health care in this country, and for that, author and commentator, Mary Katherine Ham tonight.HAM: Thanks, David.Good evening, guys.TRUMP: Good evening.RUBIO: Good evening.CHRISTIE: Good evening.KASICH: Good evening.CARSON: Good evening.CRUZ: Good evening.BUSH: Good evening.HAM: Mr. Trump.TRUMP: Yes.HAM: In the Democratic primary, Hillary Clinton has criticized Bernie Sanders plan for single payer government health care, noting it would require big, across the board tax increases for Americans. In doing so, shes doubling down on Obamacare, despite its persistent unpopularity.Mr. Trump, you have said you want to appeal Obamacare. You have also said, quote, Everybodys got to be covered, adding, quote, The governments going to pay for it. Are you closer to Bernie Sanders vision for health care than Hillary Clintons?TRUMP: I dont think I am. I think Im closer to common sense. We are going to repeal Obamacare.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: Were going to repeal Obamacare. We are going to replace Obamacare with something so much better. And there are so many examples of it. And I will tell you, part of the reason we have some people laughing, because you have insurance people that take care of everybody up here.I am self-funded. The only one theyre not taking care of is me. We have our lines around each state. The insurance companies are getting rich on Obamacare. The insurance companies are getting rich on health care and health services and everything having to do with health. We are going to end that.Were going to take out the artificial boundaries, the artificial lines. Were going to get a plan where people compete, free enterprise. They compete. So much better.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: In addition to that, you have the health care savings plans, which are excellent. What I do say is, there will be a certain number of people that will be on the street dying and as a Republican, I dont want that to happen. Were going to take care of people that are dying on the street because there will be a group of people that are not going to be able to even think in terms of private or anything else and were going to take care of those people.And I think everybody on this stage would have to agree...(BELL RINGS)... youre not going to let people die, sitting in the middle of a street in any city in this country.(APPLAUSE)RADDATZ: Senator Cruz, to that point, Mr. Trump has said that your position on health care means that maybe youve got, quote, no heart. There is a question here, though, about uncovered folks. You suggested repealing and replacing Obamacare. As we learned with President Obamas broken promise that everyone could keep their plan, any major plan  change in health care policy carries with it the risk that some people will lose their insurance coverage or have to change it.How do you reassure that those people that repealing and replacing Obamacare is still in their best interest?CRUZ: Well, let me take two different parts of that. Let me start with socialized medicine. Socialized medicine is a disaster. It does not work. If you look at the countries that have imposed socialized medicine, that have put the government in charge of providing medicine, what inevitably happens is rationing.You have a scarcity of doctors. You have rationing. And that means the elderly are told, were going to ration a hip replacement, were going to ration a knee replacement. Were going to ration end- of-life care.Were right now heading into a medical system with about a 90,000-doctor shortage in America and socialized medicine; whether proposed by the Democrats or proposed by a Republican would hurt the people of this country.What should we do on health care? If Im elected president, we will repeal every word of Obamacare.(APPLAUSE)CRUZ: And once we do that, we will adopt common sense reforms, number one, well allow people to purchase health insurance across state lines that will drive down prices and expand the availability of low cost catastrophic insurance.CRUZ: Well expand health savings accounts; and we will de-link health insurance from employment so that you dont lose your health insurance when you lose your job, and that way health insurance can be personal, portable and affordable and we keep government from getting in between us and our doctors.(APPLAUSE)HAM: Dr. Carson, you have some experience with this matter. In the past, you have said that Obamacare should be replaced before its repealed. How and why?CARSON: Well, thank you. You know, I was hoping to get a chance to talk about North Korea. I was the only one who didnt get to do that, and Ive got stuff to say about it, let me tell you.But at any rate, you have to replace it with something that makes sense. It doesnt make sense. And the reason that I dislike Obamacare is because the government comes in and tells the people  which the nation is supposed to be centered on  that we dont care what you think, this is what were doing. And if you dont like it, too bad. Thats a problem. And we cant afford to do that because that will fundamentally change America.I have proposed a health empowerment account system. Everybody gets a health empowerment account the day they are born, they keep it until they die. They can pass it on. We pay for it with the same dollars that we pay for traditional health care with, recognizing that we spend twice as much as many countries per capita and health care and dont have as such access.We give people the ability to shift money within their health empowerment account so that each family basically becomes its own insurance company without a middleman; that saves you a awful lot of money. And that will lower the cost of your catastrophic insurance tremendously, because the only thing coming out of that is catastrophic health care.And then in terms of taking care of the indigent, we have another whole system, and I can go ahead and explain it, but I dont have the time, but Id be happy to if you give me some more time. But go to my website bencarson.com, read about it. You can read about everything thats been discussed here in great detail.(APPLAUSE)HAM: Thank you, Dr. Carson. David, Martha, back to you.MUIR: Mary Katherine, thank you. We want to turn now to the issue of eminent domain, which is being debated right here in New Hampshire. And Josh McElveen is the political director and the anchor of WMUR TV. Josh?MCELVEEN: Thank you, David. And good evening, candidates. Mr. Trump, you have said, quote, I love eminent domain which is the seizure of private property for the sake of the greater good theoretically. You tried to use the measure in business endeavors, youve said youd support its use for the Keystone Pipeline project.Here in New Hampshire, a project, though, known as the Northern pass would bring hydro-electric power from Canada into the Northeastern grid. Do you see eminent domain as an appropriate tool to get that done?TRUMP: Well, let me just tell you about eminent domain because almost all of these people actually criticize it, but so many people have hit me with commercials and other things about eminent domain.Eminent domain is an absolute necessity for a country, for our country. Without it, you wouldnt have roads, you wouldnt have hospitals, you wouldnt have anything. You wouldnt have schools, you wouldnt have bridges. You need eminent domain. And a lot of the big conservatives that tell me how conservative they are  I think Im more than they are  they tell me, oh  well, they all want the Keystone Pipeline. The Keystone Pipeline, without eminent domain, it wouldnt go 10 feet, OK? You need eminent domain. And eminent domain is a good thing, not a bad thing.And what a lot of people dont know because they were all saying, oh, youre going to take their property. When somebody  when eminent domain is used on somebodys property, that person gets a fortune. They get at least fair market value, and if they are smart, theyll get two or three times the value of their property. But without eminent domain, you dont have roads, highways, schools, bridges or anything.So eminent domain  its not that I love it, but eminent domain is absolutely  its a necessity for a country. And certainly its a necessity for our country.MCELVEEN: So would that be yes on the Northern Pass project?(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: Yes.BUSH: The difference  the difference between eminent domain for public purpose  as Donald said, roads and infrastructure, pipelines and all that  thats for public purpose. But what Donald Trump did was use eminent domain to try to take the property of an elderly woman on the strip in Atlantic City. That is not public purpose, that is down right wrong.(APPLAUSE)And heres the problem with that. The problem was, it was to tear down  it was to tear down  it was to tear down the house...TRUMP: Jeb wants to be  he wants to be a tough guy tonight. I didnt take the property.BUSH: And the net result was  you tried.TRUMP: I didnt take the property.BUSH: And you lost in the court.TRUMP: The woman ultimately didnt want to do that. I walked away.BUSH: That is not true. And the simple fact is to turn this into a limousine parking lot for his casinos is a not public use.(APPLAUSE)And in Florida, based on what we did, we made that impossible. It is part of our Constitution. Thats the better approach. That is the conservative approach.MCELVEEN: Mr. Trump, take 30 seconds.TRUMP: Well, let me just  you know, he wants to be a tough guy. A lot of times, youll have  youll have  and it didnt work very well.BUSH: How tough it is to take away property from an elderly woman?TRUMP: A lot of time  let me talk. Quiet. A lot of times  a lot of times...BUSH: How tough it is to take away a property from an elderly woman?TRUMP: ... you  let me talk. Let me talk. Quiet. A lot of times...(BOOING)... thats all of his donors and special interests out there.(BOOING)So  its what it is. Thats what  and by the way, let me just tell you, we needed tickets. You cant get them. You know who has the tickets for the  Im talking about, to the television audience? Donors, special interests, the people that are putting up the money.(BOOING)Thats who it is. The RNC told us. We have all donors in the audience. And the reason theyre not loving me...(BOOING)... the reason theyre not  excuse me. The reason theyre not loving me is, I dont want their money. Im going to do the right thing for the American public. I dont want their money. I dont need their money. And Im the only one up here that can say that.Eminent domain, the Keystone pipeline  do you consider that a private job? Do you  do you consider that...BUSH: I consider it a public use.TRUMP: No  no, let me ask you, Jeb.(BELL RINGS)Do you consider the Keystone pipeline private?BUSH: Its a public use. Its a public use.TRUMP: Is it public or private?BUSH: Its a public use. TRUMP: Real  a public use?BUSH: Yeah.TRUMP: No, its a private job.BUSH: Its a public use.TRUMP: Its a private job.BUSH: Established by the courts  federal, state courts.TRUMP: You wouldnt have the Keystone pipeline that you want so badly without eminent domain.MCELVEEN: All right, gentlemen...TRUMP: You wouldnt have massive  excuse me, Josh  you wouldnt have massive factories without eminent domain.(BOOING)MCELVEEN: Gentlemen, we do have to move forward. Dave, Martha, back to you.MUIR: Josh, thank you.When we come back here tonight, jobs, ISIS, and what it means to be a conservative.(APPLAUSE)MUIR: The Republican debate continues right here from New Hampshire on ABC. Well be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)STEPHANOPOULOS: Candidates taking a quick break. Im here with Jon Karl right now, and boy, Jon. Marco Rubio came into this debate with a head of steam, ran right into Chris Christie.KARL: I have never seen Christie tougher in this race. I have never seen Marco Rubio more rattled. He repeated himself three times, precisely when Chris Christies criticism was you always repeat yourself with the same canned speech. This was a tough moment for Marco Rubio.STEPHANOPOULOS: Donald Trump started out more subdued than in the past for most of the debate, right up until the end of that first section when the issue of eminent domain came up, and Jeb Bush was ready.KARL: It almost makes you wonder where would we be in this race right now if Jeb Bush had been that energetic, and that forceful in going after Donald Trump from the start in the previous debates.STEPHANOPOULOS: He has been hitting Donald Trump, but this...KARL: ... But not effectively...STEPHANOPOULOS: ... He did seem to draw some blood, and he seemed to have the crowd on his side, at least for part of that answer tonight. OK, well be right back. The candidates on the stage in just a minute.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(UNKNOWN): Live from Saint Anselm College in New Hampshire, here again are David Muir, and Martha Raddatz.MUIR: And, we welcome you back to the Republican debate from New Hampshire tonight here on ABC. Were going to turn now to what it means to be a conservative, and I want to turn to Governor Kasich.Governor, while campaigning here in New Hampshire, you were already asked about groans from some conservatives after your endorsements from the New York Times, and the Boston Globe. You said, quote, What conservatives have to know is they have to say, look isnt it nice to have a conservative like me liked? And, maybe the ought to think about it because if I get elected president, the Republican party and the definition of conservatism is going to change.How would you change conservatism?KASICH: Well, first of all, look. As the New York Times said, hes certainly not a moderate, but he can bring people together to solve problems. The fact of the matter is Ive cut taxes more than anybody in the country this year. I have balanced budgets, the federal budget, the state of Ohio budget, were running a $2 billion dollar surplus, were up 400,000 jobs, and in Washington we were able to have significant job growth whenever we balanced the budget of which I was the architect.But, heres the beauty of it, its not just balancing a budget, its about jobs. You know, when I was kid growing up in a neighborhood where Dad went home at night and said, I lost my job today, it just killed the family.It just was a devastating effect. We have to have economic growth, but once we have economic growth I believe we have to reach out to people who live in the shadows. I believe we need to help the mentally ill, the drug addicted, the working poor. We need to help the developmentally disabled to rise, and we need to help our friends in the minority community develop entrepreneurship. In other words, in American, conservatism should mean not only that some rise with conservative principles, but everybody has a chance to rise regardless of who they are so they can live their God given purpose. Thats what conservatism should be.(APPLAUSE)MUIR: Governor Kasich, thank you.Mr. Trump, youve heard the argument from many of the candidates on this stage that youre not a true conservative. Tell the voters watching tonight why you are.TRUMP: Well, I think I am, and to me, I view the word conservative as a derivative I  of  of the word conserve. We want to converse our money. We want to conserve our wealth. We want to conserve. We want to be smart. We want to be smart where we go, where we spend, how we spend. We want to conserve our country. We want to save our country. And we have people that have no idea how to do that and they are not doing it, and its a very important word and its something I believe in very, very strongly.MUIR: Mr. Trump, thank you.(APPLAUSE)Senator Rubio, you have said yourself that you dont think Donald Trump is running as a conservative. Did he convince you?RUBIO: Well, I think conservatism is about three things and Donald touched on one of them, but its about three things. The first is conservatism is about limited government, especially at the federal level. The federal government is a limited government, limited by the Constitution, which delineates its powers. If its not in the Constitution, it does not belong to the federal government. It belongs to states, local communities and the private sector.Its about free enterprise, which is an economic model that allows everyone to rise without pulling anyone down. The reason why free enterprise is the greatest economic model in the history of the world is because its the only economic model where you can make poor people richer without making rich people poor.And its about a strong national defense. Its about believing, unlike Barack Obama, that the world is a safer and a better place when America is the strongest military and the strongest nation on this planet. Thats conservatism.(APPLAUSE)MUIR: Senator Rubio, thank you. I want to turn this discussion to the economy now.And Mr. Trump, Governor Christie has said, I tell everybody who goes to a Donald Trump event, if you get to ask a question, just ask him how. Christie said, I dont care which of the things he talks about, just ask him how. You have said that youd be the greatest jobs president God ever created. Tell Americans watching tonight how many jobs you would create in the first term and how.TRUMP: Well, before I go there, I will tell you, I will bring jobs back from China. I will bring jobs back from Japan. I will bring jobs back from Mexico, where New Hampshire, by the way, has been virtually wiped out. Theyve lost so many businesses going to Mexico because of horrible trade deals. And now were about to sign another trade deal, TPP, which is going to be a disaster for this country because they dont talk about monetary manipulation. It is going to be a disaster.Im going to bring jobs back and Ill start bringing them back very fast. Under my tax plan  right now, were the highest taxed country in the world. Under my plan, we cut not only taxes for the middle class, but we cut taxes for corporations. We will bring back trillions of dollars thats offshore. Right now, they have $2.5 trillion, and in my opinion, its much more than that. Thats what the government says. All of that money is going to come back.And were not going to lose Pfizer, which is now leaving, and other great companies, which is now leaving. And theyre all leaving. We have many, many companies that are leaving this country. Were not going to lose them anymore because were going to have a tax structure that is going to keep them in our country.MUIR: Mr. Trump, thank you.There are a lot of governors on this stage tonight and Governor Christie, Governor Kasich said of you, quote, In Ohio, we balanced a budget. They dont have one over in New Jersey. Our credit has been strengthened. Their credit has been downgraded. Weve got more jobs.How important are those metrics in choosing the next president? And is his job  is his record on jobs, I should say, actually stronger than yours?CHRISTIE: Well, he deserves credit for his record on jobs. Hes done a very good job as governor of Ohio. Never said that John hasnt. Hes done a very good job.(APPLAUSE)But  but unfortunately, Johns been so busy doing over stuff, hes using old statistics. Thats OK. New Jersey had its best year of job growth in the last 15 years under five different governors this year in New Jersey. New Jersey cut spending over $2.3 billion and we have 10,000 fewer employees than we had when I walked in the door. John has a bigger government now and more employees than he had when he walked in the door.But all that doesnt matter. What really matters is this, that executive experience really matters. You heard this on the stage tonight. Weve heard it said on the stage that President Obama knows exactly what hes doing.Id like to ask all the veterans listening out there tonight, who are waiting in line for healthcare, who are literally dying because the Veterans Administration doesnt work, do you think Barack Obama knows what hes doing? I dont. And Ill tell you something. Anybody who evaluates him is knowing what hes doing and managing the government doesnt know how to manage a government themselves.And one last thing, David, which I think is really important. I listened to Senator Rubios answer on his bill. He said his bill couldnt pass on the gang of eight. He acted as if he was somehow disembodied from the bill. It was his bill. He said this idea doesnt work. It was his idea.See, when youre a governor, you have to take responsibility for these things. You cant just act as if it happened out of nowhere. We have to take responsibility as executives. I take responsibility for my record in New Jersey. Weve rebuilt the economy and rebuilt after the second-worst natural disaster in American history. Im proud of my record. And by the way, I like Kasichs record, too. Hes a good governor.(APPLAUSE)KASICH: David?MUIR: Thank you, Governor.Governor Kasich?KASICH: Look, Im  Im not here  I like Chris.MUIR: He didnt say your record was better than his.KASICH: Let  but let me  let me just tell you. First of all, we have the lowest number of state employees in 30 years.Secondly, we have grown government at the rate of inflation. And I went from an $8 billion hole to a $2 billion surplus. And weve grown jobs by 400,000  thats one of the fastest growing states in the country. Our pensions are secure and our credit is rock solid.Now, Ive learned that, what makes things work, what gets the economy going, not just in Ohio, but in Washington  and its three things. Common sense regulations, which we have, lower taxes, which we have, the lowest taxes, tax cuts in the country. And thirdly, a fiscal plan to balance the budget.When you go from $8 billion in the hole to $2 billion in the black, when you cut taxes by $5 billion and you grow over 400,000 jobs, that is a record that I can take to Washington, using the same formula that I used in Washington when I was part of the effort to balance the budget to give us a surplus and to create jobs.MUIR: Governor Kasich, thank you.KASICH: Thats what I did and Ill do it again in the first 100 days.KASICH: Governor Kasich, thank you. I do want to turn from jobs to taxes.RUBIO: Now, see, I was mentioned by Governor...MUIR: If you would like to respond to the governor, you can.RUBIO: Yeah.MUIR: Im coming to you next with a question, anyway. You can respond to that question.RUBIO: OK, good, then Ill get to it (inaudible). Heres the...MUIR: Were going from jobs to taxes, and heres the...RUBIO: Well, no, sorry. Let me respond to that question.MUIR: To the Gang of Eight bill first?RUBIO: Well, heres the response. I think anyone who believes that Barack Obama isnt doing what hes doing on purpose doesnt understand what were dealing with here, OK? This is a president  this is a president who is trying to change this country. When he talked about change, he wasnt talking about dealing with our problems.Obamacare was not an accident. The undermining of the Second Amendment is not an accident. The gutting of our military is not an accident. The undermining of America on the global stage is not an accident. Barack Obama is, indeed, trying to redefine this country. We better understand what were dealing with here, because thats what Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders want to double down on if they are elected.MUIR: The governor wasnt talking about the president, he was talking about the Gang of Eight bill.(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: No. He talked about Barack Obama.MUIR: So, let me ask you about taxes, Senator Rubio.RUBIO: Yeah.MUIR: A recent poll, 68 percent of Americans favor raising taxes on people making more than $1 million a year. Are they wrong?RUBIO: I dont know of any problem in America thats going to be fixed with a tax increase. We have an economy today, an economy today that is not creating jobs that pay enough.And one of the reasons why is because we have one of the most expensive business tax rates on the planet. Our combined business rate puts us among the highest in the industrialized world. And then on top of that, we are the only one that has a worldwide system of taxation, where an American company who makes money abroad has to pay taxes where they made the money and then taxes a second time when they bring it back.The combination of these two things has stranded over $2 trillion, the equivalent of the size of the Russian economy, $2 trillion of American corporate money stranded overseas, combined with all of these inversions of companies leaving us.The solution to the problems we have today are not a tax increase. It is to lower our taxes on both people and on companies, so we can make America globally competitive again.(APPLAUSE)MUIR: Senator Rubio, thank you.I want to bring in Governor Bush. And Governor, I just want to repeat that number for you  68 percent of Americans favor raising taxes on people making more than a million.What do you say to the people who believe that tonight?BUSH: I would like to see more millionaires. I think we need to grow more millionaires, we need create a prosperity society where people can rise up.(APPLAUSE)This notion that somehow were undertaxed as a nation is just fool hearty, when we have entitlements growing far faster than our ability to pay for it. A conservative, because thats the point of this, believes in limited government, believes in a entrepreneurial capitalism and a strong national defense.But it also has to be, we need to reform things. In my town hall meetings, I went to a place where a woman described her neighbor, who has a better economic deal by not working than her struggling to make ends meet. We need to be on the side of working people. And you know, the problem with the left is, another tax, another regulation, another mandate makes it harder for them to rise up.Everything that we should do should be focused on high, sustained economic growth, where the middle class gets a raise for the first time, and where people are rewarded for work, rather than non-work. And I know how to do this. And if people are interested in the specifics of this, they ought to go to jeb2016.com.(APPLAUSE)MUIR: Knew that was coming. Governor, thank you.CHRISTIE: David? Hey, David? David? Hey, David? I actually have experience with raising taxes on millionaires in my state. It was done. It was done by my predecessor.And I want everybody in the public who is in that 68 percent, I want to tell you the truth. Youre wrong. And here is why youre wrong. After New Jersey raised taxes on millionaires, we lost, in the next four years, $70 billion in wealth left our state.It left our state to go where it would be treated more kindly. If the United States raised taxes any further, that money will leave the United States, as well. We wont have better jobs.Let New Jersey be the canary in the coal mine. It is a failed idea and a failed policy, its class warfare. It happened in my state. Ive stopped it from happening again. But we cannot do it.The 68 percent of the people are wrong about that, it will hurt the American economy. We tried it in New Jersey. Come take a look  it did not work. (APPLAUSE)MUIR: Governor Christie, thank you.(APPLAUSE) Martha?RADDATZ: Senator Cruz, you advocate what you call carpet bombing, or saturation bombing, to defeat ISIS, citing the more than 1,100 air attacks that the U.S. carried out during the first Gulf War in 1991.Explain how a strategy to defeat a standing army would work against an unconventional terrorist group that is now hiding amongst the population.CRUZ: Well, sure. It starts with a commander-in-chief that sets the objective. And the objective has to be utterly and completely destroying ISIS. Obama hasnt started with that objective and everything else flows from there.Once you set that objective, we have the tools to carry that out. The first tool is overwhelming air power. It is one of the blessings of the United States of America, having the greatest military on the face of the earth, is we have the ability to use that air power.As you know, in the first Persian Gulf War, it was 1,100 air attacks a day. Obama is launching between 15 and 30. Now, when I say saturation carpet bombing, that is not indiscriminate.That is targeted at oil facilities. Its targeted at the oil tankers. Its targeted at command and control locations. Its targeted at infrastructure. Its targeted at communications. Its targeted at bombing all of the roads and bridges going in and out of Raqqa. Its using overwhelming air power.You know, couple of weeks ago, it was reported that a facility is open called Jihadist University. Now, the question I wonder, why is that building still standing? It should be rubble. And if you had a president...(BELL RINGS)(APPLAUSE)CRUZ: ... all though I will say this. I would be willing to wait until freshman orientation before launching those bombs. RADDATZ: Senator Cruz, would you like to expand or loosen the rules of engagement? I was just over in a command center in Erbil and they said they thought the rules of engagement worked. Because you have so many civilians in those populated areas, they dont want to hit civilians.CRUZ: Martha, I will tell you, I have visited with active duty military, with veterans over and over and over again in town halls all over the state of New Hampshire. What we are doing to our sons and daughters, it is immoral. We are sending them into fight with their arms tied behind their back. They cannot defend themselves. And it is wrong.(APPLAUSE)CRUZ: And I will tell you this. Look. America has always been reluctant to use military force. Its the last step we take. But if and when we use it when it comes to defeating ISIS, we should use it. We should use overwhelming force, kill the enemy and then get the heck out. Dont engage in nation-building but instead, allow our soldiers to do their jobs instead of risking their lives with politicians making it impossible to accomplish the objective.(APPLAUSE)RADDATZ: So, loosen the rules of engagement?CRUZ: Absolutely, yes.RADDATZ: Senator Rubio, you said in the last debate that ISIS is the most dangerous, jihadist group in the history of mankind And that will it take overwhelming U.S. force to defeat them. Can you specifically tell us what you mean by overwhelming force?RUBIO: Well, first, we need to understand who they are. ISIS is not just a jihadist group, theyre an apocalyptic group. They want to trigger a showdown in a city named Tibet between the west and themselves which they believe will trigger the arrival of their messianic figure.And Im not saying thats whats going to happen. The reason why its important to understand that is because these are not groups that are just going to go away on their own. They are going to have to be defeated. And I believe they need to be defeated on the ground, by a ground force, made up primarily of Sunni Arabs.It will take Sunni Arabs to reject them ideologically and defeat them militarily. That will require a coalition of Iraqis and Syrians, that are also Sunnis, but it will also require the cooperation of Jordanians, Egyptians. We should ask more of the Saudis.That will need to be backed up with more U.S. special operation forces alongside them. And it will have to be backed up with increased air strikes. And we are going to have to strike them, not just in Iraq and in Syria, but in every other part of the world where they have now created hubs of operation. They have affiliates in over a dozen countries across this planet. They have a sophisticated network of radicalizing people here in the homeland and around the world.(BELL RINGS)But it all begins by taking away their their safe operating spaces with a ground force that a U.S.-led coalition takes on.(APPLAUSE)RADDATZ: Again, Senator Rubio, youve already said ISIS is the most dangerous jihadist group in the history of mankind. So, that would make it more dangerous than Al Qaida, the insurgents we fought in Iraq. We committed hundreds of thousands of U.S. troops to fight those groups. So if ISIS is the most dangerous group in history, why not commit a large U.S. ground force?RUBIO: Because they currently occupy Sunni cities and villages. Sunni cities and villages can only truly be liberated and held by Sunnis themselves. If they are held by Shias it will trigger sectarian violence. The Kurds are incredible fighters and they will liberate the Kurdish areas, but Kurds can not and do not want to liberate and hold Sunni villages and towns.RUBIO: It will take Sunni fighters themselves in that region to take those villages and cities, and then to hold them and avoid the sort of sectarian violence that follows in the past.And why that is important is because if Sunnis are not able to govern themselves in these areas, you are going to have a successor group to ISIS. ISIS is a successor group of Al Qaida. In fact, they broke away...(BELL RINGS)... from Al Qaida, because as horrible as Al Qaida is, ISIS thought Al Qaida was not radical enough. This is who were dealing with, and they have more money than Al Qaida ever had.BUSH (?): Martha  Martha, if I...RADDATZ: Well, what would you do  what would you do differently to try to get those Sunni forces? They have not been coming forward.RUBIO: Well, the problem with the Sunni forces in the region is they dont trust this administration. This administration cut a deal with their mortal enemies, the Shia, in Iran. It poisoned the well with these countries. It makes it very difficult to cooperate with them as a result.They also, by the way, understand what real U.S. air power looks like. They saw the Iraq war. They saw, up close, also Afghanistan. They know what air power looks like when the United States is committed to the cause. And they see the airstrikes that are being conducted now, and they say to themselves, thats not real (ph) commitment. We know what real commitment looks like.The  the Jordanian king was in Washington three weeks ago. He told everyone who would listen that they have begged for permission from the coalition to target caravans. And the coalition  meaning U.S. leadership on the ground...(BELL RINGS)... would not allow them to proceed with those airstrikes.RADDATZ: Mr. Trump  thank you very much, Senator Rubio. Mr. Trump.(APPLAUSE)You have said you will vigorously bomb ISIS. Youve said, weve got to get rid of ISIS, quickly, quickly. How would you get rid of them so quickly? And please give us specifics.TRUMP: Well, four years ago, I said, bomb the oil and take the oil. And if we did that, they wouldnt have the wealth they have right now. Now, I still say the same thing, because were doing little pinpricks. Were not even bombing  if somebodys driving a truck, they give notice to the person driving the truck, were going to bomb. If they dont get out of the truck, the truck sails away with the oil.We actually have a case where we dont want to bomb the oil, because we dont want to hurt  pollute the atmosphere. Can you imagine General Douglas MacArthur or General Patton saying we cant bomb because were gonna hurt the atmosphere?You have to knock the hell out of the oil. You have to take the oil. And you have also back channels of banking. You have people that you think are our great allies, our friends, in the Middle East, that are paying tremendous numbers of  tremendous amounts of money to ISIS.So we have to stop those circuits. Nobody knows banking better than I do. They have back circuits, back channels. Tremendous amounts of money is coming in through the banking system. So between the oil and the banking, you will dry them up. But it should have been done four years ago, not now.RADDATZ: And  and what would you do in those cities, where there are people who we are trying to help, who ISIS is essentially holding hostage?TRUMP: You have to go in  first of all, when you take away their money, when you take away their wealth, thatll very much weaken  and it will happen fairly fast.Theyll last for about a year, based on all of the wealth theyve accumulated. But when you stop the banking channels and when you stop the oil and take the oil  not just bomb it, take it  when you do that, its going to dry up very quickly. Theyre going to become a very weakened power, quickly. Thank you.RADDATZ: Thank you very much, Mr. Trump.(APPLAUSE)Lets turn to Libya. Governor Bush, it is a country in chaos. There is no government. This week, defense officials said there are now 5,000 ISIS fighters there, roughly doubling previous estimates. We know you and others have been critical of the administrations handling of Libya after the initial air strikes that you supported.But this is a problem you would stand to inherit if youre the next president. Reports this week said the administration is considering new air strikes, possible special operations raids. Would you support renewed air strikes or any U.S. involvement on the ground?BUSH: I would. And I would do it in concert, again, with our Arab allies and with Europe, most particularly in this case. This is the lesson learned: in history, if you bomb something and not do anything as it relates to deal with the aftermath of this, if you dont have a stable government, you get what we have in Libya.And this is not  leading from behind is not an effective policy. We have to lead. Without the United States, nothing seems to work. Europe doesnt have the ability to  to  to lead  forward lean (ph) in this regard.And so dealing with the caliphate is important, because it now has spawned other areas. There have been 70-plus attacks in 17 countries, either inspired by ISIS or organized by ISIS, Libya being the most important one now.We have to deal with the caliphate, with building a Sunni army there, but we also have to deal with it in Libya. And I think the United States, ultimately, is going to play  play a significant role in this.The problem with the Obama administration is that they see this incrementally. Theyre reluctant. They dont lead. No one knows whether were serious, and when we do it, we do it in increments you can barely see.(BELL RINGS)The United States has to lead in a much more aggressive way than were doing right now.(APPLAUSE)RADDATZ: Thank you very much, Governor Bush. Dr. Carson?CARSON: I want to say something about this, because Im not here just to add beauty to the stage.(LAUGHTER)You know, Ive been talking about Libya for quite a long time. I think I was the first one to start talking about it because I say we have to have a proactive foreign policy strategy. And of course, the next place that ISIS is going to attack to is Libya.If you want to expand your caliphate and increase your influence, then youre going to go to a place thats strategically located. You go north, across the Mediterranean. Youre into southern Europe. You go south, youre into Chad and Sudan and Niger. Not to mention the fact that you have much more oil than you do in Iraq. Thats the kind of place that theyre going to go to, therefore, we need to be thinking about how do we prevent them from tacking over there. Theyre already sending their fighters there, we need to be consulting with our military experts and asking them what do they need in order to prevent ISIS from being able to take over Libya. Thats going to have enormous concede for us.RADDATZ: And would you support renewed airstrikes?CARSON: I would support the possibility of renewed airstrikes if in conjunction with our Joint Chiefs and our military people they felt that was an appropriate strategy.The fact of the matter is none of us up here is a military expert, and we sometimes act like we are, but were not. And if we actually sit down and talk with them and get them to understand our plan and their impression of what needs to be done, I think were going to make a lot more progress.BUSH: Martha and David, I just...RADDATZ: Were going to move on.BUSH: Martha and David...MUIR: Martha, thank you. Were just going to  were going to stay on ISIS here and the war on terror, because as you know, theres been a debate in this country about how to deal with the enemy and about enhanced interrogation techniques ever since 9/11.So Senator Cruz, you have said, quote, torture is wrong, unambiguously, period. Civilized nations do not engage in torture. Some of the other candidates say they dont think waterboarding is torture. Mr. Trump has said, I would bring it back. Senator Cruz, is waterboarding torture?CRUZ: Well, under the definition of torture, no, its not. Under the law, torture is excruciating pain that is equivalent to losing organs and systems, so under the definition of torture, it is not. It is enhanced interrogation, it is vigorous interrogation, but it does not meet the generally recognized definition of torture.MUIR: If elected president, would you bring it back?CRUZ: I would not bring it back in any sort of widespread use. And indeed, I joined with Senator McCain in legislation that would prohibit line officers from employing it because I think bad things happen when enhanced interrogation is employed at lower levels.But when it comes to keeping this country safe, the commander in chief has inherent constitutional authority to keep this country safe. And so, if it were necessary to, say, prevent a city from facing an imminent terrorist attack, you can rest assured that as commander in chief, I would use whatever enhanced interrogation methods we could to keep this country safe.MUIR: Senator Cruz, thank you. Mr. Trump, you said not only does it work, but that youd bring it back.TRUMP: Well, Ill tell you what. In the Middle East, we have people chopping the heads off Christians, we have people chopping the heads off many other people. We have things that we have never seen before  as a group, we have never seen before, whats happening right now.The medieval times  I mean, we studied medieval times  not since medieval times have people seen whats going on. I would bring back waterboarding and Id bring back a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding.(APPLAUSE)MUIR: Mr. Trump, thank you. Governor Bush, you have said that you wont rule waterboarding out. Congress has passed laws banning the use of waterboarding by the military and the CIA, as you know. Would you want Congress to change that if youre elected president?BUSH: No, no, I wouldnt. No, I wouldnt. And it was used sparingly, Congress has changed the laws and I  and I think where we stand is the appropriate place. But what we need to do is to make sure that we expand our intelligence capabilities.The idea that were going to solve this fight with predator drones, killing people somehow is a  is more acceptable than capturing them, securing the information. This is why closing Guantanamo is a complete disaster. What we need to do is make sure that we are kept safe...(APPLAUSE)... by having intelligence capabilities, both human and technological intelligence capabilities far superior than what we have today. Thats how you get a more safe place is by making sure that were fully engaged. And right now, this administration doesnt do that.BUSH: Governor Bush, thank you.(APPLAUSE)Senator Rubio, I do want to ask you, you have said that you do not want to telegraph to the enemy what you would do as commander in chief. But for the American people watching tonight who want to know where the next president will stand, do you believe waterboarding is torture?RUBIO: Well, when people talk about interrogating terrorists, theyre acting like this is some sort of law enforcement function. Law enforcement is about gathering evidence to take someone to trial, and convict them. Anti-terrorism is about finding out information to prevent a future attack so the same tactics do not apply.And, it is true, we should not be discussing in a wide spread way the exact tactics that were going to use because that allows terrorist to know to practice how to evade us.But, heres the bigger problem with all this, were not interrogating anybody right now. Guantanamos being emptied by this president. We should be putting people into Guantanamo, not emptying it out, and we shouldnt be releasing these killers who are rejoining the battlefield against the United States.(APPLAUSE)MUIR: Senator Rubio, thank you.We want to turn now to the topic of executive orders, and for that, were going to turn back to Mary Katharine Ham. Mary Katharine?HAM: Thanks, David. Senator Cruz, on the campaign trail youve promised voters a lot, in fact if youre elected president youd say you end Common Core immediately, abolish the IRS, and do away with sanctuary cities. Youve also been a persistent critic of President Obamas executive overreach, going it alone, not working with Congress. How do you intend to implement this aggressive agenda within your Constitutional authority, especially given that it would require working with Congress and Washington players with whom youre happy to say you have a strained relationship?CRUZ: Well, thank you for that question. You know, there are three avenues of presidential authority to change the direction of this country. The first is executive power, the second is foreign policy, and the third is legislation. Executive power, as we all know, has been the preferred vehicle of President Obama, abusing his authority, abusing his constitutional authority.Now, the silver lining of that is everything done with executive power can be undone with executive power, so I have pledged on day one I will rescind every single illegal and unconstitutional executive action Barack Obama has done. That means on day one his efforts to restrict the Second Amendment go away with the strike of a pen. That means on day one his illegal executive amnesty goes away with the strike of a pen.The reason I can end Common Core at the federal level is because Obama is abusing executive power using Race to the Top funds in the Department of Education to force it on the states. Thats one avenue.The second avenue of change is foreign policy, and foreign policy can change the fastest. Its worth remembering that Iran released our hostages the day Reagan...(BELL RINGING)CRUZ: ... Was sworn in. And, the third is legislation, and that can only be done with the people behind you, which is why the two big legislative initiatives Im campaigning on are repealing Obamacare, and adopting a simple flat tax to abolish the IRS.(APPLAUSE)HAM: Mr. Trump, Senator Cruz is known for opposing deals, you literally wrote the book on making them. Senator Cruz has mentioned that on the trail. What would you say to those conservatives that are concerned that a deal maker will just perpetuate the same deals in Washington and the way that things run now (INAUDIBLE)...TRUMP: ... No, a good deal maker will make great deals, but well do it the way our founders thought it should be done. People get together, they make deals. Ronald Reagan did it with Tip ONeil very successfully, you didnt hear so much about executive orders, if you heard about it at all. You have to be able to get a consensus.Now, the real person like it was mentioned about the deal with Iran, how bad a deal is that? It doesnt get any more amateurish than that. A good deal maker would never make a deal like that. With Congress, you have to get everybody in a room, and you have to get them to agree. But, you have to get them to agree what you want, and thats part of being a deal maker. You cant leave the White House, go to Hawaii and play golf for three weeks and be a real deal maker. It doesnt work that way. You have to get people in, grab them, hug them, kiss them, and get the deal done. But, its got to be the deal that you want.(APPLAUSE)HAM: Governor Kasich, is the problem with Washington that there are too many deals, or too few?KASICH: Well, right now the deals  theres no leadership. I mean, a lot of the things that were talking about here tonight, on the border, and so many of the things. What we should be doing on foreign policy, you know what the problem is, Mary Katharine? Theres not a leader that gets somebody to rise.You have to have a leader that can inspire, and actually some of what Donald was saying is true. Look, do you know how hard it was...TRUMP: Some?KASICH: ... to get the balance the federal budget balanced? You have to plead with people. To do what weve done in Ohio, you have to plead with people, then you go back down to Washington and do the same thing.See, we have to remind people were Americans before were Republicans and Democrats, and when we wait, and when we delay what we end up doing, Mary Katharine, is we make the United States weaker. In fact, its a foreign policy issue because people look at America not solving problems and they say what are they doing over there? The point is you have to work with people.TRUMP: The problem with executive authority for the president, its really bad news for this reason. Since hes given up on working with Congress, he thinks he can impose anything he wants. Hes not a king. Hes a president. An executive order should be used frankly in consolidation and with consulting with the leadership in the  in the Congress.Ive done it in Ohio. I consult. I could use executive orders, but I dont trump the legislature, because if you do, you aggravate them, you anger them and then the long-term prospects get bleak. We have to solve problems in America by coming together, Republicans and Democrats, Americans first, party and ideology second  in the second back seat of this country. Thats what we need to do.(APPLAUSE)And we can do it. And we can do it.BUSH: This is a  this is an important subject. I agree with everything thats been said here about repealing unconstitutional rules and rules that are creating real burdens for investing that creating jobs.But we also ought to get back to being a Tenth Amendment country, as well, a country that respects the states to be able to make more decisions. And in the Bush administration, we would shift transportation dollars back to the states. I trust Kasich and Christie to build the roads and the infrastructure of their states than Washington, D.C.EPA delegated authority, back to the states. Education dollars, back to the states. I would like to see reform take place all across the country, where theres more vouchers, more freedom.(APPLAUSE)If we did that, we would shrink governments power in Washington, D.C. and we would have a much more effective government, where people would begin to trust our government again, because now, no one believes it works.KASICH: Mary Katherine, let me just say this to you.(APPLAUSE)You must have an agenda that you are ready to move on in the first 100 days. Jeb is right. If you delay and you wait, the Washington operators will take you down. I can tell you this, in the first 100 days, I will have legislation to freeze federal regulations, have them reviewed by the vice president, reduce state taxes on individuals, reduce taxes on corporations, have a fiscal plan to balance the budget, get the border protected and begin to fix Social Security in the first 100 days.So, anybody who is here tonight, if I get elected president, head out tomorrow and buy a seat belt, because theres going to be so much happening in the first 100 days, its going to make your head spin. Were going to move America forward. I promise you. Were going to move us forward.(APPLAUSE)BUSH: You mentioned me. He mentioned me. One other thing that I think we ought to do, along with repealing Obamacare, we need to shift all of this power of healthcare, which is the most egregious form of federal power that is suppressing wages and incomes, and allow governors to have the Medicaid plans so that they can create 21st century Medicaid insurance for people that are stuck in poverty. Theres so much that can be done, but I dont trust Washington to do it. I trust the state capitals to be the place  to be the source of innovation and reform in this country.(APPLAUSE)HAM: Thank you, governors. Martha and David, back to you.MUIR: Mary Katherine, thank you.We want to turn to something the governor of New Hampshire said...(LAUGHTER)KASICH: Jeb mentioned me. Time for me to go again.BUSH: I didnt mention him the second time.KASICH: He says he didnt mention me the second time. I thought I heard it, Jeb. No. Im just kidding. Thank you all very much for listening and being patient with all of us tonight. Thank you.MUIR: A connection here on the stage. Were going to move on to what the governor of New Hampshire said just this week, and that is that heroin overdose is not the second-leading cause of death in this state. You dont need me to tell you that. But theres another number, 48 percent of the people here in this state knows someone who has abused heroin.Josh, who covers this for WMUR, has the next question.MCELVEEN: Youre all aware, candidates, this is a major problem here in New Hampshire. Its a very deadly problem as well. Last month, New Hampshire senators Kelly Ayotte, Republican, and Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat, they went down to Washington, along with the police chief of the states largest city to testify before the Judiciary Committee in D.C.Senator Cruz, youre a member of that committee. Your campaign schedule didnt allow you to attend this. Even so, the police chief called your absence outrageous, given the severity of the problem. Last week, though, you told a personal story of a close family members struggle with addiction. What can you say to law enforcement right now to convince them that you understand the severity of this problem and youre not just saying what people want to hear days before the primary?CRUZ: Well, Josh, as you noted, this is a problem that, for me, I understand first-hand. My older sister, Myriam, who was my half- sister, struggled her whole life with drug and alcohol addiction. My father and her mom divorced when she was a little girl and she was angry her whole life, and she ended up marrying a man who had been in and out of jail. She then became a single mom and she herself went to jail several times and she ended up spending some time in a crack house. CRUZ: I still remember my father and me driving up to get Myriam out of that crack house to try to convince her she needed to be a mom to  to my nephew Joey.She wasnt willing to listen. She was not willing to change the path she was on. She was angry. I was  had just gotten my first job coming out of law school. I took a $20,000 loan on a credit card to put my nephew, Joey, in Valley Forge Military Academy  he was in sixth grade at the time, to pay his way through that.And about five, six years ago, Miriam died of an overdose. It was  the coroner ruled it accidental. We dont know. She went to one night, had taken too many pills, and Joey walked in and found her dead.This is an absolute epidemic. We need leadership to solve it. Solving it has to occur at the state and local level with programs like A.A., and counseling, and churches and charities. But it also has to be securing the borders, because you have got Mexican cartels that are smuggling vast amounts of heroin into this country.We know how to secure the borders. What is missing is the political will to do it.And as president, I will secure the border, we will end this deluge of drugs that is flowing over our southern border and that is killing Americans across this country.MCELVEEN: And Governor Christie, you have talked a lot about this issue here in New Hampshire.(APPLAUSE)MCELVEEN: State reforms, criminal justice reforms, access to treatment.To Senator Cruzs point, lets take it a step further. Would you be willing to engage in cross-border enforcement into Mexico, a place where law enforcement in New Hampshire has traced at lot of this supply back to. Would you engage in cross-border enforcement without the cooperation without the Mexican government?CHRISTIE: Of course I would. As a former United States attorney who spent seven years of my life fighting this on the streets of my state, I would do that. But we need to do more. And let me tell you what weve done in New Jersey, Josh. We are working with the folks in New Hampshire in their legislature right now to show them how were helping to solve this problem in New Jersey.Not just for this campaign  three years ago, I proposed a law that we signed into effect, which said that anyone who was a non- violent, non-dealing, first-time drug offender no longer goes to prison in New Jersey. They go to mandatory, in-patient drug treatment.What has happened is, crime has gone down 20 percent in those years. The prison population has gone down 10 percent. Weve now closed the state prison  closed a state prison, and were turning it into a drug rehabilitation facility, so people can get the tools they need.Listen, everyone out there knows this in New Hampshire. This is a disease. Its not a moral failing, its a disease. And we need to get people the treatment they need. And let me tell you why. Because Im pro-life.And Im pro life not just for the nine months in the womb, Im pro-life for when they get out and its a lot more complicated.(APPLAUSE)Sixteen-year-old, heroin-addicted drug girl on the floor of the county lockup, Im pro-life for her life. The 42-year-old lawyer who is taking Oxycontin and cant get out of bed and support his family  Im pro-life for his life. Everyone of those lives is an individual gift from God.And the last thing is this. These efforts weve taken over the last three years, 2015 in New Jersey, for the first time in four years, drug overdose deaths have gone down, not up.Ill bring the same solutions to the country.(APPLAUSE)MCELVEEN: Governor Christie, thank you very much.David, Martha, back to you.RADDATZ: Thank you, Governor Christie. Thank you, Josh.Our partner in this debate, the Independent Journal Review, has collected questions from some prominent conservatives around the country.Heres a videotaped question from radio host Larry OConnor.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OCONNOR: In 2008, we saw how motivated an electorate can be when they think their vote is making history. Lets face it: if Hillary Clinton is the nominee for the Democrats, youll be running against the prospect of the first woman president.How will you change that narrative and motivate the electorate behind your candidacy?(END VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Well...RADDATZ: Mr. Trump, Im going to give that question to you. You took it  you took it away anyway.TRUMP: Yes. OK, good. It looked like he was looking right at me, right there.I think that  I look at whats going on, I look at all of the polls, I do very, very well against Hillary Clinton. I can tell you, Im the last person that she wants to run against.And I think you can see what weve done in terms of galvanizing. Ive been all over the country. Were  last night, I was in South Carolina, we had 12,000 people. It set up in about four days. We have galvanized and weve created a movement. A lot of it has to do with  as an example, Joshs question on drugs.Im the first person that said, Build a wall. But I mean, a real wall, not a toy wall like they have right now. A real wall. And youll solve lots of problems.But we will galvanize the people of this country, and we will beat Hillary Clinton. Because  assuming that she runs, by the way, how she gets away with the e-mail stuff is hard to believe. So, I dont know that shes going to be running. But on the assumption she runs...(APPLAUSE)I mean, look. And speaking of that, if she runs, shes running for one reason. Shes going to be able to run for one reason, and thats because the Democrats are protecting her. Because so many people have done so much less than her, and they were absolutely  their lives have been destroyed.TRUMP: But on the assumption they do protect her, I will win the election and we will win it by a lot. We will win it handily. We cannot have another four years of essentially Barack Obama.(APPLAUSE)RADDATZ: Thank you, Mr. Trump.Im going to go to Senator Rubio on this. How would you change that narrative?RUBIO: I think its already happening. Look at the turnout in Iowa. A historic number of people came out and voted in those caucuses. There are saying the same thing is going to happen here in New Hampshire. Look at the rallies that every single person on this stage is having. Much higher numbers than you used to see in the past and here is why.Because people are starting to understand, very clearly, that this election is going to be a turning point. That 2016 is not just a choice between Republican or Democrat. It is a referendum on our identity as a nation and as a people.So here is what Hillary Clinton needs to understand. Were going to have our primary, were going to have our debates  which by the way, are twice as many as the Democrats have been willing to have themselves. But were going to bring this party together and we are going to defeat Hillary Clinton, because she is unqualified to be the president of the United States of America.She put classified information on her computer because she thinks shes above the law and anyone who lies to the families of people who have lost their loved ones in the service of our country like she did in Benghazi, can never be the commander-in-chief of the United States of America.(APPLAUSE)RADDATZ: Thank you, Senator Rubio. Dr. Carson, I want to go to you on Larry O Connors question. Would you change the narrative?CARSON: Its the same question?RADDATZ: Yes.CARSON: Yes. Well, first of all, I think it would be a pretty easy contrast, quite frankly, between myself and Hillary Clinton. In one case, you have someone who is known as a deceitful individual. An individual who at Benghazi, which I will never let go, quite frankly, because I think of those two men who went up there on the top of that compound with machine guns, firing away, allowing their colleagues to escape.And Im sure, in the back of their mind, they were just saying, if we can just hold on, help is on the way. But help was not on the way. When did we in the United States not send people to help our own people? You know, this is not who we are.(APPLAUSE)CARSON: And  I would simply make it a referendum on honesty and integrity versus deceit and the Washington way.MUIR: Martha?RADDATZ: Thank you very much Dr. Carson. Im going to go back to David.MUIR: Governor, well come to you in the next segment.When we come back, questions about race, about our veterans and social issues what younger conservative voters are now saying as we continue with New Hampshire with the Republican debate, right here on ABC.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)ANNOUNCER: Live from St. Anselm College in New Hampshire, here again are David Muir and Martha Raddatz.MUIR: Welcome back to New Hampshire, ABC News coverage of the Republican debate, and its great to have you back at the podiums, and we want to turn to race in America.And Mr. Trump, there are many who argue cell phones and smartphones are just now exposing whats been happening in this country for years. Cases of excessive force against minorities.As you know, Mr. Trump, on the other side, the FBI director recently said theres a chill wind blowing through law enforcement because of increased scrutiny. You have said police are the most mistreated people in America. As president, how do you bridge the divide? TRUMP: Well, there is a divide, but I have to say that the police are absolutely mistreated and misunderstood, and if there is an incident, whether its an incident done purposely  which is a horror, and you should really take very strong action  or if it is a mistake, its on your news casts all night, all week, all month, and it never ends.The police in this country have done an unbelievable job of keeping law and order, and theyre afraid for their jobs, theyre afraid of the mistreatment they get, and Im telling you that not only, me speaking, minorities all over the country, they respect the police of this country and we have to give them more respect.They cant act. They cant act. Theyre afraid for losing their pension, their job. They dont know what to do. And I deal with them all the time. We have to give great respect, far greater than we are right now, to our really fantastic police.(APPLAUSE)MUIR: Great. Mr. Trump, I did ask about bridging the divide though as president. So what would you say to the American families who say we have lived through this, we have seen excessive force? What would you say to those people?TRUMP: Well, they do. And, you know, they sue. Everybody sues, right? They see excessive  I mean, they go out, they sue. We have so much litigation  I see the courts, I see what theyre doing. They sue, and you know what? We dont want excessive force. But at what point  you know, either youre going to have a police force that can do its job...I was just up in Manchester, I met with the police officers yesterday. Tremendous people. They love the area, they love the people, they love all the people. They want to do their job. And youre going to have abuse and youre going to have problems, and youve got to solve the problems and you have to weed out the problems. But the police in this country are absolutely amazing people.KASICH: David, David...MUIR: I do want to ask  Governor Kasich?KASICH: I wanted  I wanted to say, look, this  there can be a win-win here. I have formed a collaborative between police and community leaders because people have to respect law enforcement. A family doesnt want dad or mom going home in a box. And for our community leaders, many of them think the system not only works  not only doesnt work for them, but it works against them.And I created a big collaborative in Ohio made up of law enforcement, community leaders, the head of my public safety and a former Democrat, liberal Senate senator Nina Turner, run it. They got together, they made recommendations on recruiting, on hiring, on the use of deadly force and what were about to do is to bring community and police together so we can have a win-win.We need more win-wins in America and we dont have to pick one over another divide. We love the police, but weve got to be responsible to the people in the community. We have to do all of that.(APPLAUSE)MUIR: Governor, thank you. Senator Rubio, I want to ask you next, President Obama visited a mosque this week in America for the first time in his presidency. President George W. Bush visited a mosque after September 11th. You said of President Obama, quote, hes always pitting people against each other. So Im curious, how are the two visits different, and would you visit a mosque as president?RUBIO: I would. But thats not  the issue  my problem with what he did is he continues to put out this fiction that theres widespread systematic discrimination against Muslim Americans.First of all, lets recognize this. If you go to a national cemetery in this country, you will see stars of Davids and crosses, but you see crescent moons. There are brave men and women who happen to be Muslim Americans who are serving this country in uniform and who have died in the service of this country. And we recognize that and we honor that. But by the same token, we face a very significant threat of home grown violent extremism.We need to have strong, positive relationships in the Islamic communities in this country so they will identify and report this activity, especially mosques, for example, that are participating not just in hate speech, but inciting violence and taking acts against us.And I do believe it is important also to recognize, you want to talk about religious discrimination in America. Well, I dont think Barack Obama is being sued by any Islamic groups, but he is being sued by the Little Sisters of the Poor. We are facing in this country Christian groups and groups that hold traditional values who feel and in fact are being discriminated against by the laws of this country that try to force them to vie to violate their conscience.(APPLAUSE)MUIR: Senator Rubio, thank you. Martha?RADDATZ: Governor Christie, earlier this week, the World Health Organization declared the Zika virus a global emergency. The same kind of mosquitoes that carry the Zika virus in Latin America are found here in the United States, and the virus has been linked to severe birth defects.Governor Christie, at the peak of the Ebola outbreak in west Africa, you ordered an American nurse who landed at Newark Airport be detained and quarantined. As fear spreads now of the Zika virus and with the Rio Olympics just months away, is there a scenario where you would quarantine people traveling back from Brazil to prevent the spread in the United States? CHRISTIE: You bet I would. And the fact is that because I took strong action to make sure that anyone who was showing symptoms  remember what happened with that nurse. She was showing symptoms and coming back from a place that had the ebola virus active and she had been treating patients. This was not just some  like, we picked up her just for the heck of it, alright?We did it because she was showing symptoms, and the fact is thats the way we should make these decision. You make these decisions based upon the symptoms, the medicine, and the law. We quarantined her, she turned out to test negative ultimately after 48 hours, and we released her back to the State of Maine.But, I want to add something on the issue of mosques. Now, Im the only one up here whos had a law enforcement background as a U.S. Attorney after September 11th. I went to mosques throughout my state to build bridges. To build bridges between our community in law enforcement so we can get intelligence and information from these folks.Ive had the experience of working with them as Governor of New Jersey as well. We cannot nix (ph) the radical Islamic jihadist with everyday Muslim-Americans. New Jersey is the second largest Muslim- American population in America, of any state. These are good, law abiding, hard working people. What they need is our cooperation, and our understanding. They do not just need broadsides against them because of the religious faith they practice.RADDATZ: Governor Christie, thank you.(APPLAUSE)RADDATZ: Im going to move to Dr. Carson, and go back to the Zika virus, is that going too far, quarantining? Youre a doctor, what would you do?CARSON: Well, you know, its not a simple issue, and now, you know, weve gotten evidence that there can been active viruses in other bodily fluids like saliva and urine. So, this is going to be, obviously, a big deal.Do we quarantine people? If we have evidence that they are infected, and that there is evidence that that infection can spread by something that theyre doing, yes. But, just willy-nilly going out and quarantining a bunch of people because theyve been to Brazil, I dont believe that thats going to work. What we really need to be thinking about is how do we get this disease under control?And this is where we need rapid response. We need a rapid response for ebola, we need rapid response for Zika, there will be other things that will come up. These are the kinds of things that the NIH, the CDC, can be very effective in. We need to give the the appropriate support for those kind of things.RADDATZ: Thanks very much, Dr. Carson.I want to move on to the military. Senator Rubio, all restrictions on women in combat as long as they qualify. Positions including special operations forces, like Navy Seals. Just this week military leaders of the Army and Marine Corps said that they believed young women, just as young men are required to do, should sign up for Selective Service in case the Draft is reinstated.Many of you have young daughters. Senator Rubio, should young women be required to sign up for Selective Service in case of a national emergency?RUBIO: First, let me say there are already women today serving in roles that are like combat. That, in fact, whose lives are in very serious danger, and so I have no problem whatsoever with people of either gender serving in combat so long as the minimum requirements necessary to do the job are not compromised. But, I support that, and obviously now that that is the case I do believe that Selective Service should be opened up for both men and women in case a Draft is ever instituted.I think the more fundamental challenge were now facing is whats happening to the U.S. military  Ive said this many times, and I think its important to start paying attention to this. Our Air Force is about to be the smallest its been in 100 years. Im sorry, in our history. Our Army is set to be smaller than its been since the second World War, and our Navy is about to be the smallest than its been in 100 years.I think we need to begin to refocus on rebuilding our military because every time we have cut our military in the history of this country we have had to come back later and rebuild it, and it costs more, and its a lot more chaotic and dangerous. When Im president, we are rebuilding the U.S. military.(APPLAUSE)RADDATZ: Thank you, Senator Rubio. Governor Bush, do you believe that young women...BUSH: ... Say it again?RADDATZ: Do you believe young women should sign up for Selective Service, be required to sign up...BUSH: ... I do, and I do think that we should not impose any kind of political agenda on the military. There should be  if women can meet the requirements, the minimum requirements for combat service they ought to have the right to do it. For sure. It ought to be focused on the morale as well. We got to make sure that we have readiness much higher than we do today. We need to eliminate the sequester which is devastating our military.We cant be focusing on the political side of this, we need to realize that our military force is how we project our word in the world. When were weak militarily it doesnt matter what we say. We can talk about red lines, and ISIS being the J.V. team, and reset buttons and all this. If we dont have a strong military than no one fears us, and they take actions that are against our national interest.RADDATZ: Tell me what youd say to American people out there...(APPLAUSE)RADDATZ: ... Who are sitting at home, who have daughters, who might worry about those answers, and might worry...BUSH: ... Why would they worry about it...RADDATZ: ... if the Draft is reinstituted?BUSH: ... Well, the Drafts not going to be reinstituted, but why  if women are accessing...RADDATZ: ... Are you saying youd do away with it?BUSH: No. I didnt say that. You  you asked a question not about the draft, you asked about registering. And if women are going to be...RADDATZ: You register for the draft.BUSH: If  but...RADDATZ: If its reinstituted.BUSH: ... we dont have a draft. Im not suggesting we have a draft. What Im suggesting is that we ought to have readiness being the first priority of our military, and secondly, that we make sure that the morale is high. And right now, neither one of those are acceptable because weve been gutting the military budget.We also need to reform our procurement process. We need to make sure there are more men and women in uniform than people  than civilians in our Defense Department. Theres a lot of things that we need to reform to bring our defense capabilities into the 21st century and Im the guy that could do that. Thats why I have the support of generals, of admirals, of 12 Medal of Honor recipients and many other people that know that I would be a steady commander-in-chief and rebuild our military.(APPLAUSE)CHRISTIE: Martha?RADDATZ: Thank you very much.CHRISTIE: Can I  can I be really  can I be really clear on this, because I am the father of two daughters. One of them is here tonight. What my wife and I have taught our daughters right from the beginning, that their sense of self-worth, their sense of value, their sense of what they want to do with their life comes not from the outside, but comes from within. And if a young woman in this country wants to go and fight to defend their country, she should be permitted to do so.Part of that also needs to be part of a greater effort in this country, and so theres no reason why one  young women should be discriminated against from registering for the selective service. The fact is, we need to be a party and a people that makes sure that our women in this country understand anything they can dream, anything that they want to aspire to, they can do. Thats the way we raised our daughters and thats what we should aspire to as president for all of the women in our country.(APPLAUSE)RADDATZ: Thank you very much, Governor Christie.CARSON: Can I say something...RADDATZ: We just covered  wait one second, Dr. Carson.CARSON: Something about the draft. Very quickly.RADDATZ: Very quickly.CARSON: You know, 14 percent decrease in the number of people applying for voluntary military service, and I think part of it is because of the way that we treat our veterans. You know, we wouldnt be a free country if it wasnt for them, and we have 22 veterans per day committing suicide.So, I think what we should do is have an external support system for people once they volunteer and it should follow them throughout their career, should follow them for three years, five years afterwards, a year before they get out, should be working on integrating them back into society, so that they quit on Friday and they start their new job. They should have health empowerment accounts that are subsidized so they can go to any medical facility and be taken care of. They can go to a V.A. if they want to.But if we start taking care of our veterans the right way, we wont have to ever worry about a draft again.(APPLAUSE)RADDATZ: Thank you very much for bringing up that subject, Dr. Carson, of our veterans.And for another question about our veterans, we go back to Josh McElveen from WMUR. Josh?MCELVEEN: Thank you, Martha. None of you on stage tonight have ever worn a uniform as a member of the armed services. Thats the reality of it. But as commander-in-chief, youll also be charged with the care of 23 million active duty service members and veterans in this country.Some have suggested privatizing the V.A. as a way to enhance care and increase the quality of the care and access. Others say that veterans should carry I.D. cards that allow them access to any hospital or health care provider. Governor Bush, what specifically would you do to ensure that those who have sacrificed for us are cared for?BUSH: I totally agree that we need to give veterans more choices. A veterans card to be able to go to a private provider will enhance the quality of the service inside the Department of Veterans Affairs. We need career civil service reform. Only three people were fired after waiting lists were dropped where veterans didnt get care and people died. It is outrageous. And Hillary Clinton says that thats acceptable? Because she is captive of the public service uniforms.Career civil service reform would allow the next president to fire people that are  that are showing sheer incompetence. At a town hall meeting today, someone came  told a story of their father who looked like he was 85. He had  he got a bill eight years later from an operation he had, eight years it took. They couldnt resolve the dispute and then he was told that he died. Literally, the Veterans Administration sent a death certificate to this guy and it took nine months to clarify the guy  I met him. Hes voting for me. And he is  likely to be alive.(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)This is  this is outrageous. It is completely outrageous. So, giving veterans more choices, creating centers of excellence, focusing on the true problems that exist. Dr. Carson is completely right. We need to start focusing on this earlier, before they become veterans so that theres a customized plan so people dont fall through the cracks. We can do this, but its going to require someone who has proven leadership skills to make it happen.(APPLAUSE)KASICH: Josh?MCELVEEN: Governor Kasich, do you have a favored approach?KASICH: Josh, I mean, clearly, when a veteran comes home, they should get health care anywhere they want to go. In our state, which is what we should do in the country, you know, if they drive a truck from Kabul to Kandahar in Afghanistan, we say, you can drive a truck from Columbus to Cleveland, and you dont have to go get a license. Were going to hand you one.And if youve got expertise in the military, were going to give you college credit or community college credit for the things that you did for our country. And in addition to that, Ill tell you, one of the biggest things I think has to be done  and I would do it as president  the Pentagon has got to work with the returning soldier, sailor, along with the family, and we  theyre the most valuable employees in the country. I call them golden employees.Everybody wants to hire a veteran. But there is a disconnect between the job openings and the veteran when the veteran comes back. The veteran is a leader. The veteran is strong. The veteran is drug free. There should be no unemployment among veterans.And if the Pentagon will work with the veterans services agencies all across this country, Josh, we can get people jobs and we can get them jobs quickly, get them their health care...(BELL RINGS)... get them their college education. Lets lift them. Theyre the greatest people defending the United States of America and we need to take care of them, and we will. We will.(APPLAUSE)MCELVEEN: Senator Rubio, go ahead?RUBIO: Well, my brothers a veteran. Were very proud of him in our family. He served as a green beret in the 7th Special Forces from 1968 through 1971. And as part of his training, he jumped out of an airplane and he lost his two front teeth.And for years, hes had to go to get these dental claims. And every times he goes to get one of these dental claims filled, the V.A. asks him, well, how do we know you lost your teeth in the Army? And he says, well, its the only time I ever jumped out of a plane.(LAUGHTER) But hes had to fight through this process, and Ive watched it firsthand. Thats why Im proud that I worked in a bipartisan way. We passed the V.A. Accountability bill that, for the first time, allows us to fire  allows the V.A. secretary to fire someone whos not doing a good job, whos a senior executive.And the governors right. Theyve only fired three people up to now. More people will be fired if Im president. But the portability part of it is incredibly important.Veterans should be able to take their V.A. benefits to any hospital or any doctor they want to go to. When I am president of the United States, veterans will be able to take their benefits to any hospital or doctor that they choose.(APPLAUSE)MCELVEEN: Senator Rubio, thanks very much. Going to move forward now. David, Martha, back to you.MUIR: Josh, thank you. I want to turn to a family that New Hampshire voters know quite well, and Senator Cruz, the issue of hostages has been a very real and painful one here in this state.As we all know, James Foley was killed. His mother, Diane, said our government should be willing to negotiate, arguing that families should also be allowed to raise money for ransom. What would you say to Diane Foley tonight? Should families be allowed to raise money for ransom for their loved ones?CRUZ: Well, look, I recognize it is an agonizing experience when anyone is facing a loved  loved member whos been kidnapped. But at the same time, putting in place legal regimes that encourage the payment of ransom has the effect of putting a bounty on other Americans. There is a reason it has been longstanding U.S. policy that we dont negotiate with terrorists, we dont pay ransoms.If you look at what President Obama has done over and over again, whether it was the James Bergdahl deal, which was absolutely shameful, releasing five senior Taliban terrorists to bring Bergdahl back, or whether it was this recent deal with Iran, where, again, up to 21 terrorists or potential terrorists were  were released or not prosecuted in order to bring back four Americans, what that does  does is it effectively puts a bounty on American servicemen and women serving abroad, on American tourists traveling abroad.And the proper approach...(BELL RINGS)... is a president and commander in chief that defends this country and that goes after  goes after the terrorists, rather than showing them weakness and encouraging them to target more Americans.MUIR: Senator Cruz, thank you. Mr. Trump, what would you say to Diane Foley? Should families be allowed to raise money for ransom? TRUMP: Well, I  I know Diane Foley very well. Her husband and  these are tremendous people. I spoke for them, I raised a lot of money for the foundation. I fully understand, James, one of  that was really the first that we saw, really visually saw  it was so horrible.And I will tell you, though, with all of that being said, you can not negotiate this way with terrorists. If you do, you are going to have many, many more James Foleys.James Foley was a great young man. His parents are incredible people. Theyve done such a good job, since his  since his death. But you just cannot negotiate that way with terrorists, or youre gonna have so many other James Foleys.And one thing on the vets  during the last debate, I raised $6 million for the vets, and I will tell you something... (APPLAUSE)MUIR: ... I will tell you that I think nobody here, nobody on this stage, gets along with the veterans groups in New Hampshire better than I do without ball (ph) to sarel (ph) and all of the people that I deal with and these are great people.The one thing that were not mentioning, theres tremendous fraud, waste and abuse in the Veterans Administration and if Im running things, thats going to disappear...(BELL RINGS)... and its going to disappear quickly.(APPLAUSE)MUIR: Mr. Trump, thank you.We want to turn now to social issues and young voters and for the question, from Mary Katherine.HAM: Thank you David.Senator Rubio. One of the lazier pieces of political conventional wisdom is that so-called social issues are hurting Republicans with young people. But on the two most prominent social issues, polling with millennials actually moves in different directions.On one hand, it is clear, young people across the political spectrum increasingly favor same sex marriage. However young voters have not moved to the left on abortion. In fact, large numbers of them favor at least some modest restrictions that conservatives have supported. How do you speak to millennials on both these issues, while Democrats will inevitable charge intolerance and extremism?RUBIO: Well, first of all, I dont believe that believing in traditional marriage the way I do makes you a bigot or a hater. It means that you believe that this institution thats been around for millenial is an important cornerstone of society. I respect people that believe differently. But I believe deeply, that marriage should be between one man and one woman.(APPLAUSE) RUBIO: On the issue of life, to me, the issue of life is not a political issue. Its a human rights issue and its a difficult issue, because it puts in conflict two competing rights. On the one hand is the right of a woman to choose what to do with her body which is a real right.And on the other hand is the right of an unborn human child to live. And theyre in conflict. And as a policy maker, I must choose which one of these two sides takes precedence. And I have chosen to err on the side of life.Heres what I find outrageous. There has been five Democratic debates. The media has not asked them a single question on abortion and on abortion, the Democrats are extremists. Why doesnt the media ask Hillary Clinton why she believes that all abortion should be legal, even on the due date of that unborn child.Why dont they ask Hillary Clinton why she believe that partial- birth abortion, which is a gruesome procedure that has been outlawed in this country, she thinks thats a fundamental right. They are the extremists...(BELL RINGS)... when it comes to the issue of abortion and I cant wait to expose them in a general election.(APPLAUSE)HAM: Governor Bush? I want to come to you. Your allies have recently attacked Senator Rubio for being too pro-life to be elected in November. You made a similar charge stating it in an interview. This is a pro-life party. Do you stand behind that criticism?BUSH: Look, Im pro-life. In fact, on this stage, Im the most pro-life person because Ive acted on it for eight years as governor of the state of Florida.(APPLAUSE)BUSH: Where we abolished partial-birth abortion, where parents have the right to be notified when their teenage child is having an abortion. We were the first state to do a choose life license plate to raise money for adoption. We were the first state to have state monies go to crisis pregnancy centers, which recently was just increased to $4 million a year.We created greater regulation on abortion clinics, where there were horrific procedures. So Im pro life, but I believe there should be exceptions: rape, incest and when the life of the mother is in danger. And so, that belief, and my consistency on this, makes me, I think, poised to be in the right place, the sweet spot for a Republican nominee. And others may have a different view and I respect it.(APPLAUSE) BUSH: But I think we have to be cognizant of the fact theres a lot of people that are concerned about having a pro-life position without any exceptions.(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: I do support protection for the life of the mother because Im pro-life. I just believe deeply that all human life is worthy of protection of our laws. If Im president and theres a bill thats passed that saves lives but it has exceptions, Ill sign it.But I do believe deeply that all human life is worthy of the protection of laws. Ive already said, for me, the issue of life is not a political issue and I want to be frank. I would rather lose an election than be wrong on the issue of life.(APPLAUSE)HAM: Governor Christie. You too, have talked about Senator Rubios position on the life issue. Some conservative activists have called this line of attack harmful to the pro-life cause.CHRISTIE: Well, Ive been pretty helpful to the pro-life cause in one of the most pro-choice states in the union. Ive stood up for the first time and now for the last six years weve de-funded Planned Parenthood, not talked about it like they do in Washington D.C.But for six years as governor, Planned Parenthood does not receive that funding from the state budget anymore; over $50 million worth of money thats been saved now, that is not going to do exactly what Hillary Clinton wants to have done and has advocated for.She believes that organization, which engages in the systematic murder of children in the womb, in order to maximize the value of their body parts for sale on the open market, is an acceptable position.Let me tell you something, I dont care if you are a millennial or whether you are in your 90s, no one is for that type of activity, unless you are the most radical type of extremist on this issue, like Senator Clinton and her party is on this issue.CHRISTIE: Ill say one other thing. The fact is, that I believe that if a woman has been raped, that is a birth and a pregnancy that she should be able to terminate. If she is the victim of incest  this is not a womans choice. This is a woman being violated.And the fact is that we have always has believed, as has Ronald Reagan, that we have self-defense for women who have been raped and impregnated because of it, or the subject of incest and been impregnated for it.That woman should not have to deliver that child if they believe that violation is now an act of self-defense by terminating that pregnancy.HAM: Thank you, all. Back to you, David and Martha.(APPLAUSE)MUIR: Mary Katherine, thank you.Were going to have closing statements here in just a moment, but before we go, quick lightning round. Come November, two battle-ground states, but they face off tomorrow in the Super Bowl.Governor Kasich, who wins?(LAUGHTER)KASICH: Carolinas going to win that one. I hate to say it. But theyre going to win that one.MUIR: Governor Bush?BUSH: Peyton Manning is supporting me. And Im for Denver.(LAUGHTER)MUIR: Senator Rubio?RUBIO: Well, I was going for Peyton Manning, but now Im rooting for Carolina.(LAUGHTER)MUIR: (inaudible) Mr. Trump?TRUMP: Carolina.CRUZ: With an eye to February 20th, Carolina.MUIR: All right, Dr. Carson?CARSON: With 100 percent certainly, I will predict the winner  it will either be Denver or Carolina.MUIR: Yeah. Governor Christie, the last word?CHRISTIE: Denver.MUIR: Denver. Thank you so much, gentlemen.Closing statements in just a moment, right here, as the ABC News Republican debate continues from New Hampshire, right after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MUIR: We welcome you back. The New Hampshire primary, of course, is Tuesday, but time now for closing statements. And we begin tonight with Governor Kasich.KASICH: Well, folks, Ive done now over 100 town hall meetings and Ive loved every second of it. It has been the greatest thing in the world. And I want you to know that youve changed me, because Ive listened to your stories and Ive had your hugs and Ive seen your tears, and Ive seen you walk away and say, I now have hope.You know, Ive had a conservative message, but a positive message  not just a conservative message, but a positive message about how we can bring people together, how we can restore Americas strength, lift everyone. New Hampshire, please give me a chance to carry this message forward to the United States of America. And then, I will come back. Thank you, loved it. And God bless you.(APPLAUSE)RADDATZ: Governor Christie.CHRISTIE: Thank you. Ive spent the last 13 years of my life focused on one thing: serving the people who have given me the opportunity to serve them. Not about politics, not about partisanship, but putting the people of my state and our country first. CHRISTIE: Im proud to have rebuild my state after Hurricane Sandy, and Im incredibly proud to be on this stage tonight with these men asking for your vote.New Hampshire, I spent 70 days here with you. Youve gotten to know my heart. My heart is to help you solve the problems of your state...(BELL RINGING)CHRISTIE: ... and the problems of our nation. If you give me your vote on Tuesday I will do just that.(APPLAUSE)MUIR: Governor Bush.BUSH: I want to thank the people of New Hampshire, and I want to celebrate the birthday of a great president, Ronald Reagan would have been 105 today.(APPLAUSE)BUSH: President Reagan believed in the future of our country, believed in its greatness, had a hopeful, optimistic message. Drew people towards our cause. We need someone who has a proven record to take our case to the American people because our philosophy is by far the best one. Limited government, entrepreneurial capitalism, of peace through strength. I believe I have the skills to take our party to victory in November.I ask for your support on Tuesday to keep America, and make America a safer, stronger, and freer. Thank you all very much.(APPLAUSE)RADDATZ: Dr. Carson.CARSON: For many months, the political class, pundits, the media, have tried to ignore or bury me. They say that politics is too complex, and too sleazy. You cant survive. Well, guess what? Im still here, and Im not going any place either.And, I believe there is still a place in our country for faith, integrity, and common sense. Hundreds of thousands of you drafted me to run for president... (BELL RINGING)CARSON: ... And, I am going to with the help of God, and you, once again place the American people at the pinnacle with the government there to serve it.(APPLAUSE)MUIR: Thank you, Dr. Carson. Senator Rubio.RUBIO: Thank you. You know, this week I had the great pleasure of having my kids join me on the campaign trail. I hadnt seen them in a while, and it was great to have them alongside me, but the most important part of it is that it once again reminded me of whats at stake.Here in New Hampshire in less than 72 hours, we are literally deciding what kind of country we will be like when they are my age. What kind of country they will be able to raise their families in. And, thats why Im asking you for your vote. You vote for me, and we will unite this party, we will grow the conservative movement, we will defeat Hillary Clinton, and we will leave our children what our parents left us. The single greatest nation in the history of all mankind.Thank you.(APPLAUSE)RADDATZ: Senator Cruz.CRUZ: You know, every candidate running for president says they will stand up to Washington. The natural follow up question is when have you ever stood up to Washington.Last week we saw a powerful illustration of that. I campaigned in the state of Iowa four-square (ph) against the ethanol mandate, something everyone said was political suicide. My two leading competitors both attacked me for it. The governor of the state said vote for anyone but Cruz, and lobbyists spent millions of dollars in attack ads, but I stood and said we should have no mandates, a level playing field, and the people of Iowa put country and our children above the cronyism and corporate welfare...(BELL RINGING)CRUZ: ... We can turn this country around if we get back to the Constitution. And, I will always stand with the American people against the bipartisan corruption of Washington.(APPLAUSE)MUIR: Thank you. Mr. Trump.TRUMP: Thats because he got Ben Carsons votes, by the way, but we wont (inaudible). Our country that we love so much doesnt win anymore. We dont win with the military, we dont win on the border. You look at New Hampshire with the tremendous problem we have with heroin. Number one thing I hear from the people of New Hampshire, who I love, and developed such relationships, we dont win with healthcare. We dont win with trade.You look at what other countries are doing to us. China. Everyone, theyre killing us on trade. If Im elected president, we will win, and we will win, and we will win. Thank you, thank you very much.(APPLAUSE)MUIR: Mr. Trump, thank you. Thanks to all the candidates on the stage here tonight. We thank the people of Manchester, New Hampshire for having this debate," and to everyone at home. The New Hampshire primary is Tuesday."""
25,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/25/opinion/governors-unite-in-the-war-against-opioids.html,2/25/16,"State governments are at the front lines of the countrys epidemic of drug overdose deaths. Thats why it is important that the National Governors Association says it will come up with  protocols for dispensing prescription painkillers that are among the biggest sources of addiction and abuse in the country.The protocols, or guidelines, would restrict how and under what circumstances doctors could prescribe a category of pain drugs known as opioids. They might, for example, impose limits on how many pills doctors could prescribe to patients who have had minor surgery or dental procedures.More than 47,000 people died from drug overdoses in 2014; 61 percent of those deaths involved opioids like the prescription drug oxycodone, and illegal substances like heroin, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The rate of drug overdose deaths has increased by 140 percent since 2000, while prescriptions for opioid painkillers have quadrupled in roughly the same period. Experts say many patients who become addicted go on to use heroin and other illegal opioids.The governors associations health and human services committee is expected to present the protocols at a meeting in July. Legislators and governors in each state could then adopt those standards into their laws and regulations, which would make meaningful enforcement against excessive prescriptions more likely. Some leaders intend to act even sooner. The governors of New England states like Vermont and Massachusetts say they will work together to come up with common prescribing guidelines for their states within a few weeks.Done right, the guidelines  being developed with medical specialists, government regulators, insurance companies and other experts  should reduce the number of excessive prescriptions. Similar efforts by some states and insurance companies have shown promising results. Florida, for example, reduced its prescription drug overdose death rate by 23 percent between 2010 and 2012 after it strengthened its prescribing laws and increased enforcement against doctors who dispensed too many pills, often because it was financially lucrative. And Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts has reduced opioid use by, among other things, requiring some patients to use just one pharmacy to fill their prescriptions.On the federal front, the C.D.C. is expected to publish voluntary guidelines soon for doctors in treating chronic pain in adults. And Congress is considering a bill that would require the secretary of health and human services to convene a task force to develop best practices for prescribing painkillers.Drug companies and some doctors will push back against any limits on prescriptions enacted by state lawmakers. The American Medical Association says the decision to prescribe drugs should stay in the hands of physicians. Of course, doctors should have discretion to make medical decisions, including what drugs to use, but state governments also have a duty to protect people by placing sensible limits on the use of risky substances.Obviously, reducing the number of opioid prescriptions only addresses part of the addiction problem. Earlier this month, President Obama proposed spending $1.1 billion on treatment and prevention programs. And Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat of New Hampshire, has proposed $600 million in emergency funding to address the opioid crisis. These requests are surely reasonable, given the size of the national problem.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dr. Carson, youre first.CARSON: If someone had tried to describe todays America to you 30 years ago, you would have listened in disbelief. Americans know that our nation is heading off the abyss of destruction, secondary to divisiveness, fiscal irresponsibility, and failure to lead.Marco, Donald, Ted, John, we will not solve any of these problems by trying to destroy each other. What we need to do is be looking for solutions tonight. Its not about us, its about the American people.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Governor Kasich?KASICH: Well, you know, on the way over here, even getting ready earlier and sitting in the green room and watching the early coverage, you know, my father carried mail on his back and his father was a coal miner and my mothers mother was an immigrant, could barely speak English. And Im standing on this stage. Its pretty remarkable. But I want to tell you, theres a lot of young people watching tonight. You can do whatever you want to do in your life. America is an amazing country, where a kid like me can grow up to run for president of the United States and be on this stage tonight. So to all the young people that are out there, your hopes, your dreams, pursue them. Shoot for the stars. Americas great, and you can do it. Thank you, Wolf.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Senator Rubio?RUBIO: Well, thank you. This election, we have to decide the identity of America in the 2ist century, but as part of this primary, we have to find out our identity as a party and as a movement.Thirty-six years ago, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush began the Reagan Revolution. For a generation, they defined conservatism as limited government and free enterprise and a strong national defense. But they also appealed to our hopes and our dreams. Now we have to decide if we are still that kind of party and still that kind of movement, or if were simply going to become a party that preys on peoples angers and fears.I hope we remain that conservative movement that appeals to our hopes and our dreams and the belief that America will always be better in its future than its been in its story history.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Senator Cruz?CRUZ: Welcome to Texas.(APPLAUSE)Here, Texas provided my family with hope. Here, my mom became the first in her family ever to go to college. Here, my dad fled Cuba and washed dishes, making 50 cents an hour to pay his way through the University of Texas. I graduated from high school at Second Baptist not too far away from here. CRUZ: When I ran for Senate, I promised 27 million Texans I would fight for you every day, and not for the Washington bosses.And, Ill tell you, as I travel the state, Democrats tell me I didnt vote for you, but youre doing what you said you would do. And, as president, I will do the same.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Mr. Trump.TRUMP: Thank you. My whole theme is make America great again. We dont win anymore as a country. We dont win with trade, we dont win with the military. ISIS, we cant even knock out ISIS, and we will, believe me. We will.We dont win in any capacity with healthcare. We have terrible health care, Obamacare is going to be repealed and replaced. We just dont win.You look at our borders, theyre like swiss cheese, everybody pours in.Were going to make a great country again. Were going to start winning again. Were going to win a lot, its going to be a big difference, believe me. Its going to be a big difference.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Thank you very much. Its now time to begin questions. Voters in the first four states have spoken, and Mr. Trump has emerged as the frontrunner, but in five days the candidates will face their biggest test yet, Super Tuesday. When nearly half of the delegates needed to win the Republican nomination will be awarded, and the biggest prize of the night is Texas.Immigration is a key issue in this state, for all voters nationwide, including the many people watching us on Telemundo. So, thats where we begin.Mr. Trump, youve called for a deportation force to remove the 11 million undocumented immigrants from the United States. Youve also promised to let what you call, the good ones, come back in. Your words, the good ones, after theyve been deported.Senator Cruz would not allow them to come back in. He says thats the biggest difference between the two of you. He calls your plan amnesty. Is it?TRUMP: First of all, he was in charge of amnesty, he was the leader, and you can ask Marco because theyve been debating this every debate that weve had.As far as coming back in, number one, you wouldnt even be talking, and you wouldnt have asked that as the first question if it werent for me when my opening when I talked about illegals immigration. It wouldnt even be a big subject.But, we either have a country, or we dont have a country. We have at least 11 million people in this country that came in illegally. They will go out. They will come back  some will come back, the best, through a process. They have to come back legally. They have to come back through a process, and it may not be a very quick process, but I think thats very fair, and very fine.Theyre going to get in line with other people. The best of them will come back, but theyre going to come back through a process.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Senator Cruz, whats wrong with letting what Mr. Trump calls, the good ones come back to the United States?CRUZ: You know, the people that get forgotten in this debate over immigration are the hardworking men and women of this country  our millions of Americans who are losing their jobs. Millions of legal immigrants who are losing their jobs are seeing their wages driven down.You know, in the past couple of weeks the Wall Street Journal had a very interesting article about the state of Arizona. Arizona put in very tough laws on illegal immigration, and the result was illegal immigrants fled the state, and whats happened there  it was a very interesting article.Some of the business owners complained that the wages they had to pay workers went up, and from their perspective that was a bad thing. But, what the state of Arizona has seen is the dollars theyre spending on welfare, on prisons, and education, all of those have dropped by hundreds of millions of dollars. And, the Americans, and for that matter, the legal immigrants who are in Arizona, are seeing unemployment drop are seeing wages rise. Thats who we need to be fighting for.Listen, we have always welcomed legal immigrants, but I think it is a mistake to forgive those who break the law to allow them to become U.S. citizens, and thats why Ive led the fight against granting citizenship to those here illegally, and thats why I will do the same thing as president.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: Mr. Trump, do you want to respond to that? TRUMP: Well, Im very glad that Ted mentioned Arizona because probably the toughest man on borders is Sheriff Joe Arpaio, and two days ago he totally endorsed me, so, thank you.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Senator Rubio?RUBIO: Senator Cruz has called your immigration plan amnesty, and has an add out there comparing it to President Obamas. He says both of you support allowing undocumented immigrants legal status here in the United States after a background check, paying a fine, and paying taxes.Are those claims correct?RUBIO: Well, first of all, and before we do anything, Ive been abundantly clear on this. When Im president of the United States, before we do anything on immigration, we are going to secure the border. And, thats not just the physical border with Mexico, its Visa overstays. Thats 45 percent of the problem right there.RUBIO: It also has to do  thats why we need e-verify, and entry-exit tracking system, and so-forth. And, until that happens, were not doing anything else. And then well see what the American people are willing to support.And Donald mentioned, because he mentioned me in his answer, that his position on immigration is what has driven this debate. Well, the truth is, though, that a lot of these positions that hes now taking are new to him.In 2011, he talked about the need for a pathway to citizenship. In 2012, Donald criticized Mitt Romney, saying that Mitt lost his election because of self-deportation.And so even today, we saw a report in one of the newspapers that Donald, youve hired a significant number of people from other countries to take jobs that Americans could have filled.My mom and dad  my mom was a maid at a hotel, and instead of hiring an American like her, you have brought in over a thousand people from all over the world to fill those jobs instead.So I think this is an important issue. And I think we are realizing increasingly that its an important issue for the country that has been debated for 30 years, but finally needs to be solved once and for all.BLITZER: Mr. Trump?TRUMP: Well, first of all, self-deportation is people are going to leave as soon as they see others going out. If you look at Dwight Eisenhower in the 1950s, they started moving people out and the rest of them left.Self-deportation, as I really define it, and thats the way I define it, is youre going to get some to go, and the rest are going to go out.As far as the people that Ive hired in various parts of Florida during the absolute prime season, like Palm Beach and other locations, you could not get help. Its the up season. People didnt want to have part-time jobs. There were part-time jobs, very seasonal, 90-day jobs, 120-day jobs, and you couldnt get.Everybody agrees with me on that. They were part-time jobs. You needed them, or we just might as well close the doors, because you couldnt get help in those hot, hot sections of Florida.RUBIO: That  my point that I made was you had criticized Mitt Romney for self-deportation. You said that his strategy of self- deportation is why he lost the election.And I think people in Florida would be surprised, because, in fact, the article that was today, they interviewed a number of people that would have been willing to do those jobs, if you would have been willing to hire them to do it.TRUMP: I criticized Mitt Romney for losing the election. He should have won that election. He had a failed president. He ran a terrible campaign. He was a terrible candidate. Thats what I criticize Mitt Romney  I mean, ran...RUBIO: No, he...TRUMP: Excuse me. He ran one terrible campaign. Thats an election that should have been won.(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: Well, in fact, I agree we should have won and I wished we would have, but, in fact, you did criticize him for using the term self-deportation. I mean, thats on the record and people can look it up right now online.But, again, I just want to reiterate, I think its really important, this point. I think its fine, its an important point that you raise and we discuss on immigration. This is a big issue for Texas, a huge issue for the country.But I also think that if youre going to claim that youre the only one that lifted this into the campaign, that you acknowledge that, for example, youre only person on this stage that has ever been fined for hiring people to work on your projects illegally.You hired some workers from Poland...TRUMP: No, no, Im the only one on the stage thats hired people. You havent hired anybody.(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: In fact, some of the people...(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: And by the way, Ive hired  and by the way, Ive hired tens of thousands of people over at my job. Youve hired nobody.RUBIO: Yes, youve hired a thousand from another country...TRUMP: Youve had nothing but problems with your credit cards, et cetera. So dont tell me about that.RUBIO: Let me just say  let me finish the statement. This is important.TRUMP: You havent hired one person, you liar.RUBIO: He hired workers from Poland. And he had to pay a million dollars or so in a judgment from...TRUMP: Thats wrong. Thats wrong. Totally wrong.RUBIO: Thats a fact. People can look it up. Im sure people are Googling it right now. Look it up. Trump Polish workers, youll see a million dollars for hiring illegal workers on one of his projects. He did it.(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: That happened.TRUMP: Ive hired tens of thousands of people over my lifetime. Tens of thousands...RUBIO: Many from other countries instead of hiring Americans.TRUMP: Be quiet. Just be quiet.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: Let me talk. Ive hired tens of thousands of people. He brings up something from 30 years ago, it worked out very well. Everybody was happy.RUBIO: You paid a million dollars.TRUMP: And by the way, the laws were totally different. That was a whole different world.BLITZER: Thank you.TRUMP: But Ive hired people. Nobody up here has hired anybody.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Senator Cruz, you say you want to deport the 11 million undocumented immigrants, but you never want to allow them to come back to the United States. What would happen to the children who are U.S.- born citizens whose parent will be deported under your plan?CRUZ: Well, existing law provides that those who are deported cannot come back here legally. U.S. citizens can come back. Thats existing law.But let me say, Wolf, I really find it amazing that Donald believes that he is the one who discovered the issue of illegal immigration. I can tell you, when I ran for Senate here in the state of Texas, I ran promising to lead the fight against amnesty, promising to fight to build a wall. And in 2013, when I was fight against the gang of eight amnesty bill, where was Donald? He was firing Dennis Rodman on Celebrity Apprentice.(LAUGHTER)CRUZ: And indeed, if you look at the gang of eight, one individual on this stage broke his promise to the men and women who elected him and wrote the amnesty bill. CRUZ: If you look at the eight members of the Gang of Eight, Donald gave over $50,000 to three Democrats and two Republicans. And when youre funding open border politicians, you shouldnt be surprised when they fight for open borders.And I think if you want to know who actually will secure the borders and follow through, you ought to ask who has a record before they were a candidate for president of fighting to secure the borders and stop amnesty. And Im the only one on this stage that has that record. And by the way, Marco is exactly right that a federal court found Donald guilty of being part of a conspiracy to hire people illegally and entered a $1 million judgment against him.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Mr. Trump?TRUMP: I can only say this, and Ive said it loud and clear and Ive said it for years. And many of these people are sitting right in the audience right now  your lobbyist and your special interest and your donors, because the audience is packed with them, and theyre packed with you.Ive had an amazing relationship with politicians  with politicians both Democrat, Republican, because I was a businessman. As one magazine said, hes a world-class businessman; he was friendly with everybody. I got along with everybody.You get along with nobody. You dont have one Republican  you dont have one Republican senator, and you work with them every day of your life, although you skipped a lot of time. These are minor details. But you dont have one Republican senator backing you; not one. You dont have the endorsement of one Republican senator and you work with these people. You should be ashamed of yourself.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Senator Cruz?CRUZ: You know, I actually think Donald is right. He is promising if hes elected he will go and cut deals in Washington. And hes right. He has supported  he has given hundreds of thousands of dollars to Democrats. Anyone who really cared about illegal immigration wouldnt be hiring illegal immigrants. Anyone who really cared about illegal immigration wouldnt be funding Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi; wouldnt be funding the Gang of Eight. And, you know, he is right. When you stand up to Washington, when you honor the promise you made to the men and women who elected you and say enough with the corruption, enough with the cronyism, lets actually stand for the working men and women of this country, Washington doesnt like it.And Donald, if you want to be liked in Washington, thats not a good attribute for a president.(APPLAUSE)(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: Heres a man  Robin Hood. This is Robin Hood over here. He talks about corruption. On his financial disclosure form, he didnt even put that hes borrowed money from Citibank and from Goldman Sachs, which is a total violation. He didnt talk about the fact that he pays almost no interest. He just left it off, and now hes going to protect the people from the big bad banks.Give me a break.BLITZER: All right. Were going to move on to Governor Kasich.Governor Kasich...(CROSSTALK)CRUZ: Wolf, can I respond to that attack?BLITZER: You can respond, but let me get Governor Kasich in. Hes been waiting patiently.Governor Kasich, the idea  youve said this, and I want to quote you now: The idea that were going to deport all these people is ludicrous and everybody knows it. Those are your words. Should people be allowed to break the law just because its not feasible to stop them?KASICH: Look, we have a great president here, George Bush, the 41st president of the United States. He worked with Ronald Reagan to pass an effort to try to solve this problem  a path to legalization. You see, that was a time when things worked. It was a time when President Reagan and George Bush decided that we needed to make the country work.Look, I think there is an answer here. The answer is you complete the border. You let people know that once its done, you dont have a right to come in. If you come in, we dont want any excuse. Youre going to go back. But I favor a guest worker program. I think its practical. And I think for the 11 million or 11.5 million Americans  the illegals that are here, if they have not committed a crime since theyve been here, Id make them pay a fine, some back taxes, maybe some community service. And at the end, Id give them a path to legalization, but not a path to citizenship. I dont think were going to tear families apart. I dont think were going to ride around in peoples neighborhoods and grab people out of their homes. I dont think  first of all, I dont think its practical and I dont think it reflects America.You know what happened? The problem with President Reagan is we didnt get in there and actually finish the border. And I think it was probably business interests that affected it. But at the end of the day, lets be practical. Lets start solving problems in this country instead of kicking them upstairs. With President Reagan and George Bush, it was a bipartisan coalition to address the issue, and I think we can and should do it again. And I will have a plan in the first 100 days to get it done and get this issue behind us.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Thank you, Governor.(APPLAUSE)Dr. Carson, youve been critical of mass deportation. You said back in November you dont think Mr. Trumps plan necessarily represents the Republican Party. Given how well Mr. Trump has been doing with the Republican primary voters, do you still believe that?CARSON: I believe in liberty and justice for all. I think everything that we do should be fair. And Ive already described  you know, how we can secure the border.We need to secure all the borders, because its not just people coming in from South America and Mexico, but there are terrorists who want to destroy us, who are getting across our borders fairly easily. And we have to stop that.But in terms of the people who are here already, after we  after we stop the illegal immigration, we need to be reasonable. And I would give them a six-month period in which to get registered as a guest worker, assuming that they have an acceptable record.They have to pay a back-tax penalty, have to pay taxes going forward, but they dont have to live underground anymore. And I think they do not become American citizens, they do not vote.If they want to become an American citizen, they go through exactly the same process that anybody else goes through. I think thats the kind of situation that is actually fair to people.And we have other ways of  of utilizing our facilities and our talents as foreign aid: doing things in South America and Central America and Mexico that improve the economy there, so that they dont feel the need to come over here. That would cost us a lot less than borrowing money from China, paying interest on it.BLITZER: Thank you, Dr. Carson.(APPLAUSE)Mr. Trump, your campaign, as you well remember, began with the idea of building a wall along the southern border.TRUMP: (inaudible).BLITZER: Its about 315 miles southwest of where we are right now. Youve said the Mexican government will pay for it.TRUMP: Correct.BLITZER: The spokesperson for the current president of Mexico says that will never happen. The last two presidents of Mexico say that will never happen. In fact, the former president of Mexico, Vicente Fox  he said today, and Im quoting him  he said, Im not going to pay for that, quote, effing wall.(LAUGHTER)So if you dont get an actual check from the Mexican government for $8 billion or $10 billion or $12 billion, whatever it will cost, how are you going to make them pay for the wall?TRUMP: I will, and the wall just got 10 feet taller, believe me.(APPLAUSE)It just got 10 feet taller. I saw him make that  I saw him make the statement. I saw him use the word that he used. I can only tell you, if I would have used even half of that word, it would have been national scandal.This guy used a filthy, disgusting word on television, and he should be ashamed of himself, and he should apologize, OK? Number one. Number two, we have a trade deficit with Mexico of $58 billion a year. And that doesnt include all the drugs that are pouring across and destroying our country.Were going to make them pay for that wall. Now, the wall is $10 billion to $12 billion, if I do it. If these guys do it, itll end up costing $200 billion.(APPLAUSE)But the wall is $10 billion to $12 billion. You need 1,000  you need 1,000 miles. The Great Wall of China, built 2,000 years ago  2,000, is 13,000 miles. We need 1,000, because we have a lot of natural barriers.We can do it for $10 billion to $12 billion, and its a real wall. This is a wall thats a heck of a lot higher than the ceiling youre looking at. This is a wall thats going to work.Mexico will pay for it, because they are not doing us any favors. They could stop all of this illegal trade if they wanted to...(BELL RINGS)... immediately. Mexico will pay for the wall. Its a small portion of the kind of money that we lose and the deficits that we have with Mexico.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: If the  if the Mexicans dont pay for the wall, will you start a trade war with Mexico?TRUMP: Well, you know, I dont mind trade wars when were losing $58 billion a year, you want to know the truth. Were losing so much. (APPLAUSE)Were losing so much with Mexico and China  with China, were losing $500 billion a year. And then people say, dont we want to trade? I dont mind trading, but I dont want to lose $500 billion. I dont want to lose $58 billion.Mexico just took Carrier Corporation, maker of air conditioners. They just took Ford. Theyre building a $2.5 billion plant. They just took Nabisco out of Chicago.And I always say Im not having Oreos anymore, which is true, by the way. But they just took a big plant from Nabisco into Mexico. Theyre taking our businesses. I dont mind.BLITZER: Thank you. Senator Rubio?(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: Yeah, a couple points. If he builds the wall the way he built Trump Towers, hell be using illegal immigrant labor to do it. The second...(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: Such a cute sound bite.RUBIO: But it  no, its not a sound bite. Its a fact. Again, go online and Google it. Donald Trump, Polish workers. Youll see it.The second thing, about the trade war  I dont understand, because your ties and the clothes you make is made in Mexico and in China. So youre gonna be starting a trade war against your own ties and your own suits.TRUMP: All right, you know what?RUBIO: Why dont you make them in America?TRUMP: Because they devalue their currency  they devalue their currencies...RUBIO: Well, then make them in America.TRUMP: ... that makes it  well, you dont know a thing about business. You lose on everything...RUBIO: Well, make them in America. TRUMP: Let me just tell you  they de-value their currency. They de-value their currencies.RUBIO: Well then, make them in America.TRUMP: That makes it  well, you dont know a thing about business. You lose on everything you do.RUBIO: Well, make them in America.TRUMP: Let me just tell you, they de-value their currencies. China, Mexico, everybody. Japan with the cars. They de-value their currencies to such an extent that our businesses cannot compete with them, our workers lose their jobs...RUBIO: And so you make them in China and in Russia.TRUMP: But you wouldnt know anything about it because youre a lousy businessman.RUBIO: Well, I dont know anything about bankrupting four companies. Youve bankrupted..TRUMP: No, I  and you know why? You know why?(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: I dont know anything about...TRUMP: You know why?RUBIO: ... starting a university, and that was a fake university.BLITZER: One at a time.TRUMP: First of all...BLITZER: One at a time.TRUMP: ... first of all, thats called a...RUBIO: There are people who borrowed $36,000...BLITZER: Hold on. One at a time, Mr. Trump.RUBIO: ... to go to Trump University, and theyre suing now  $36,000 to go to a university...TRUMP: And by the way  and by the way...RUBIO: ... thats a fake school.TRUMP: ... and by the way...RUBIO: And you know what they got? They got to take a picture with a cardboard cutout of Donald Trump...TRUMP: ... Ive won most of the lawsuits.RUBIO: Thats what they got for $36,000.BLITZER: All right, I want to move on.TRUMP: And they actually did a very good job, but Ive won most of the lawsuits.BLITZER: Mr. Trump, Senator, I want to bring in...RUBIO: Most of the lawsuits.BLITZER: ... I want to bring in my colleague Maria Celeste.TRUMP: Excuse me. Hey Wolf, let me ask you. Am I allowed to respond to this?BLITZER: Youre allowed  youve been responding.TRUMP: OK. Well let  no, I havent. I really havent.(LAUGHTER)RUBIO: Hes talked through the whole thing.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: Heres a guy  heres a guy that buys a house for $179,000, he sells it to a lobbyist whos probably here for $380,000 and then legislation is passed. You tell me about this guy. This is what were going to have as president.RUBIO: Heres a guy that inherited $200 million. If he hadnt inherited $200 million, you know where Donald Trump would be right now?TRUMP: No, no, no.RUBIO: Selling watches in (inaudible)(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: (Inaudible) I took...RUBIO: Thats where he would be. TRUMP: That is so wrong. Well work on that. I took $1 million and I turned into $10 billion.RUBIO: Oh, OK. One million.TRUMP: I borrowed $1 million...RUBIO: Better release your tax returns so we can see how much money he made.TRUMP: I borrowed $1 million, I turned it into $10 billion...RUBIO: Oh, he doesnt make that money.TRUMP: ... more than $10 billion.BLITZER: Thank you. Thank you. I want to bring in Maria Celeste of Telemundo. Maria?CELESTE: Senator Rubio, last week, you said that on your first day in office, you will get rid of President Obamas executive action known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, DACA for short.RUBIO: Correct.ARRASAS: It is a program that has protected hundreds of thousands of young people that came here when they were children, brought to the U.S. by undocumented immigrants. This is the only home they know, and that is a dramatic change from last April when you said in Spanish, and Im going to quote you (in Spanish) which translates to DACA is going to have to end at some point, but it wouldnt be fair to cancel it immediately.So Senator Rubio, what changed?RUBIO: It didnt change.ARRASAS: Why is it now fair to cancel it on Day One?RUBIO: No, its the same policy. It will have to end at some moment, and as I said, we will  we will eliminate that",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
executive order. The people that are on it now will not be allowed to renew it, and new applicants will not be allowed to apply to it. And its not because were not compassionate to the plight of a 2  someone who came here when they were 2 years old. I understand. I know people that are personally impacted by this.The problem with the executive order is it is unconstitutional. The president doesnt have the power to do that.(APPLAUSE)And he himself admitted that.ARRASAS: Senator, Senator...RUBIO: Im sorry, but let me finish my...ARRASAS: ... but you went  you went from saying that it was deeply disruptive to deport them immediately to deport them on Day One.RUBIO: No, but this is not about deportation. Everybody always goes immediately to the issue of deportation. This is about DACA. DACA is an executive order that is unconstitutional. I will cancel it on my first day in office, which means people who currently hold those permits will not be allowed to renew them when they expire, and new people will not be allowed to apply for them.Now, I am sympathetic to the plight of someone who came here when they were 2 or 3 years old through no fault of their own, but you cant solve it doing something that is unconstitutional. No matter how sympathetic we may be to a cause, we cannot violate the Constitution of the United States the way this president now does on a regular basis.(APPLAUSE)ARRASAS: Senator Rubio, you accused Senator Cruz in a previous debate of lying when he said that you said one thing in Spanish and another one in English. So in what sense did he lie?RUBIO: Because it is not true that Im not going to get rid of DACA. I am going to get rid of DACA. In the Spanish interview, you just read out the transcript in Spanish, I said, it will have to end at some point. That point will be when I eliminate the executive order and the people who have those permits when they expire will not be allowed to renew it. And new people will not be able to apply. In fact, I dont even think we should be taking new enrollees in the program now.That is how the program ends and how you wind it down is you allow the people who are on it, when the program expires, they cannot renew it, and it goes away. But I will cancel the executive order as soon as I take  as soon as I step foot into the Oval Office.TRUMP: I have to say, he lied this time. He lied. 100 percent. 100 percent.RUBIO: You lied about the Polish workers.TRUMP: Yes, yes, yes. 38 years ago.RUBIO: You lied to the students at Trump University.ARRASAS: Let Senator Cruz jump in.RUBIO: Oh, he lied 38 years ago. All right, I guess theres a statute of limitation on lies.(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE) CRUZ: Well Maria, I would note you made the exact same point here that I made at the last debate, and youre right that Senator Rubio called me a liar for saying that. CRUZ: You know, weve both seen at home when Washington politicians say about an illegal, or unconstitutional program. Well, itll have to end some day, not immediately, but someday in the future.That, inevitably, is when a politician doesnt plan to end it at all.You know, Im reminded of that that is the same position that Marco took in Iowa on ethanol subsidies. When I campaigned in Iowa, I took on the lobbyists, took on the corporate welfare and said we should have no ethanol subsidies.Marcos position was the same as it is to illegal amnesty. Well, someday it should end, just not now. And, frankly, I think we need a president who knows what he believes in, is willing to say it on day one, not at the end of his term when its somebody elses problem.RUBIO: Thats not an accurate assessment of what I said about ethanol. What I said is that ethanol will phase out, it is phasing out now. By 2022 that program expires by virtue of the existing law, and at that point it will go away. I dont agree with the mandate and the program thats in place, but I think its unfair that these people have gone out and invested all this money into this program and were just going to yank it away from them.And, again, you read the statement in Spanish. I said very clearly on Spanish television, DACA will have to end at some point, and that point is  at that time I was not a candidate for president. I said it will end in my first day in office as president, and the people who have it now will not be able to renew it. New applicants will not be able to apply. That is the end of DACA.I am sympathetic to this cause, but once again, it cannot supersede the Constitution of the United States which this president habitually and routinely every single day ignores and violates.(CHEERING) (APPLAUSE)ARRASAS: Senator Cruz, you and Senator Rubio are the two candidates of hispanic descent on this stage. As a matter of fact, you are the first hispanic candidate ever to win a caucus or primary.(APPLAUSE)And yet, there is the perception in the Latino community that instead of trying to prove to Latinos who has the best plan, the best platform to help them, that you two are spending the time arguing with each other. Trying to figure out which one is tougher on immigration in order to appeal to the majority of Republicans.So, my question to you is are you missing a huge opportunity to expand the Republican base?CRUZ: Well, Maria, you are right. It is extraordinary that of five people standing on this stage that two of us are the children of Cuban immigrants. It really is the embodiment of the incredible opportunity and promise this nation provides.You know, I would note that a lot of folks in the media have a definition of hispanics that you can only be hispanic if youre liberal. That makes sense in the media, but I gotta tell you, one of the things I was most proud of when I ran for Senate here in Texas, I earned 40 percent of the hispanic vote here in Texas.At the same time, Mitt Romney was getting clobbered with 27 percent of the hispanic vote nationwide. And, the reason is, as you know, you look at the value sin the hispanic community. The values in our community are faith, family, patriotism.You know, weve got the highest rate of military enlistment among hispanics in any demographic in this country. And, when I campaigned, and I campaigned the same here in Houston or Dallas as I did in the Rio Grande Valley, defending conservative principles, defending judeo- Christian principals, telling my fathers story.Telling my Dads story of coming to America with $100 dollars in his underwear, not speaking English, washing dishes, having hopes and dreams for the American dream. And, the truth is the Obama-Clinton economy has done enormous damage to the hispanic community. It is not working in the hispanic community, and I...(BELL RINGING)CRUZ: ... fighting so that everyone who is struggling in the hispanic community and beyond will have a fair and even shake at the American dream.RUBIO: Im sorry I was mentioned...ARRASAS: ... Governor Kasich.RUBIO: Maria I was mentioned in that. I was mentioned in that statement.ARRASAS: Governor Kasich, after the...RUBIO: ... OK. I was mentioned  just because of the hispanic  and Ill be brief.A couple points, number one, I do think its amazing that on this stage tonight there are two descendants of Cuban origin, and an African American. We are the party of diversity, not the Democratic party.(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)And, the second point I would make is that we have to move past this idea that somehow the hispanic community only cares about immigration.Yes, its an important issue because we know and love people that have been impacted by it. But, Im going to tell you that the most powerful sentiment in the hispanic community, as it is in every immigrant community, is the burning desire to leave your children better off than yourself...(BELL RINGING)RUBIO: ... and, you can only do that through free enterprise. Thats what we stand for, not socialism like Bernie Sanders, and increasingly Hillary Clinton.(APPLAUSE)ARRASAS: Governor Kasich, after the last presidential election the Republican party realized that in order to win the presidency it needed the support of latinos. Guidelines as to how to accomplish that were spelled out in an autopsy (ph) report that concluded, and Im going to quote it, if hispanic Americans hear that the GOP doesnt want them in the United States they wont pay attention to our next sentence.So, do you think that your fellow Republican candidates get it?KASICH: Well, Im not going to talk about that. I mean, Ive got to tell you, I was with this little 12-year-old girl, was at a town hall meeting, and she said, you know, I dont like all this yelling and screaming at the debates. My mothers thinking I might not be able to watch the thing anymore.I think we ought to move beyond that, about what they think. Im going to tell you what I think. My position on this whole immigration issue has been clear from the beginning. I havent changed anything with it.And, look, my view is, we need economic growth. Everything starts with economic growth. And how do you get it? Common sense regulations, lower taxes for both business and individuals, and, of course, a fiscal plan that balances the budget.That gives you economic growth. I did it when I was in Washington, as the Budget Committee chairman, negotiating actually with Democrats, that gave us surpluses, economic growth, and the same thing in Ohio.But heres the thing that I believe. Economic growth is not an end unto itself. We have to make sure that everybody has a sense that they can rise.Of course, our friends in the Hispanic community, our friends in the African-American community, the promise of America is that our system, when we follow the right formula, is going to give opportunity for everyone.Its what Jack Kemp used to say. A rising tide lifts all boats, not just some boats, but all boats. And you know what? With me and the Hispanic community, I think they like me. And I appreciate that, because I want them to have the same opportunity that I and my children and my wife and the people we love have had in this country.Its time to solve problems.(APPLAUSE)ARRASAS: Dr. Carson, concerning this recommendation of the report, are you, as a candidate, getting it?CARSON: I didnt hear the first part of the question?ARRASAS: The first part of the question is, there was a report that recommended that in order to approach Hispanics and bring them to vote for the Republican Party, certain things needed to happen.And one of them was that they shouldnt feel like they were going to get kicked out of the United States, otherwise they wouldnt pay attention to one more sentence from candidates.CARSON: OK, well, first of all, let me just mention that last year at the NALEO, the National Association for Latino Elected Officials, I was the only one of 17 Republican candidates to go there.And the reason that I dont fear going to an organization like that is because the message that I give is the same message to every group. You know, this is America. And we need to have policies that are  that give liberty and justice to all people.And thats the way that I have fashioned virtually every policy, looking at that. And I think thats the way the Republican Party generally thinks. We dont pick and choose winners and losers. We are compassionate.But real compassion is providing people with a ladder of opportunity to climb up from a state of dependence and become part of the fabric of America. When we begin to emphasize that, I think we will attract everybody.(APPLAUSE)ARRASAS: Mr. Trump, it is common knowledge that the Hispanic vote is very important in this race. You keep saying that Hispanics love you.TRUMP: True.(LAUGHTER)ARRASAS: And, yes, you won the Hispanic vote in Nevada.TRUMP: True.ARRASAS: But a brand new Telemundo poll says that three out of four Hispanics that vote nationwide have a negative opinion of you. They dont like you. Wouldnt that make you an unelectable...TRUMP: No.ARRASAS: ... candidate in a general election?TRUMP: First of all, I dont believe anything Telemundo says.ARRASAS: You used to say that you love...(LAUGHTER)TRUMP: Number one. Number two, I currently employ thousands of Hispanics, and over the years, Ive employed tens of thousands of Hispanics. Theyre incredible people. They know, and the reason I won in Nevada, not only won the big one, but I also won subs, like, as an example, I won with women.I won with every single category. I won with men, I won with high-income, low-income, I won with Hispanics. And I got 46 percent. Nobody else was close. Because they know Im going to bring jobs back from China, from Japan, from so many other places.They get it. Theyre incredible people. Theyre incredible workers. They get it. And Ive won many of the polls with Hispanics. I didnt maybe win the Telemundo poll.But one thing Im also going to do, Im going to be getting  bringing a lot of people in who are Democrats, who are independents, and youre seeing that with the polls, because if you look at anywhere, look at any of the elections, every single election, it has been record-setting.And the good news is, for the Republican Party, the Democrats are getting very poor numbers in terms of bringing them in. Were getting record-setting numbers. I think I have something to do with that.TRUMP: Were getting record-setting numbers. And I won every one  the three of them that I won, I won with record-setting numbers.TRUMP: New people are coming into the Republican Party. We are building a new Republican Party, a lot of new people are coming in.(APPLAUSE)ARRASAS: For the record, you have said publicly that you loved Telemundo in the past. But it is not just a Telemundo poll. We have...TRUMP: I love them. I love them.(APPLAUSE)ARRASAS: All right. Well, its not the only poll.TRUMP: Theyre fine. Do you know what? Theyre fine.ARRASAS: Just last night  let me  let me finish, please.Just last night, The Washington Post showed that 80 percent of Hispanic voters in their polls have a negative view of you. And concerning the Nevada victory, allow me to explain that the poll in Nevada was based on a tiny sample, statistically insignificant of only about 100  let me finish please  of 100 Hispanic Republicans in the state of Nevada.TRUMP: Why did they take the poll? Why did they...(CROSSTALK)ARRASAS: I am making reference  I am making reference to Hispanic voters nationwide in a general election.TRUMP: Im just telling you, Im doing very well with Hispanics. And by the way, I settled my suit, as you know, with Univision. It was settled. Were good friends now. It was all settled up.(LAUGHTER)Very happy, very happy. Very good people.Im just telling you  Im just telling you that I will do really well with Hispanics. I will do better than anybody on this stage. I have respect for the people on the stage, but I will do very well with Hispanics. But Im telling you also, Im bringing people, Democrats over and Im bringing independents over, and were building a much bigger, much stronger Republican Party.BLITZER: Mr. Trump, thank you.I want to turn our attention now to another critically important issue for the American people, the United States Supreme Court, where filling the vacancy left by the late Justice Antonin Scalia has become a major campaign issue. I want to bring in Salem Radio Network host, Hugh Hewitt.Hugh?HEWITT: Thank you, Wolf.To me, its the most important issue. Ill start with you, Senator Cruz. Do you trust Mr. Trump to nominate conservative justices?CRUZ: Well, Hugh, I agree with you that it  Justice Scalias passing underscores the enormous gravity of this election. Justice Scalia was someone I knew personally for 20 years; was privileged to be at his funeral this weekend. And with his passing, the court is now hanging in the balance. We are one liberal justice away from a five-justice radical leftist majority that would undermine our religious liberty; that would undermine the right to life; and that would fundamentally erase the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms from the Constitution.Now, I think the voters of Texas, the voters across Super Tuesday are assessing everyone standing on this  this stage. In the past, Republican presidents always promise to nominate strict constitutionalists. So Im certain if you took a survey, everyone would say they would do that.But the reality is, Democrats bat about 1,000. Just about everyone they put on the court votes exactly as they want. Republicans have batted worse than 500, more than half of the people we put on the court have been a disaster.Ive spent my whole life fighting to defend the Bill of Rights and the Constitution. I can tell you, for voters that care about life or marriage or religious liberty or the Second Amendment, theyre asking the question: Who do you know, beyond a shadow of a doubt, who do you know will nominate principled constitutionalists to the court? I give you my word, every justice I nominate will vigorously defend the Bill of Rights for my children and for yours.(APPLAUSE)HEWITT: Mr. Trump, Senator Cruz mentioned the issue that keeps me up at night, which is religious liberty. Churches, Catholic and Christian colleges, Catholic adoption agencies  all sorts of religious institutions fear that Hobby Lobby, if its repealed, it was a five-four decision, theyre going to have to bend their knee and provide morning-after pills. They fear that if Bob Jones is expanded, they will lose their tax exemption.Will you commit to voters tonight that religious liberty will be an absolute litmus test for anyone you appoint, not just to the Supreme Court, but to all courts?TRUMP: Yes, I would. And Ive been there. And Ive been there very strongly. I do have to say something, and this is interesting and its not anybodys fault. Its not Teds fault. Justice Roberts was strongly recommended and pushed by Ted. Justice Roberts gave us Obamacare. Might as well be called Roberts-care. Two times of the Supreme Court, Justice Roberts approved something that he should have never raised his hand to approve. And we ended up with Obamacare.That is a rough thing. And I know Ted feels badly about it. And I think he probably still respects the judge. But that judge has been a disaster in terms of everything we stand for because there is no way  no way that he should have approved Obamacare.Now, with that being said, these are the things that happen. But Ted very, very strongly pushed Judge Roberts, and Justice Roberts gave us something that we dont want.HEWITT: Ted Cruz, Senator, the chief justice got Hobby Lobby right, but what do you make of Mr. Cruzs criticism?CRUZ: Well, listen  Donald knows that it was George W. Bush who appointed John Roberts. Yes, its true, I supported the Republican nominee once he was made.But I would not have nominated John Roberts. I would have nominated my former boss, Mike Luttig, who was the strongest proven conservative on the court of appeals. And Ill tell you, Hugh...(APPLAUSE)... you know, its interesting now that Donald promises that he will appoint justices who  who will defend religious liberty, but this is a man who, for 40 years, has given money to Jimmy Carter, to Joe Biden, to Hillary Clinton, to Chuck Schumer, to Harry Reid.Nobody who supports far-left liberal Democrats who are fighting for judicial activists can possibly care about having principled constitutionalists on the court.And what Donald has told us is he will go to Washington...(BELL RINGS)... and cut a deal.HEWITT: Mr. Trump...CRUZ: So that means on Supreme Court...HEWITT: ... can I...CRUZ: ... hes going to look to cut a deal, rather than fight for someone who wont cut a deal on the Constitution, but will defend it faithfully.(APPLAUSE)HEWITT: Can I trust you on religious liberty?TRUMP: Well, let  let me  let me just say  let me just say this. Look, I watched Ted  and I respected it, but he gets nowhere  stand on the Senate floor for a day or two days, and talk and talk and talk.I watched the other senators laughing and smiling. And when Ted was totally exhausted, he left the Senate floor, and they went back to work. OK? We have to have somebody thats going to make deals.Its wonderful to stand up for two days and do that. Now, Teds been very critical  I have a sister whos a brilliant...HEWITT: Mr. Cruz, will you make a deal about religious liberty?TRUMP: ... excuse me. Shes a brilliant judge. Hes been criticizing  hes been criticizing my sister for signing a certain bill. You know who else signed that bill? Justice Samuel Alito, a very conservative member of the Supreme Court, with my sister, signed that bill.So I think that maybe we should get a little bit of an apology from Ted. What do you think?HEWITT: Let me  Senator.CRUZ: Let me tell you right now, Donald, I will not apologize for a minute for defending the Constitution. I will not apologize for defending the Bill of Rights.(APPLAUSE)And I find it amazing that your answer to Hugh and to the American people is, on religious liberty, you cant have one of the these crazy zealots that actually believes in it. Youve got to be willing to cut a deal.And you know, there is a reason why, when Harry Reid was asked, of all the people on this stage, who does he want the most, who does he like the most, Harry Reid said Donald  Donald Trump.Why? Because Donald has supported him in the past, and he knows he can cut a deal with him.(BELL RINGS)You know what, Donald...(CROSSTALK)HEWITT: Senator Rubio.CRUZ: ... I dont want a Supreme Court justice that you cut a deal with Harry Reid to undermine religious liberty, because that same justice will also erase the Second Amendment from the Bill of Rights.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: When you say crazy zealot, are you talking about you? Crazy zealot  give me a break.HEWITT: Senator Rubio, youve heard this exchange on religious liberty. You have said that religious liberty will trump even the ability of people to stay away from same-sex marriages, not provide flowers, not provide baked goods, et cetera. Are you satisfied with this exchange on religious liberty?RUBIO: Well, I think you ask a very important question, because the issue here  the next president of the United States has to fill this vacancy.Justice Scalia  in the history of the republic, there has never been anyone better than him at standing for the principle that the Constitution is not a living and breathing document  it is supposed to be applied as originally meant.And the next president of the United States has to be someone that you can trust and believe in to appoint someone just as good as Scalia  plus there may be at least two other vacancies.So you ask Mr. Trump to respond and say that he would, and he says that he would. But the bottom line is, if you look at his record over the last 25 or 30 years, on issue after issue, he has not been on our side.Now, if hes changed, were always looking for converts into the conservative movement. But the bottom line is that, if (ph) you dont have a record there to look at and say, I feel at peace that when Donald Trump is president of the United States, hes going to be firmly on our side on these issues.In fact, very recently, he was still defending Planned Parenthood. He says hes not going to take sides in the Palestinians versus Israel. These are concerning things.And so, yes, I have a doubt about whether Donald Trump, if he becomes president, will replace Justice Scalia with someone just like Justice Scalia.HEWITT: Mr. Trump?(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: Well, let  let me just say  let me just say, first of all, I have great respect for Justice Scalia. I thought he was terrific. And if you talk about evolving, Ronald Reagan was a somewhat liberal Democrat. Ronald Reagan evolved into a somewhat strong conservative  more importantly, he was a great president. A great president.As far as Planned Parenthood is concerned, Im pro-life. Im totally against abortion, having to do with Planned Parenthood. But millions and millions of women  cervical cancer, breast cancer  are helped by Planned Parenthood.So you can say whatever you want, but they have millions of women going through Planned Parenthood that are helped greatly. And I wouldnt fund it.I would defund it because of the abortion factor, which they say is 3 percent. I dont know what percentage it is. They say its 3 percent. But I would defund it, because Im pro-life. But millions of women are helped by Planned Parenthood.(APPLAUSE)HEWITT: Governor Kasich, back to religious liberty. Youve been a little bit less emphatic. Youve said, same-sex couple approaches a cupcake maker, sell them a cupcake. Can we trust you as much on religious liberty as the rest of these people? KASICH: Well, you know, , of course. I mean, if  look, I was involved in just being a pioneer in a new church. Religious institutions should be able to practice the religion that they believe in. No question and no doubt about it.Now, in regard to same-sex marriage, I dont favor it. Ive always favored traditional marriage, but, look, the court has ruled and Ive moved on. And what Ive said, Hugh, is that, look, where does it end?If youre in the business of selling things, if youre not going to sell to somebody you dont agree with, OK, today Im not going to sell to somebody whos gay, and tomorrow maybe I wont sell to somebody whos divorced.I mean, if youre in the business of commerce, conduct commerce. Thats my view. And if you dont agree with their lifestyle, say a prayer for them when they leave and hope they change their behavior.But when it comes to the religious institutions, they are in inviolate in my mind, and I would fight for those religious institutions. And look, Ive appointed over a hundred judges as governor. I even appointed adjudge to the Ohio Supreme Court.And you know what they are? Theyre conservatives. Go check it out. They are conservatives. They dont make the law. They interpret the law. Thats all they do. And they stick by the Constitution. So I will do that.But lets just not get so narrow here as to gotcha this or that. I think my position is clear.HEWITT: Dr. Carson, let me wrap it up with you. Are their positions clear?(APPLAUSE)HEWITT: Are the positions youve heard clear about the First Amendment and the first freedom?CARSON: Well, first of all, let me just add my praise to Justice Scalia. I first met him when we got an honorary degree together a long time ago. A tremendous wit and intellect.As far as religious freedom is concerned, one of the basic tenets of this nation, and I believe that the Constitution protects all of our rights. And it gives people who believe in same-sex marriage the same rights as everybody else.But what we have to remember is even though everybody has the same rights, nobody get extra rights. So nobody gets to redefine things for everybody else and then have them have to conform to it. Thats unfair.And this is the responsibility of Congress to come back and correct what the Supreme Court has done. Thats why we have divided government. And were going to have to encourage them to act in an appropriate way, or we will lose our religious freedom.And as president, I would go through and I would look at what a persons life has been. What have they done in the past? What kind of judgments have they made? What kind of associations do they have? That will tell you a lot more than an interview will tell you.The fruit salad of their life is what I will look at.BLITZER: Thank you, Dr. Carson.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: All of you want to repeal and replace Obamacare, so lets talk about your plans, specific plans to replace it. I want to bring in our chief political correspondent, Dana Bash.BASH: Senator Rubio, you said yesterday, right here in Houston, that Mr. Trump thinks part of Obamacare is pretty good. So, he says he is going to repeal Obamacare. Are you saying that youre worried he wont?RUBIO: The individual mandate. He said he likes the individual mandate portion of it, which I dont believe that should be part of it. That should not remain there. I think heres what we need to replace it with.We need to repeal Obamacare completely and replace it with a system that puts Americans in charge of their health care money again. If your employer wants to buy health insurance for you, they can continue to do so from any company in America they want to buy it from.Otherwise, your employers can provide you health care money, tax- free, not treated as income, and you can use that money only for health care, but you can use it to fund health care any way you want, fully fund a health savings account, the combination of a health savings account or a private plan from any company in any state in the country.And if you dont have that, then you will have a refundable tax credit that provides you health care money to buy your own health care coverage. And that, I think, is a much better approach than Obamacare, which, by the way, isnt just bad for health care, its bad for our economy. It is a health care law that is basically forcing companies to lay people off, cut peoples hours, move people to part-time. It is not just a bad health care law, it is a job-killing law. And I will repeal it as president and we will replace it with something substantially better for all Americans.(APPLAUSE)BASH: Mr. Trump, Senator Rubio just said that you support the individual mandate. Would you respond?TRUMP: I just want to say, I agree with that 100 percent, except pre-existing conditions, I would absolutely get rid of Obamacare. Were going to have something much better, but pre-existing conditions, when Im referring to that, and I was referring to that very strongly on the show with Anderson Cooper, I want to keep pre- existing conditions.I think we need it. I think its a modern age. And I think we have to have it.(APPLAUSE)BASH: OK, so lets talk about pre-existing conditions. What the insurance companies say is that the only way that they can cover people is to have a mandate requiring everybody purchase health insurance. Are they wrong?TRUMP: I think theyre wrong 100 percent. What we need  look, the insurance companies take care of the politicians. The insurance companies get what they want. We should have gotten rid of the lines around each state so we can have real competition. TRUMP: We thought that was gone, we thought those lines were going to be gone, so something happened at the last moment where Obamacare got approved, and all of that was thrown out the window.The reason is some of the people in the audience are insurance people, and insurance lobbyists, and special interests. They got  Im not going to point to these gentlemen, of course, theyre part of the problem, other than Ben, in all fairness.And, actually, the Governor too, lets just talk about these too, OK?(LAUGHTER)TRUMP: Because I dont think the Governor had too much to do with this.But, we should have gotten rid of the borders, we should have gotten rid of the lines around the state so theres great competition. The insurance companies are making a fortune on every single thing they do.Im self-funding my campaign. Im the only one in either party self-funding my campaign. Im going to do whats right. We have to get rid of the lines around the states so that theres serious, serious competition.BASH But, Mr. Trump...TRUMP: ... And, youre going to see  excuse me. Youre going to see preexisting conditions and everything else be part of it, but the price will be done, and the insurance companies can pay. Right now theyre making a fortune.(APPLAUSE)BASH: But, just to be specific here, what youre saying is getting rid of the barriers between states, that is going to solve the problem...TRUMP: Thats going to solve the problem. And, the insurance companies arent going to say that, they want to keep it. They want to say  they say whatever they have to say to keep it the way it is. I know the insurance companies, theyre friends of mine. The top guys, theyre friends of mine. I shouldnt tell you guys, youll say its terrible, I have a conflict of interest. Theyre friends of mine, theres some right in the audience. One of them was just waving to me, he was laughing and smiling. Hes not laughing so much anymore.Hi.(APPLAUSE)Look, the insurance companies are making an absolute fortune. Yes, they will keep preexisting conditions, and that would be a great thing. Get rid of Obamacare, well come up with new plans. But, we should keep preexisting conditions.RUBIO: Dana, I was mentioned in his response, so if I may about the insurance companies...BASH: ... Go ahead.RUBIO: You may not be aware of this, Donald, because you dont follow this stuff very closely, but heres what happened. When they passed Obamacare they put a bailout fund in Obamacare. All these lobbyists you keep talking about, they put a bailout fund in the law that would allow public money to be used, taxpayer money, to bail out companies when they lost money.And, we led the effort and wiped out that bailout fund. The insurance companies are not in favor of me, they hate that. Theyre suing that now to get that bailout money put back in.Heres what you didnt hear in that answer, and this is important guys, this is an important thing. What is your plan? I understand the lines around the state, whatever that means. This is not a game where you draw maps...TRUMP: ... And, you dont know what it means...RUBIO: ... What is your plan, Mr. Trump?(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: What is your plan on healthcare?TRUMP: You dont know.BASH: (inaudible)TRUMP: ... The biggest problem...(CROSSTALK)RUBIO: ... Whats your plan...TRUMP: ... The biggest problem, Ill have you know...RUBIO: ... Whats your plan... TRUMP: ... You know, I watched him meltdown two weeks ago with Chris Christie. I got to tell you, the biggest problem hes got is he really doesnt know about the lines. The biggest thing weve got, and the reason weve got no competition, is because we have lines around the state, and you have essentially....RUBIO: ... We already mentioned that (inaudible) plan, I know what that is, but what else is part of your plan...TRUMP: ... You dont know much...RUBIO: ... So, youre only thing is to get rid of the lines around the states. What else is part of your healthcare plan...TRUMP: ... The lines around the states...RUBIO: ... Thats your only plan...TRUMP: ... and, it was almost done  not now...RUBIO: ... Alright, (inaudible)...TRUMP: ... Excuse me. Excuse me.RUBIO: ... His plan. That was the plan...TRUMP: ... You get rid of the lines, it brings in competition. So, instead of having one insurance company taking care of New York, or Texas, youll have many. Theyll compete, and itll be a beautiful thing.RUBIO: Alright...(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: So, thats the only part of the plan? Just the lines?BASH: (inaudible)TRUMP: The nice part of the plan  youll have many different plans. Youll have competition, youll have so many different plans.RUBIO: Now hes repeating himself.TRUMP: No, no, no.(LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)TRUMP: (inaudible)RUBIO: (inaudible)(CHEERING)TRUMP: (inaudible) I watched him repeat himself five times four weeks ago... RUBIO: ... I just watched you repeat yourself five times five seconds ago...(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: I watched him meltdown on the stage like that, Ive never seen it in anybody...BASH: ... Lets stay focused on the subject...TRUMP: ... I thought he came out of the swimming pool...RUBIO: ... I see him repeat himself every night, he says five things, everyones dumb, hes gonna make America great again...BASH: ... Senator Rubio...RUBIO: ... Were going to win, win win, hes winning in the polls...BASH: ... Senator Rubio, please.RUBIO: ... And the lines around the state.(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: ... Every night.BASH: Senator Rubio.(CHEERING)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I tell the truth, I tell the truth.BASH: Senator Rubio, you will have time to respond if you would just let Mr. Trump respond to what youve just posed to him...RUBIO: ... Yeah, hes going to give us his plan now, right? OK...BASH: ... If you could talk a little bit more about your plan. I know you talked about...TRUMP: ... Were going to have many different plans because...BASH: ... Can you be a little specific...TRUMP: ... competition...RUBIO: ... Hes done it again.(CHEERING) (APPLAUSE)TRUMP: There is going to be competition among all of the states, and the insurance companies. Theyre going to have many, many different plans. BASH: Is there anything else you would like to add to that...TRUMP: No, theres nothing to add.(CHEERING) (APPLAUSE)TRUMP: What is to add?BASH: Thank you. Thank you both.RUBIO: Alright.BASH: Governor Kasich, youve said it is, quote, Un American to deny someone health insurance if they have a preexisting condition.BASH: Would you leave the individual mandate in place requiring all Americans to purchase insurance?KASICH: No, I wouldnt. And  but that doesnt matter when it comes to the issue of preexisting conditions. You dont want any American to lose their house, everything theyve saved, because they get sick. Now, I think it is more complicated than what weve heard here tonight. Were actually running significant health reform in my state.I would repeal Obamacare for a variety of reasons. I would take some of the federal resources, combine it with the freed-up Medicaid program, which I would send back to the states, and cover the people who are currently the working poor because we dont want to have tens of millions of Americans losing their health insurance.And then were driving towards total transparency. If any of you here ever get a hospital bill, its easier to interpret the Dead Sea scrolls than to understand your hospital bill. The fact is what we need is transparency with hospitals and with the providers.And Ill tell you what we will do. We are actually going to make payments to physicians and to hospitals who actually deliver healthcare with great quality at low prices. We actually are going to make the market work.BASH: Governor, let me just go back to the original question about the individual mandate. In 1994 when you were in Congress, you proposed a plan requiring an individual mandate. So what changed?KASICH: Well, Dana, the Heritage Foundation had this position as well. And when I look at it, I dont think its tenable. And we dont need to do that. Again, Im telling you that we are going to  we have a proposal, a plan that were enacting now that says if you are a hospital or a doctor and youre providing very high quality at lower prices, below the midpoint  some charge high, some charge low. If you are below the midpoint, we are going to give you a financial reward for allowing you to provide services that result in high quality for our people at lower pricess.That is the way in which we are going to damp down the rising costs of healthcare. Because if you think about your own deductibles today, theyre going higher, higher and higher. And you know what? At some point, people cant afford it. Our plan will work. It uses the market. It uses transparency. It gets the patient in the middle. And guess what? Were actually doing it in my state, the seventh-largest state in the country. And if this will go  this will go national, we will get our hands on healthcare where you will know whats going on. We will pay for quality, lower prices, and we will begin to see healthcare become affordable in America and where people will also be able to have health insurance, even if they have a preexisting condition.We dont want to throw millions of people out into the cold and not have the health insurance, Dana. So thats really what were doing. This is not a theory. This is what we are actually doing in our state. We will begin payments next year based on episodes that we have in our lives. If our primary care physicians keep us healthy for a year, with really high quality, guess what? They will get a financial reward.Our primary care physicians need help. They need support. Were losing them. This will allow them to get a reward for doing a great job.BASH: Governor Kasich, thank you.KASICH: Thank you.(APPLAUSE)BASH: Dr. Carson, you have dealt with the sickest of patients. You support covering preexisting conditions. How would you change Obamacare, but maintain that coverage?CARSON: Well, first of all, healthcare is not a right. But I do believe it is a responsibility for a responsible society, and we are that. We spend almost twice as much per capita on healthcare as many other nations who have actually much better access than we do.I propose a system in which we use health empowerment accounts, which are like a health savings account with no bureaucrats. And we give it to everybody from birth until death. They can pass it on when they die. We pay for it with the same dollars that we pay for traditional healthcare with. We give people the ability to shift money within their health empowerment account within their family. So dads $500 short, mom can give it to him or a cousin or uncle.And it makes every family their own insurance carrier with no middle man. It gives you enormous flexibility. And also, you know, if Uncle Joe is smoking like a chimney, everybodys going to hide his cigarettes because theyre all interested in whats going on there.Also, the  your catastrophic healthcare is going to cost a lot less money now because the only thing coming out of that is catastrophic healthcare. So, its like a homeowners policy with a large deductible, versus a homeowners policy where you want every scratch covered. One costs $1,500 a year; one costs $10,000 a year. You can buy the $1,500 one. That will take care of 75 percent of the people. The people who are indigent, how do we take care of them now? Medicaid. Whats the Medicaid budget? Almost $500 billion; almost 80 million people participate, which is way too many, and that will get a lot better when we fix the economy, which I hope we get a chance to talk about.CARSON: But do the math. Over $5,000 for each man, woman and child, and all  they will have a lot more flexibility. What could you buy with that? A concierge practice.BLITZER: Thank you.CARSON: And you could still have thousands of dollars left over. And let me just finish, because I dont get to talk that much. And, you know, lets...(APPLAUSE)... you can have the money thats left over to buy your catastrophic insurance. But most importantly, we give them a menu, just like we do in Medicare Part C, and they have the choices that will allow them not only to have catastrophic health care, but drug care and everything else.It will be such a good program that nobody will want Obamacare after that, and thats probably the best way do it, although if anybody still did, I would still de-fund it.BLITZER: Thank you.(APPLAUSE)Thank you, Dr. Carson. Lets talk about the economy. Lets talk about...CRUZ: Wolf, Wolf, Wolf. Does everyone get to address Obamacare but me?BLITZER: I want to move on, but therell be plenty of opportunities for you to address...CRUZ: Its kind of an issue I have a long history with.BLITZER: I know you do. And  all right, go ahead.(LAUGHTER)CRUZ: Thank you, Wolf.KASICH: How do you  how do you get that extra time, Cruz? Youre very good at... CRUZ: You know, this is another issue on which Donald and I have sharp disagreements. On Planned Parenthood, he thinks Planned Parenthood is wonderful. I would instruct the Department of Justice to investigate them and prosecute any and all criminal violations.(APPLAUSE)On Obamacare, both Donald and I say we want to end it, but for very different reasons. I want to end it because it goes too far, its killed millions of jobs, and its hurting peoples health care. Donald wants to end it because he says it doesnt go nearly far enough. And what was amazing in that exchange that was missing is for decades Donald has been advocating socialized medicine.What hes said is government should pay for everyones health care, and in fact, a couple of debates ago, he said, if you dont support socialized health care, youre heartless. Now, liberal Democrats have been saying that for years. Now let me tell you if youre a small business owner, Donald Trumps socialized medicine, putting the government in charge of your health care would kill more jobs than Obamacare, and if youre elderly, the results of socialized medicine in every country on earth where its been implemented has been rationing, has been the government saying, no, you dont get that hip replacement, you dont get that knee replacement, the government is in charge of your health care.Ill tell you this. As president...BLITZER: Senator...CRUZ: ... I will repeal every word of Obamacare.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Thank you, thank you. Mr. Trump?TRUMP: I do not want socialized medicine, just so you understand. He goes around saying oh, he wants it. I do not want socialized medicine. I do agree with him that its going to be a disaster, Obamacare, for the economy.In 2017, it will be impossible for us to pay for it if you look at whats going on. Thats why it has to be repealed, for a lot of reasons, Number one, it doesnt work, number two, premium. You look at premiums going up,25,35, even 45 percent, and more. We have to get rid of Obamacare. It is going to destroy our economy completely. Our economy is not doing well. It is going to destroy our economy greatly. And on that, I agree.CRUZ: Donald, true or false, youve said the government should pay for everyones health care.TRUMP: Thats false.CRUZ: Youve never said that?TRUMP: No, I said it worked in a couple of countries...CRUZ: But youve never stood on this debate stage and says it works great in Canada and Scotland and we should do it here.TRUMP: No, I did not. No I did not.CRUZ: Did you say if you want people to die on the streets, if you dont support socialized health care, you have no heart.TRUMP: Correct. I will not let people die on the streets if Im president.CRUZ: Have you said youre a liberal on health care?TRUMP: Excuse me. Let me talk. If people...CRUZ: Talk away. Explain your plan, please.TRUMP: If people  my plan is very simple. I will not  were going to have private  we are going to have health care, but I will not allow people to die on the sidewalks and the streets of our country if Im president. You may let it and you may be fine with it...CRUZ: So does the government pay for everyones health care?TRUMP: ... Im not fine with it. We are going to take those people...CRUZ: Yes or no. Just answer the question.TRUMP: Excuse me. We are going to take those people and those people are going to be serviced by doctors and hospitals. Were going to make great deals on it, but were not going to let them die in the streets.CRUZ: Who pays for it?RUBIO: Well, can I just clarify something?BLITZER: Gentleman, please.RUBIO: Wolf, no. I want to clarify something.BLITZER: Gentlemen please. I want to move on.RUBIO: This is a Republican debate, right? Because that attack about letting people die in the streets...BLITZER: I want to talk about the economy.(CROSSTALK)BLITZER: Gentleman, gentleman. All of you have agreed  Senator Cruz...TRUMP: You know what? Call it what you want.CRUZ: Its a yes or no.TRUMP: Call it what you want, people are not going to be dying on the sidewalk.BLITZER: All of you have agreed  all of you have agreed to the rules. I want to move on. Were talking about the economy right now. Mr. Trump, you want to cut taxes more than President Ronald Reagan did, more than President George W. Bush did. The Independent Tax Foundation says the cost to the country of your proposal would be about $10 trillion, and that takes into account the economic growth that would emerge from your proposed tax cuts.How would you cut $10 trillion over 10 years, but make sure the country isnt saddled with even more debt? TRUMP: Because the country will become a dynamic economy. Well be dynamic again. If you look at whats going on, we have the highest taxes anywhere in the world. We pay more business tax, we pay more personal tax. We have the highest taxes in the world.Its shutting off our economy. Its shutting off our country. We have trillions of dollars outside that we cant get in. Yes, we will do my tax plan, and it will be great. We will have a dynamic economy again.BLITZER: What specific cuts will you make to pay for that tax cut?TRUMP: Were going to make many cuts in business. Were getting rid of  were going to get rid of so many different things. Department of Education  Common Core is out. Were going local. Have to go local.(APPLAUSE)Environmental protection  we waste all of this money. Were going to bring that back to the states. And were going to have other (inaudible) many things. (APPLAUSE)We are going to cut many of the agencies, we will balance our budget, and we will be dynamic again.BLITZER: Mr. Trump  Mr. Trump. If you eliminate completely the Department of Education, as you have proposed, thats about $68 billion. If you eliminate the Environmental Protection Agency, thats about $8 billion. Thats about $76 billion for those two agencies.The current deficit this year is $544 billion. Where are you going to come up with the money?TRUMP: Waste, fraud and abuse all over the place. Waste, fraud and abuse.(APPLAUSE)You look at whats happening with Social Security, you look  look at whats happening with every agency  waste, fraud and abuse. We will cut so much, your head will spin.BLITZER: Governor Kasich.(APPLAUSE)When you were in Congress, you were chairman of the Budget Committee. You helped craft the last balanced budget the United States had. Can Mr. Trumps plan work?KASICH: Well, I think it takes three things, Wolf. And Ive done it. I mean, I  we got the budget balanced. We cut the capital gains tax. You see, in order to get this economy moving again, you have to grow the economy, and you have to restrain the spending.And when I was chairman, we cut that capital gains tax and we instituted a significant program to get to balance. We had a balanced budget four years in a row, had to take on every interest group in Washington  every single one of them  and we paid down a half a trillion of the national debt.And why do you do it? Because you want job growth. If you dont have regulatory reform, common-sense regulations, reasonable tax cuts, which I have, and a fiscal plan, you wont get there. You will never be able to do it.Now, I  I inherited an an $8 billion hole in Ohio, I have common-sense regulations, I have tax cuts  the biggest of any governor in the country  and we have a fiscal plan.And its not all  its not always cutting. Its innovating  its producing a better product at, frankly, a lower price. Now we have a $2 billion surplus. Our credit is strong, our pensions are strong.And, look  Ive got a plan to take to Washington, and I will have it there in the first hundred days, and it will include shifting welfare, education, transportation, Medicaid and job training back to us, so we can begin, in the states, to be the laboratories of innovation.Ive done it  I did it in Washington  four years of balanced budgets. No one could even believe it happened.(BELL RINGS)Ive done it in Ohio, were growing, the jobs are up and people are having opportunity. And I will go back to Washington and do it again for the American people. I promise you that.(APPLAUSE)Within the first hundred days, we will have the plan to get this done.BLITZER: Thank you. Thank you, governor.(APPLAUSE)Speaking of taxes...TRUMP: I just want to say  and Im a big fan of the governor, but they also struck oil, OK, so that helped Iowa a lot.KASICH: OK, let me  let me  let me just talk about that, because I know that  that Donald believes the energy industry is important. So do I. But of the over 400,000 jobs that weve created in the state, we think maybe 15,000 are connected to this industry, because its early-stage.See, what weve done in Ohio, and what a president needs to do, is to have a cabinet and a whole operation thats jobs-friendly. We have diversified our economy.We  we do have energy, we have medical devices, we have financial services, we have I.T., we just got Amazon  their Cloud computing in the Midwest. You know why its happening?(BELL RINGS)Because were balanced budgets, were strong, were job-friendly, we dont raise their taxes, and if we have a president that does that in America, we will get the economic growth, and that is what this country needs. Jobs, jobs and jobs, period.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Mr. Trump, yesterday, the last Republican presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, called on you to release your back tax returns, and said, and Im quoting him now, there is good reason to believe there is a bombshell in them.Romney said either youre not as wealthy as you say you are, said maybe you havent paid the kind of taxes we would expect you to pay, or you havent been giving the money to veterans or disabled people. Are any of those accusations that he has leveled true?TRUMP: All right. First of all, let me just explain. I was the first one to file a financial disclosure form  almost 100 pages. You dont learn anything about somebodys wealth with a tax return. You learn it from statements. TRUMP: I filed  which shows that Im worth over $10 billion. I built a great company with very little debt. People were shocked, the people in the back, the reporters, they were shocked when they went down. And I filed it on time. I didnt ask for five 45-day extensions, which I would have been entitled to.So as far as thats concerned, I filed it. And thats where you find out what kind of a company. You dont learn anything from a tax return.I will say this. Mitt Romney looked like a fool when he delayed and delayed and delayed. And Harry Reid baited him so beautifully. And Mitt Romney didnt file his return until a September 21st of 2012, about a month-and-a-half before the election. And it cost him big league.As far as my return, I want to file it, except for many years, Ive been audited every year. Twelve years, or something like that. Every year they audit me, audit me, audit me.Nobody gets audited  I have friends that are very wealthy people. They never get audited. I get audited every year. I will absolutely give my return, but Im being audited now for two or three years, so I cant do it until the audit is finished, obviously. And I think people would understand that.BLITZER: Hugh, go ahead.HEWITT: Mr. Trump. You told me...TRUMP: Are you going to ask anybody else that question?CARSON: Yes, amen, amen.(LAUGHTER)TRUMP: Every single question comes to me?HEWITT: Mr. Trump...(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: I know Im here for the ratings, but its a little bit ridiculous.(LAUGHTER) HEWITT: Mr. Trump, a year ago you told me on my radio show, the audio and the transcript are out there on YouTube, that you would release your tax returns.TRUMP: True.HEWITT: Are you going back on your commitment?TRUMP: No, Im not. First of all, very few people listen to your radio show. Thats the good news.(LAUGHTER)TRUMP: Let me just tell you, let me just  which happens to be true. Check out the ratings.Look, let me just tell you something. Let me just tell you something. I want to release my tax returns but I cant release it while Im under an audit. Were under a routine audit. Ive had it for years, I get audited.And obviously if Im being audited, Im not going to release a return. As soon as the audit is done, I love it.HEWITT: So, Senator Rubio, Mitt Romney also called upon to you release your tax returns. Your campaign said last spring that you would release your returns that you had not previously released. And you said, coming out any day momentarily. When are we going to see your returns?RUBIO: Yes, tomorrow or Saturday, in fact, is our plan to release them. And theres nothing really that interesting in them. So I have no problem releasing them. And luckily Im not being audited this year, or last year, for that matter.(CROSSTALK)RUBIO: But this is my time. I want to go back to this question you asked about the debt. This is an important issue. Its a huge issue, OK? In less than five years, 83 percent of our entire budget will be made up of Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and the interest on the debt.That means only 17 percent of our budget will be for things like the military or the Department of Education or environmental protection issues.You cannot balance our budget unless you deal with that 83 percent, which is why Ive been repeatedly talking about since my time running for the Senate in Florida, where there are a lot of people like my mother that depend on Social Security and Medicare, on the need to save those programs, by reforming the way they work for future generations.And I think if we  the longer we take to do this, the closer we are going to get to a debt crisis. And, Wolf, you did not get an answer to your question. This debt issue is  the next president of the United States will not be able to serve four to eight years without dealing with the national debt.It is not a question of if, it is a question of when we have a debt crisis. And we should not leave the stage here tonight without hearing a serious answer from every single one of us about how we are going to deal bring the national debt under control once and for all.HEWITT: Thank you, Senator Rubio. But I am...(APPLAUSE)HEWITT: Im being fair to all of the candidates.Senator Cruz, Tuesday is five days away. Why havent voters seen your 2012,2013, and 2014 returns?CRUZ: So, Ive released five years of tax returns already. We will have two more years available tomorrow. And I would note that this question really goes  you know, Donald says hes being audited.Well, I would think that would underscore the need to release those returns. If he has said something that was false and that an audit is going to find was fraudulent, the voters need to know.And listen, people across this country, we recognize our country is in crisis. The most important question is how do we win the general election in November, 2016. And roughly 65 percent of Republicans think Donald is not the right candidate to go against Hillary Clinton.Now, part of the reason in the last 10 polls...TRUMP: Eighty-five percent say you, big difference.CRUZ: ... RealClearPolitics he has lost to Hillary on eight of them. In the last 10 polls on RealClearPolitics, I either tied or beat Hillary. And this is an example.You know, the mainstream media is laying off Donald now. Theyre going to pick apart his taxes. Theyre going to pick apart his business deals.And lets take, for example, one of Hillarys great vulnerabilities, the corruption at the Clinton Foundation, the fact that she had CEOs and foreign companies giving her money while she was secretary of state.CRUZ: The next Republican nominee needs to be able to make that case against Hillary. And if Donald tried to did it, Hillary would turn to Donald and say, but gosh, Donald, you gave $100,000 to the Clinton foundation. I even went to your wedding.He cant prosecute the case against Hillary, and we cant risk another four years of these failed Obama policies by nominating someone who loses to Hillary Clinton in November.(APPLAUSE)(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: So at the beginning, I said openly to everybody that I contribute to many, many politicians, both Republican and Democrat. And I have, over the years. Im a businessman. I have, over the years.And I sort of have to laugh when Ted makes a big deal out of the fact that hes doing well in the polls. Well, Im beating him in virtually every poll. Im tied in Texas, by the way, which I shouldnt be. But I think Ill do very well.(APPLAUSE)But a poll just came out  a Bloomberg poll  where I am beating him so badly that its, like, embarrassing even for me to say Im beating him that badly.(APPLAUSE)And  and heres the thing  it was sort of funny  65 percent of the people dont like you  I just got 36 percent of the vote, right? I just got 46 percent on another one. I got 38 percent...(BELL RINGS)... on another one. That means  and he got 20 and 22, and he lost in South Carolina so badly  that was going to be his stronghold. He said a year ago, I cant lose South Carolina. I beat him in a landslide.Last week in Nevada, I beat him in a landslide, and he sang (ph) about the polls. One other thing  Hillary Clinton  take a look at USA Today, take a look at the Q poll. I beat her, and I beat her badly. And I  and I havent even started at her. I only had one little interchange...(APPLAUSE)... I only had one little interchange, and that was...(BELL RINGS)... four weeks ago, when she said I was sexist. And believe me, they had a rough weekend that weekend, between Bill and Hillary. They had a rough weekend.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Gentlemen. Gentlemen. Gentlemen.CRUZ: Hold on. He  he attacked me, Wolf. I get a response.BLITZER: I was about to say  Senator Cruz, respond.CRUZ: Thank you. Thank  thank  thank you very much.You know, its interesting  Donald went  went on  on an extended tirade about the polls, but he didnt respond to any of the substance. He has yet to say  he can release past years tax returns. He can do it tomorrow.He doesnt want to do it, because presumably theres something in there...TRUMP: Nothing.CRUZ: ... that is bad. If theres nothing, release them tomorrow.(CROSSTALK)CRUZ: Theyre already prepared. The only reason hes not releasing them...TRUMP: You  you dont...CRUZ: ... is because hes afraid that he will get hit.TRUMP: Im not afraid (inaudible).CRUZ: You know, Marco made reference earlier to the litigation against Trump University. Its a fraud case. His lawyers have scheduled the trial for July.I want you to think about, if this man is the nominee, having the Republican nominee...(BELL RINGS)... on the stand in court, being cross-examined about whether he committed fraud. You dont think the mainstream media will go crazy on that?And on substance, how do we nominate a candidate who has said Hillary Clinton was the best secretary of state of modern times, who agreed with her on foreign policy, who agrees with Bernie Sanders on health care, who agreed with Barack Obama on the Wall Street bailout?BLITZER: All right (ph)...CRUZ: If  weve got to win this election, and we cant do it with a candidate who agrees with Hillary Clinton and cant take it to her and beat her on the debate stage and at the polls.BLITZER: Mr. Trump. Mr,  hold on. Mr. Trump  Mr. Trump...TRUMP: ... first of all, hes talking about the polls. Im beating him awfully badly in the polls.(CROSSTALK)CRUZ: But youre not beating Hillary. Youre not beating Hillary.TRUMP: Well, then, if I cant  if  hey, if I cant beat her, youre really going to get killed, arent you?(APPLAUSE)CRUZ: So  so let me ask you this, because youre really getting beaten badly. I know youre embarrassed  I know youre embarrassed, but keep fighting  keep swinging, man (ph). Swing for the fences.Let me just tell you  let me just tell you, the Trump University case is a civil case. Not a  its a civil case. Its a case where people want to try and get  its a case that is nonsense.Its something I could have settled many times. I could settle it right now for very little money, but I dont want to do it out of principle. The people that took the course all signed  most  many  many signed report cards saying it was fantastic, it was wonderful, it was beautiful.As  and believe me, Ill win that case. Thats an easy case. Civil case. Number two, as far as the taxes are concerned, Im being audited. Its a very routine audit, and its very unfair, because Ive been audited for, I think, over 12 years.Every year, because of the size of my company, which is very, very large, Im being audited  which is a very large company.(BELL RINGS)BLITZER: Thank you.TRUMP: Im being audited 12 years in a row, at least.Now, until that audits done, and I dont think anybody would blame me, Im not giving it...(CROSSTALK)CRUZ: ... the years youre not being audited? Will you release those years?BLITZER: Gentlemen, gentlemen, thank you.TRUMP: (inaudible) audited for those years.CRUZ: Which years? Which years are you being audited?BLITZER: Gentlemen...(CROSSTALK)BLITZER: ... we actually have rules  were trying to obey these rules that all of you agreed. Were going to take a quick break. We have a lot more  many more critically important issues to discuss.Our coverage of this tenth Republican presidential debate from the University of Houston continues in a moment.(APPLAUSE)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BLITZER: Welcome back to the Republican presidential debate here at the University of Houston.Gentlemen, I want to turn our attention right now to key issues involving foreign policy and national security. And Mr. Trump, Ill begin with you.TRUMP: Shocking.(LAUGHTER)BLITZER: You said this about the ongoing conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians  Im quoting you now: Let me be sort of a neutral guy. I dont want to say whose fault it is, I dont think it helps.TRUMP: Right.BLITZER: Heres the question. How do you remain neutral when the U.S. considers Israel to be Americas closest ally in the Middle East?TRUMP: Well, first of all, I dont think they do under President Obama because I think hes treated Israel horribly, all right? I think hes treated Israel horribly. (APPLAUSE)TRUMP: I was the grand marshall down 5th Avenue a number of years ago for the Israeli Day Parade, I have very close ties to Israel. Ive received the Tree of Life Award and many of the greatest awards given by Israel.As president, however, theres nothing that I would rather do to bring peace to Israel and its neighbors generally. And I think it serves no purpose to say that you have a good guy and a bad guy.Now, I may not be successful in doing it. Its probably the toughest negotiation anywhere in the world of any kind. OK? But it doesnt help if I start saying, I am very pro-Israel, very pro, more than anybody on this stage. But it doesnt do any good to start demeaning the neighbors, because I would love to do something with regard to negotiating peace, finally, for Israel and for their neighbors.And I cant do that as well  as a negotiator, I cannot do that as well if Im taking big, big sides. With that being said, I am totally pro-Israel.BLITZER: Senator Cruz?(APPLAUSE)CRUZ: Well, this is another area on which Donald agrees with Hillary Clinton and on which I disagree with them both strongly. Both Donald and Hillary Clinton want to be neutral, to use Donalds word, between Israel and the Palestinians.Let me be clear. If Im president, America will stand unapologetically with the nation of Israel.(APPLAUSE)And the notion of neutrality is based upon the left buying into this moral relativism that is often pitched in the media. Listen, it is not equivalent. When you have terrorist strapping dynamite around their chest, exploding and murdering innocent women and children, they are not equivalent to the IDF officers protecting Israel. And I will not pretend that they are.Just today, Iran announced theyre going to pay $7,000 to each suicide bomber. And I would note, missing from Donalds answer was anything he has done in his nearly 70 years of living defending Israel. I have over and over again led the fight to defend Israel, to fight for Israel. And this  if you want to know who will stand with Israel, we ought to start with who has stood with Israel when the heat was on.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Mr. Trump?TRUMP: Well, I can only say  look, I can only say Ive been a big contributor to Israel over the years. Ive received many, many awards from Israel, as Ive said before. I have a great relationship with Israel. And Im going to keep it that way. And if I could bring peace, that would be a fantastic thing. It would be one of my greatest achievements as president.BLITZER: Governor Kasich, I want you to weigh in.KASICH: Well, I mean, well, I was in Congress for 18 years on the Defense Committee. And then, you know, after 9/11, the secretary of defense called me in to help out with some things. And Ive been a supporter of Israel  a strong supporter of Israel longer than anybody on this stage. I didnt give as much money as Donald gave, but Ive been standing with the Israelis for a very long time.And frankly, I think the problem we have in foreign policy right now, Wolf, is that we are not certain with who we stand with. Our allies are not sure what to make of us, and our enemies are moving. And one  are moving because theyre not sure what we will do.Its a very interesting development here within the 24 hours. We said to the South Koreans that we would give them the high altitude defense system. It really rattled the Chinese, and for the first time since we took positive action, the Chinese are beginning to take action against North Korea.When we stand firm and we let the world know who were with, who we stand for, and we bring our allies together, that is the road forward.(CROSSTALK)(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Were going to get to North Korea in a moment. But Senator Rubio, whats wrong with the U.S. being an honest broker in a negotiation, as Mr. Trump is proposing?RUBIO: Because  and I dont know if Donald realizes this. Im sure its not his intent perhaps. But the position youve taken is an anti-Israel position. And heres why. Because you cannot be an honest broker in a dispute between two sides in which one of the sides is constantly acting in bad faith. The Palestinian Authority has walked away from multiple efforts to make peace, very generous offers from the Israels. Instead, heres what the Palestinians do. They teach their four- year-old children that killing Jews is a glorious thing. Heres what Hamas does. They launch rockets and terrorist attacks again Israel on an ongoing basis. The bottom line is, a deal between Israel and the Palestinians, given the current makeup of the Palestinians, is not possible.And so the next president of the United States needs to be someone like me who will stand firmly on the side of Israel. Im not  Im not going to sit here and say, Oh, Im not on either side. I will be on a side. I will be on Israels side every single day because they are the only pro-American, free enterprise democracy in the entire Middle East.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Mr. Trump?TRUMP: Im a negotiator. Ive done very well over the years through negotiation. Its very important that we do that. In all fairness, Marco is not a negotiator. I watched him melt down and Ill tell you, it was one of the saddest things Ive ever seen. Hes not going down  excuse me...RUBIO: He thinks a Palestinian is a real estate deal.TRUMP: ... wait a minute, and these people may even be tougher than Chris Christie. OK?RUBIO: The Palestinians are not a real estate deal, Donald.TRUMP: OK, no, no, no  a deal is a deal. Let me tell you that. I learned a long time ago.RUBIO: A deal is not a deal when youre dealing with terrorists. Have you ever negotiated with terrorists?TRUMP: You are not a negotiator. You are not a negotiator. (APPLAUSE)TRUMP: And, with your thinking, you will never bring peace. You will never bring peace...RUBIO: ... Donald, might be able to (inaudible) Palestinians and Arabs, but its not a real estate deal...TRUMP: ... Excuse me, I want to be able to bring peace...BLITZER: ... Senator.TRUMP: He will never be able to do it. I think I may be able to do it, although I will say this. Probably the toughest deal of any kind is that particular deal.BLITZER: Lets move on to talk about North Korea. You raised it, Governor Kasich. The threat posed by North Korea to the United States and its sallies, the commander of American forces in South Korea said that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un would use a weapon of mass destruction if he thought his regime was being threatened. You have said the United States should start examining a strategy of regime change in North Korea.Lets be clear. Are you talking about getting rid of Kim Jong Un?KASICH: When you talk about regime change, Wolf, it means regime change. Thats what it means. Even though theres so much chaos in North Korea right now, theres a lot of reports of uncertainty, and instability in that government.But, look, heres what I think we ought to do  like, immediately. And, weve been kicking the can down the road on this for, I dont know, 15 years. We should be intercepting the ships that are leaving North Korea so theyre not selling this material, or this technology, or giving it to someone else.Secondly, the same goes with the aircraft.Thirdly, we need to slap even tougher sanctions on North Korea because we really dont have the toughest sanctions on North Korea. We ought to talk about arming South Korea with ballistic missile technology. And, of course, also Japan with ballistic missile technology. Because were now starting to take a firm position. We have the attention of the Chinese. The Chinese are the best way to calm that regime down and get them in a position of where they back off.But, when I say regime change, I dont have to talk exactly what that means. Look, Ive been involved in national security for a long time. You dont have to spell everything out, but what Im telling you is you look for any means you can to be able to solve that problem in North Korea, and in the meantime put the pressure on the Chinese. And, what were doing is beginning to work against them.They are the key to being able to settle this situation.BLITZER: I just want to be precise, Governor Kasich, this is critically important. There are a million North Korean troops North of the DMZ...KASICH: ... Im very well aware of that.BLITZER: A million South Korean troops,28,000 U.S. troops along the DMZ, right in between. Would you risk war for a regime change?KASICH: Wolf, again, it would depend exactly what, you know, what was happening. What the situation was. But, if there was an opportunity to remove the leader of North Korea and create stability? Because, Ill tell you, you keep kicking the can down the road were going to face this sooner or later.But, in the meantime, Im also aware of the fact that theres 10 million people living in Seoul. So, you dont just run around making charges. I have put it on the table that I would leave to see regime change in North Korea.Now, perhaps the Chinese can actually accomplish that with this man who is now currently the leader, but the fact is we have to bring everything to bear. We have to be firm, and weve got to unite those people in that part of the world to stand firmly against North Korea, and make sure we have the ballistic...(BELL RINGING)KASICH: ... ballistic missile technology to defend ourselves.BLITZER: Mr. Trump.TRUMP: One thing Id like to add to what the Governors saying, I think that we are now in a position  are $19 trillion dollars because of the horrible omnibus budget that was approved six weeks ago, its going to be $21 trillion dollars. We can no longer defend all of these countries, Japan, Germany, South Korea.You order televisions, you order almost anything, youre getting it from these countries. Whether its a Mercedes-Benz, or whether its an air conditioning unit. Theyre coming out of these countries. They are making a fortune. Saudi Arabia, we are defending Saudi Arabia. Before the oil went down, now theyre making less, but theyre making plenty. They were making $1 billion dollars a day.(BELL RINGING)We defend all of these countries for peanuts. You talk about budgets. We have to start getting reimbursed for taking care of the military services for all of these countries.(APPLAUSE)KASICH: Hey, Wolf, Wolf...BLITZER: Dr. Carson.KASICH: Hey, Wolf, let me just say this because he mentioned this. Look, were all in agreement that the Japanese need to do more. Were all in agreement that the Europeans need to do more, but I hate to just tell everybody we are the leader of the world and we should put the pressure on them to do their job. There is no question about it.But, at the same time, we also have to rebuild the military. Look, I have a balanced budget plan that cuts taxes, reforms regulations, but also builds the military, puts a $100 billion dollars more in defense. We need to rebuild our defenses,But, I must also tell you, a long time reformer of the Pentagon, we must reform that building.(BELL RINGING)We cant have a weapon system take 22 and a half years. We have 800,000 bureaucrats working for DOD, performing bureaucratic functions when we ought to be putting...BLITZER: ... Thank you...KASICH: ... these resources into strengthening the military. So, we can do it all...BLITZER: Dr. Carson, how would you deal with North Korea?CARSON: OK. Well first of all, people say that I whine a lot because I dont get time. Im going to whine because I didnt get asked about taxes, I didnt get asked about Israel. Hugh, you said youre going to be fair to everybody, you didnt ask me about taxes. I had something to say about that.Now...BLITZER: Go ahead. This is your moment.(APPLAUSE)CARSON: OK. We have a system of taxation in this country that is horribly wrong. You know, I never had an audit until I spoke at the National Prayer Breakfast, and then all of a sudden, they came in, they said we just want to look at your real estate dealings. And then they didnt find anything, so they said lets look at the whole year. And they didnt find anything, so they said lets look at the next year and the next year. They didnt find anything and they wont find anything because Im a very honest person.But he fact of the matter is the IRS is not honest and we need to get rid of them.(APPLAUSE)And as far as Israel is concerned, you know, when I was there several months ago, I talked to a lot of people. I couldnt find a single one who didnt think that we had turned our backs on Israel. You know, they are a strategic partner for us but also recognize that we have a Judeo Christian foundation, and the last thing we need to do is to reject Israel. It doesnt mean that we cant be fair to other people. We can always be fair to other people, but, you know, its like when you have a child, you know, you want to be fair to all the children around but you have a special attention for your own child.And now, as far as North Korea is concerned, you know, Kim Jung Un is an unstable person, but he does understand strength. And I think we have to present strength to him. We should be encouraging the alliance with Japan and South Korea. We should be encouraging the placement of the THAAD, the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense, that seems to disturb not only the North Koreans but the Chinese as well.And we also need to have a much more robust naval presence in that area, and I think we need to be developing strategic defense initiative because this man is going to have long-range missiles, he is going to have nuclear capabilities. We need to be able to defend ourselves. And lastly, we should make sure that he knows that if he ever shoots a missile at us, it will be the last thing he ever does.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Thank you. Thank you. Were going to continue with national security. Go ahead, Hugh.HEWITT: Thank you, Wolf. Mr. Trump, we are less than 24 hours away from a ceasefire in Syria that has been brokered between the U.S. and Russia. Do you support this ceasefire?TRUMP: I really dont because it not working and the countries arent agreeing to it and the rebels arent agreeing and Syria is not agreeing. So Its a meaningless ceasefire.I love the idea of a ceasefire. I love the idea of  with a total cessation. But its not working, as you know very well. Its not working. If  we can do what we want with Russia but nobody else is adhering to it.So I certainly support it, I would certainly love it, but all parties have to be part of it.HEWITT: Senator Cruz, your opinion on the ceasefire.CRUZ: Well look. Were certainly hopeful that the violence will cease, but theres reason to be highly skeptical. Russia has enhanced its position because of Obamas weakness in the Middle East, weakness in Syria. And you know, as were headed to November, we need no nominate a Republican candidate that can lay out a clear difference with both Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton on foreign policy.One of the real challenges with both Donald and Senator Rubio is that they have agreed over and over again with both Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. So for example, in Libya, both of them agreed with the Obama/Clinton policy of toppling the government in Libya. That was a disaster. It gave the country over to radical Islamic terrorism and it endangered America.Another example is John Kerry. John Kerry  Senator Rubio voted to confirm John Kerry as secretary of State. I voted against him. And Donald Trump supported John Kerry against George W. Bush in 2004, gave him a check. And John Kerry has been the most anti-Israel secretary of State this country has ever seen. His diplomacy has been a disaster. And if we nominate someone who agreed with John Kerry, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton on foreign policy, were not in a strong position to win the general election.(APPLAUSE)HEWITT: A response, Mr. Trump, then Mr. Rubio.TRUMP: Again, I think I gave them both checks to be exactly honest. I think they both liked me very much. But the fact is that ...CRUZ: But you called for Bush to be impeached.TRUMP: Well, I think Bush did a hell of a bad as far as thats concerned. You know it and so do I.CRUZ: But you gave him a check and called for him to be impeached.TRUMP: Be honest. Be honest. No, this was before. The check came early. TRUMP: But let me just tell you, Syria, hes saying that I was in favor of Syria. He said I was in favor of Libya? I never discussed that subject. I was in favor of Libya? We would be so much better off if Gadhafi were in charge right now.If these politicians went to the beach and didnt do a thing, and we had Saddam Hussein and if we had Gadhafi in charge, instead of having terrorism all over the place, wed be  at least they killed terrorists, all right?And Im not saying they were good because they were bad, they were really bad, but we dont know what were getting. You look at Libya right now, ISIS, as we speak, is taking over their oil. As we speak, its a total mess.We would have been better off if the politicians took a day off instead of going into war.(APPLAUSE)HEWITT: Senator Rubio.RUBIO: Yes, a couple of points. Number one, on the Libya situation, we didnt topple Gadhafi, the Libyan people toppled Gadhafi. The only choice before America that this president had to make is, does it happen quickly or does it take a long time?And I argued if it takes a long time, youre going to have rebel forces emerge like these radical Islamists to take advantage of the vacuum. And thats what happened. Thats where the term lead from behind came. And thats the foreign policy that apparently Senator Cruz appears to agree with.On John Kerry, yes, you know why, because every day John Kerry wasnt appointed was another day Hillary Clinton was still in charge of the State Department. And she was absolutely horrible.I couldnt imagine that they were going to find somebody even worse than her, but this president never ceases to amaze.(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: And the last point I would make on South Korea, now this is important, because were asking to be commander-in-chief. Donald is asking to be commander-in-chief. And hes saying these guys need to do more.South Korea contributes $800 million a year to that effort. And Japan contributes as well. And heres why our commitment to that regional security is so critical, Donald, because if we walk away from them, both Japan and South Korea will become nuclear weapons powers.They can do that very quickly. And thats what they will do if the American defense agreements wither away, which is why we have to rebuild the military, but why we cant walk away from our Asia-Pacific defense status.HEWITT: Mr. Trump.TRUMP: I never said walk away. I wouldnt want to walk away. I want them to pay us much more money. We cannot afford to subsidize...RUBIO: How much?TRUMP: A lot. Ill negotiate a lot more money than youll ever get.As far as John Kerry is concerned, there has been no tougher critic of this man, I think he negotiated one of the worst deals in the history of our country, the Iran deal, where they get their $150 billion and all of the other things that take place.It is a disaster for this country, and speaking of Israel, its a disaster for Israel. Im no fan of John Kerry.(CROSSTALK)BLITZER: Hold on, hold on, Governor.Senator Cruz.CRUZ: You know, its interesting, Donald just said that he never came out in favor of toppling Gadhafi in Libya. Well, he stated that in an interview that will be on our Web site, tedcruz.org.You can see and hear the exact words from Donalds mouth. And I assume when he sees that interview, maybe he forgot about it, but I assume Donald will apologize where he sees that he said exactly that.With regard to John Kerry, I will say John Kerrys foreign policy has been a disaster for decades. Thats why I voted against him when he came up. And the fact that Donald Trump would write him a check and support him against George W. Bush shows exceptionally poor foreign policy judgment.And Ill give one more example on Israel. When the Obama administration canceled civilian air flights into the national of Israel, when Hamas was raining rockets down on them, I publicly asked, is this an economic boycott against Israel?The next day Michael Bloomberg, another New York billionaire, got on a plane, a commercial flight, and flew to Israel from London. Together the heat and light that was put on the State Department was so great that within 36 hours they lifted the ban on air flights into Israel.During that entire battle, and indeed during every battle on Israel the natural question is, where was Donald? If this is something he cares about, why has he supported anti-Israel politicians from Jimmy Carter to Hillary Clinton to John Kerry for four decades?If you care about Israel, you dont write checks to politicians who are undermining Israel. Instead you stand and support the national security of America and the alliance with Israel.(CROSSTALK)KASICH: Theres a critical point that needs to be made here.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Governor, Governor, Governor, he attacked Mr. Trump.Mr. Trump has a right to respond.TRUMP: Well, look, my response is very simple. There is nobody on this stage that has done more for Israel than I have. Nobody. You might say, you might talk, youre politicians, all talk, no action.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: Ive been watching it all my life. You are all talk and no action.CRUZ: Then name one specific thing youve done.TRUMP: What Ive seen up here  I mean, first of all, this guy is a choke artist, and this guy is a liar. You have a combination...RUBIO: This guy always goes for...TRUMP: You have a combination of factors. He cant do it...RUBIO: This is so typical.TRUMP: ... for the obvious reason, and he cant do it because he doesnt know how to tell the truth. Other than that, I rest my case.(CROSSTALK)BLITZER: One at a time, gentlemen.Governor Kasich, you have the floor. Governor...(CROSSTALK)BLITZER: You will have a response. But I promised Governor Kasich he could respond.CARSON: Can somebody attack me, please? (LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)KASICH: Theres something  I want to  I want to point out something here today that is  its so critically important  about how the Obama administration has really done such a ridiculous, feckless job here in foreign policy.First of all, we should have been supporting the rebels long ago. They could have taken Assad out, and because we did nothing, the Russians are in, and theyre sitting in the catbird seat.We should have been helping them. Im thankful that the aid trucks are finally getting into Syria. But the fact is, had we had acted, we would have solved that problem.Now, lets talk about Libya. Libya didnt go down because there was some people revolution. Hillary Clinton, Samantha Power and all these other people convinced the president to undermine Gadhafi. They undermined him, and now they have created a cesspool in Libya.And let me just say to you  we have ISIS beginning get  get a foothold in Libya. Were gonna have to deal with it. There are not many major cities in Libya. Theyre on the coast, which  mostly, its desert, but its a problem.Then we have ISIS in  in Syria, and we have ISIS in Iraq. Because this administration has not had a strong and firm foreign policy, we are going to inherit  one of us here is going to inherit a total mess...BLITZER: All right...KASICH: ... and were going to have to work our way out of it, including...BLITZER: Lets continue.KASICH: ... the need to arm the Ukrainians. They have been ignored, and we need to help them as well...BLITZER: Let us continue.KASICH: ... and assert ourselves as America.BLITZER: Lets continue the questioning on ISIS. Maria.CRUZ: Hold on, Wolf. You said I got a response.BLITZER: Youll have a chance. Maria will pick up...(CROSSTALK)CRUZ: Hold on. He called me a liar. Youre saying I cant respond to being called a liar?(CROSSTALK)BLITZER: Go ahead and respond.CRUZ: You know, what were seeing with Donald is actually the pattern of Washington  the pattern of Washington deal makers, which is they make promises, they break their words, and then when anyone calls them on it, they call you a liar.And so thats Donalds pattern over and over again. He said, for example, seven months ago  this is Donald speaking, quote  I, Donald Trump, was a member of the establishment.Theres a reason Harry Reid thinks hes the best Republican up here. Theres a reason Jimmy Carter said he would support Donald Trump over me, because he said Donald Trump is malleable, he has no fixed set of beliefs...(BELL RINGS)... whereas Ted Cruz is not malleable. And every time anyone points at Donalds actual record...BLITZER: Thank you.CRUZ: ... what he said on national television, Donald yells liar. Let me tell you something  falsely accusing someone of lying is itself a lie...BLITZER: Go ahead, Mr. Trump.CRUZ: ... and its something Donald does daily.BLITZER: Go ahead, Mr. Trump.TRUMP: I watched  I watched...(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: ... the lobbyists. I watched what this man did to Dr. Ben Carson, who I respect, in Iowa, where he said that Ben Carson is out of the race  he has left Iowa and hes out of the race. And I thought it was disgraceful.And got a lot of votes because of that  a lot of votes. Took them away from Ben Carson. I watched that. Probably took them away from me, too. But I watched it.I also watched where he did a forum that looked like it came right out of a government agency, and it said on top, Voter Violation, and then it graded you...(BELL RINGS)... and it scared the hell out of people, and it said the only way you clear up the violation, essentially, is to go and vote for Ted Cruz. I watched that fraudulent document, and I said its the worst thing Ive ever seen in politics.(BELL RINGS)To me, that was even worse than what he did to Ben.BLITZER: Senator Cruz...(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: I know politicians  I know politicians, believe it or not, better than you do. And its not good.CRUZ: I believe it. No, no. I believe you know politicians much better than I do, because for 40 years, youve been funding liberal Democratic politicians. And by the way...TRUMP: I funded you. I funded him. Can you believe it?(APPLAUSE)CRUZ: ... the reason is  youre welcome to have the check back.TRUMP: I funded this guy. I gave him a check.CRUZ: Yeah, you gave me $5,000.TRUMP: I gave him a check. He never funded me.CRUZ: And  and by the way, lets be clear.(APPLAUSE)Donald claims  Donald claims to care about...TRUMP: You know why? I didnt want to, but he sent me his book with his autograph...(CROSSTALK)CRUZ: Donald. Donald. Donald. I understand rules are very hard for you. Theyre very confusing.TRUMP: Mr. Trump, youre doing a great job. I have his book.(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: Thank you  thank you for the book. Go ahead.CRUZ: Donald, you can get back on your meds now.TRUMP: This is a lot of fun up here tonight, I have to tell you.(APPLAUSE)Thank  thank you for the book. I really appreciate (ph).CRUZ: Donald  Donald, relax.TRUMP: Go ahead. Im relaxed. Youre the basket case.(CROSSTALK)Go ahead.CRUZ: Donald...TRUMP: Go ahead. Dont get nervous.CRUZ: (inaudible)...TRUMP: Go ahead.(CROSSTALK)CRUZ: I promise you, Donald, theres nothing about you...TRUMP: Ive seen you.CRUZ: ... that makes anyone nervous.TRUMP: Youre losing so badly you  I want to...CRUZ: You know, people are actually watching this at home.TRUMP: ... I  you dont know whats happening.(CROSSTALK)BLITZER: Gentlemen, gentlemen.CRUZ: Wolf, Im going to ask my time not be deducted when hes yelling at me.BLITZER: Youve gotta stop this.(CROSSTALK)BLITZER: The latest debate  gentlemen, please.CRUZ: Hold on, Im going to get my answer. He doesnt get to yell the whole time. BLITZER: I want to move  I want to move on. These are the rules.(CROSSTALK)CRUZ: Excuse me, he called me a liar, then interrupted the whole time. Am I allowed to...(CROSSTALK)(APPLAUSE)CRUZ: Wolf, do I not get a response? Do I not get a response without being interrupted?BLITZER: Youll get  youll get plenty of response, so stand by.CARSON: My name was mentioned.BLITZER: I want to talk  I want to talk about ISIS right now, and the federal government  how much best to keep Americans safe from ISIS.BLITZER: Theres a huge battle underway right now between the tech giant Apple and the federal government. The federal government wants Apple to unlock the phone used by that San Bernardino terrorist to prevent future attacks. Apple has refused, saying it would compromise the security of all of its customers. And just this afternoon, they went to court to block the judges order.Dana Bash, pick up the questioning.BASH: Senator Rubio, you say its complicated, and that, quote, Apple isnt necessarily wrong to refuse the court order. Why shouldnt investigators have everything at their disposal?RUBIO: No, in fact what I have said is the only thing  the FBI made this very clear 48 hours ago  the only thing they are asking of Apple is that Apple allow them to use their own systems in the FBI to try to guess the password of the San Bernardino killer. Apple initially came out saying, Were being ordered to create a back door to an encryption device. That is not accurate.The only thing theyre being asked to do, and the FBI made this very clear about 48 hours ago, is allow us to disable the self- destruct mode thats in the Apple phone so that we can try to guess using our own systems what the password of this killer was.And I think they should comply with that. If thats all theyre asking for, they are not asking for Apple to create a back door to encryption.BASH: So just to be clear, you did say on CNN a couple of weeks ago this is a complicated issue; Apple is not necessarily wrong here.RUBIO: Because at the time, Apple was portraying that the court order was to create a back door to an encryption device.BASH: But just to be clear  just to be clear, if you are president, would you instruct your Justice Department to force Apple to comply or not?RUBIO: To comply with an order that says that they have to allow the FBI the opportunity to try to guess the password?BASH: Correct.RUBIO: Absolutely. That Apple phone didnt even belong to the killer. It belonged to the killers employee (sic) who have agreed to allow him to try to do this. That is all theyre asking them to do is to disable the self-destruct mode or the auto-erase mode on one phone in the entire world. But Apple doesnt want to do it because they think it hurts their brand.Well, let me tell you, their brand is not superior to the national security of the United States of America.(APPLAUSE)BASH: Senator Cruz, Apple CEO Tim Cook says this would be bad for America. Where do you stand: national security or personal privacy?CRUZ: Well, as you know, at that same CNN forum, both Marco and I were asked this question. His answer, he was on both sides of the fence. Hes now agreeing with me. And so Im glad.What I said is yes, Apple should be forced to comply with this court order. Why? Because under the Fourth Amendment, a search and seizure is reasonable if it has judicial authorization and probable cause. In this instance, the order is not put a back door in everyones cell phone. If that was the order, that order would be problematic because it would compromise security and safety for everyone.I would agree with Apple on that broad policy question. But on the question of unlocking this cell phone of a terrorist, we should enforce the court order and find out everyone that terrorist at San Bernardino talked to on the phone, texted with, e-mailed. And absolutely, Apple doesnt have a right to defy a valid court order in a terrorism investigation.(APPLAUSE)BASH: Dr. Carson, Tim Cook, again, the CEO of Apple, says that this would be bad for America. What do you think?CARSON: I think allowing terrorist to get away with things is bad for America.(APPLAUSE)You know, we have the  we have a Constitution. We have a Fourth Amendment. It guards us against illegal and unreasonable search and seizure. But we have mechanisms in place with the judicial system that will allow us to gain material that is necessary to benefit the nation as a whole or the community as a whole. And thats why we have FISA courts and things of that nature.So absolutely, I would  I would expect Apple to comply with the court order. If they dont comply with that, youre encouraging chaos in our system.BASH: Mr. Trump...(APPLAUSE) KASICH: I want to weigh in on this please. I want to just tell you that the problem is not right now between the administration and Apple. You know what the problem is? Wheres the president been? You sit down in a back room and you sit down with the parties and you get this worked out. You dont litigate this on the front page of the New York Times, where everybody in the world is reading about their dirty laundry out here.The president of the United States should be convening a meeting, should have convened a meeting with Apple and our security forces. And then you know what you do when youre the president? You lock the door and you say youre not coming out until you reach an agreement that both gives the security people what they need and protects the rights of Americans. This is a failure of his leadership to get this done as an executive should be doing it.And Ill tell you, thats why you want a governor. I do this all the time. And we reach agreements all the time. Because as an executive, youve got to solve problems instead of fighting on the front page of the newspaper.ARRASAS: Thank you, Governor.(APPLAUSE)KASICH: Thank you.ARRARAS: Mr. Trump, you have been very vocal about securing the Mexican border, but ISIS has called upon its supporters to conduct attacks on our neighbor to the North, Canada.As a matter of fact, U.S. officials have warned that it is the Canadian border which is the most significant threat. You have said that you will not build a wall in Canada. When it comes to national security, and the threat of terrorism, why does Mexico need a wall, and Canada doesnt? Isnt that, like, closing the front door, and leaving the back door open?TRUMP: First of all, youre talking about a border thats many, many times longer. Youre talking about a massive border.We have far less problem with that border than we do with our Southern border, and tremendous amounts  you know, I won, I had the privilege of winning by a landslide, by the way, New Hampshire.You go to New Hampshire, the first thing they talk about is heroin and drugs pouring in. And, you wouldnt think this beautiful place  its beautiful. With the trees and the roads, and the countryside. Their biggest problem is heroin, and its such a shame to see it.Theyre pouring in from the Southern border, so Im talking about great security. Im talking about a wall that can absolutely be built, and Ill build it on time, on budget. Itll be a very high wall, a great wall. Its going to be built, its going to be built. Its going to be paid for by Canada, by the way  maybe Ill get Canada to pay? Got to be paid for by Mexico.The problem with Canada, youre talking about a massively long piece. Youre talking about a border that would be about four times longer. It would be very, very hard to do, and we  it is not our biggest problem. I dont care what anyone says. It is not our big problem. Our big problem is not only people coming in, and in many cases the wrong people, its the tremendous amount of drugs that are coming in.(APPLAUSE)ARRARAS: I want to talk to you, Senator Rubio, about Puerto Rico. As you know, Puerto Ricos in the midst of financial collapse, unable to pay its debt of $72 billion dollars. Puerto Rico is asking for bankruptcy protection which would give Puerto Rico, and Puerto Ricans, which are U.S. citizens, you know that  the tools to restructure the debt. That is the same debt the other 50 states have.You oppose granting Puerto Rico that bankruptcy protection. You say that it is only a last resort measure, but the government of Puerto Rico has said that bankruptcy is its last resort. That thats where they are now. How do you explain this very strong stance to the hundreds of thousands of Puerto Ricans that vote across the U.S. , and particularly in your state of Florida?RUBIO: Sure, because bankruptcy doesnt work unless you change the way youre operating, or youre going to be bankrupt again. And, the problem with Puerto Rico is its economy is not growing. It has a massive exodus of professionals and others that are leaving to my home state of Florida, and all over the country.Theyre coming to the mainland from Puerto Rico because the economy there is not growing, its too expensive to do business there. The tax rate is too high. The government regulations are too extensive.This year alone, with all the problems theyre having, they barely cut their budget from one year to the next. So, I think the leadership on the island has to show their willingness to get their house in order and put in place measures allow the economy there to grow again. If the economy of Puerto Rico does not grow they will never generate the revenue to pay this debt, or the billions of dollars in unfunded liabilities that they have on their books of promises theyve made to future generations to make payments.So, yes, if they do all of those things then we can explore the use of bankruptcy protection, but not as the first resort, which is what theyre asking for, because it will not solve the problems on the island and youre going to continue to see hundreds of thousands of people leave that beautiful place, and coming to the mainland.Theyre United States citizens, theyre obviously entitled to do so, and we welcome them, but we would also prefer to see a Puerto Rico that once again is growing economically, and is robust. And, the leaders in charge there now are doing a terrible job.Their previous governor, Louis Fortuno was doing a great job until he barely lost that election to...(BELL RINGING)RUBIO: ... to someone who has taken a big government stance (ph) once again...BLITZER: ... Senator, thank you very much.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: I want our viewers to stay with us right now, including the last pitch in the final debate before Super Tuesday.(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Welcome back to the University of Houston. Its time now for closing statements. All of you will have 30 seconds. Dr. Carson, well start with you.CARSON: Well first of all, I want people to think about what kind of leader do you want and what kind of person do you want your kids to emulate. Think about that.Secondly, several years ago, a movie was made about these hands. These hands by the grace of God have saved many lives and healed many families. And Im asking you tonight, America, to join hands with me to heal, inspire and revive America. If not us, who? And if not now, when?(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Governor Kasich.KASICH: Well, the last USA Today poll had me beating Hillary Clinton by 11 points, more than anybody on this stage. Secondly, I hope you saw tonight that executive experience really matters. It matters in terms of growing our economy, balancing budgets, cutting taxes, reforming regulations. Ive done it in Washington, Ive done it in Ohio, and I can go back to Washington and do it again.But I hope you also noticed tonight that I do have the foreign policy experience, not just a few years, but a lot of years in working with some of the great, great minds in this country to develop the expertise, the confidence, the firmness, the toughness and the ability to bring people together.I hope you all think about giving me your vote. I would appreciate it very much. And I tell you, we wont have to spend time figuring what were going to do. I will hit the ground running and we will get America moving again. Thank you all very much.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Senator Rubio. RUBIO: Well, thank you for having us tonight. You know, this campaign has come a long way. It was just a few months ago there were 15 or 11 us on the stage and now its narrowed and the votes are starting to count. And we have an incredible decision to make, not just about the direction of America, but the identity of our party and of the conservative movement.RUBIO: The time for games is over.I know youve had a lot of choices to make, but now its time to narrow it down. And Im asking you to get behind me, go on our Web site and join you our effort, marcorubio.com, so we can bring an end to this silliness, this looniness, and once again re-embrace all the things that made America and the Republican Party the bearer of the conservative movement in this country.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Senator Cruz.CRUZ: Washington deals are bankrupting this country. There are several deal-makers on this stage but there is only one person who has consistently stood up to both parties, fighting for the American people against the Washington deals.If Im elected president, on the first day in office I will rescind every single illegal and unconstitutional executive action. I will instruct the Department of Justice to open an investigation into Planned Parenthood and prosecute any criminal violations.I will instruct every federal agency that the persecution of religious liberty ends today. I will rip to shreds the Iranian  catastrophic Iranian nuclear deal. And I will begin the process of moving the American embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.We will repeal Obamacare, abolish of IRS, secure the border, and bring back jobs.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Mr. Trump.TRUMP: Thank you.Nobody knows politicians better than I do. Theyre all talk, theyre no action, nothing gets done. Ive watched it for years. Take a look at whats happening to our country.All of the things that Ive been talking about, whether its trade, whether its building up our depleted military, whether its taking care of our vets, whether its getting rid of Common Core, which is a disaster, or knocking out Obamacare and coming up with something so much better, I will get it done. Politicians will never, ever get it done. And we will make America great again. Thank you.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Mr. Trump, thank you.And thanks to each of the candidates, on behalf of everyone here at CNN and Telemundo. We also want to thank the Republican National Committee and the University of Houston. My thanks also to Hugh Hewitt, Maria Celeste, and Dana Bash.Super Tuesday is only five days away.Right now Anderson Cooper picks up our special coverage  Anderson.COOPER: Wolf," thanks very much."""
27,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/15/us/politics/transcript-democratic-presidential-debate.html,4/15/16,"Following is a transcript of the Democratic debate, as transcribed by the Federal News Service.BLITZER: Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders, you can now move to your lecterns while I explain a few ground rules. As moderator, Ill guide the discussion, asking questions and follow-ups. Youll also get questions from Dana Bash and Errol Louis. Youll each have one minute and 15 seconds to answer questions, 30 seconds for follow- ups. Timing lights will signal when your time is up. Both candidates have agreed to these rules now. Opening statements, youll each have two minutes.Lets begin with Senator Sanders.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: Wolf, thank you very much. CNN, thank you very much. Secretary Clinton, thank you very much.When we began this campaign almost a year ago, we started off at 3 percent in the polls. We were about 70 points behind Secretary Clinton. In the last couple of weeks, there were two polls out there that had us ahead.(APPLAUSE)Of the last nine caucuses and primaries, we have won eight of them, many of them by landslide victories.(APPLAUSE)Over the last year, we have received almost 7 million individual campaign contributions, averaging  guess what  $27 apiece, more individual campaign contributions than any candidate in American history at this point in a campaign.The reason that our campaign has done so well is because were doing something very radical: Were telling the American people the truth. And the truth is that this country is not going to move forward in a significant way for working people unless we overturn this disastrous Citizens United Supreme Court decision...(APPLAUSE)... and unless we have real campaign reform so that billionaires and super PACs cannot buy elections.(APPLAUSE)This campaign is also determined to end a rigged economy where the rich get richer and everybody else get poorer, and create an economy that works for all of us, not just the 1 percent.Thank you.BLITZER: Secretary Clinton? CLINTON: Well, first of all, its great to be here in New York, and I am delighted to...(APPLAUSE)... have this chance to discuss the issues that are important to our future. I was so honored to serve as a senator from New York for eight years...(APPLAUSE)... and to work to provide opportunity for all of our citizens to make it possible that we could knock down the barriers that stand in the way of people getting ahead and staying ahead.And during those eight years, we faced some difficult challenges together. We faced 9/11. We worked hard to rebuild New York. I was particularly concerned about our first responders and others whod been affected in their health by what they had experienced. We worked hard to bring jobs from Buffalo to Albany and all parts of New York to give more hard-working people a chance to really make the most out of their own talents.And we worked hard to really keep New York values at the center of who we are and what we do together.(APPLAUSE)And that is  that is exactly what I want to do as your president. We will celebrate our diversity. We will work together, bringing us back to being united, setting some big, bold, progressive goals for America. Thats what Im offering in this campaign, to build on the work, to build on the value that we share here in New York, to take those to Washington, and to knock down those barriers that in any way hold back not only individual Americans, bur our country from reaching our full potential. That is what my campaign is about.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Thank you, Secretary.We are going to deal with many of the issues both of you just raised. I want to begin with a question that goes right to the heart of which one of you should be the Democratic presidential nominee.BLITZER: Senator Sanders, in the last week, youve raised questions about Secretary Clintons qualifications to be president. You said that something is clearly lacking in terms of her judgment and you accused her of having a credibility gap.So let me ask you, do you believe that Secretary Clinton has the judgment to be president?SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (D-VT), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, Ive known Secretary Clinton, how long, 25 years?We worked together in the Senate. And I said that in response to the kind of attacks we were getting from the Clinton, uh, campaign. Washington Post headline says Clinton Campaign says Sanders is Unqualified and thats what the surrogates were saying.Does Secretary Clinton have the experience and the intelligence to be a president?Of course she does.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: But I do question...(APPLAUSE)SANDERS:  but I do question her judgment. I question a judgment which voted for the war in Iraq...(APPLAUSE)SANDERS:  the worst foreign policy blunder in the history of this country, voted for virtually every disastrous trade agreement which cost us millions of decent-paying jobs. And I question her judgment about running super PACs which are collecting tens of millions of dollars from special interests, including $15 million from Wall Street.I dont believe that that is...(APPLAUSE)SANDERS:  the kind of judgment we need to be the kind of president we need.BLITZER: Secretary Clinton?HILLARY CLINTON (D-NY), FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:Well, it is true that now that the spotlight is pretty bright here in New York, some things have been said and Senator Sanders did call me unqualified. Ive been called a lot of things in my life. That was a first.(LAUGHTER)CLINTON: And then he did say that...(APPLAUSE)CLINTON:  he had to question my judgment. Well, the people of New York voted for me twice to be their senator from New York and...(APPLAUSE)CLINTON:  and...(APPLAUSE)CLINTON:  and President Obama trusted my judgment enough to ask me to be secretary of State for the United States.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: So, look, we have disagreements on policy. Theres no doubt about it. But if you go and read, which I hope all of you will before Tuesday, Senator Sanders long interview with the New York Daily News, talk about judgment and talk about the kinds of problems he had answering questions about even his core issue, breaking up the banks.When asked, he could not explain how...(LAUGHTER)CLINTON:  that would be done and...(APPLAUSE)CLINTON:  when asked...(APPLAUSE)CLINTON:  when asked about a number of foreign policy issues, he could not answer about Afghanistan, about Israel, about counterterrorism, except to say if hed had some paper in front of him, maybe he could.I think you need to have the judgment on day one to be both president and commander-in-chief.BLITZER: Senator...(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: And lets talk about judgment.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes!(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: And let us talk about the worst foreign policy blunder in the modern history of this country...(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: I led the opposition to that war. Secretary Clinton voted for that. Well, lets talk about judgment. Lets talk about super PACs and 501(c)(4)s, money which is completely undisclosed.Where does the money come from?Do we really feel confident about a candidate saying that shes going to bring change in America when she is so dependent on big money interests?I dont think so.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: Well, let me...SANDERS: We have...CLINTON:  let me just say...SANDERS:  (INAUDIBLE)...CLINTON:  let me  let me say...BLITZER: Madam Secretary, let him finish.CLINTON: OK.SANDERS: Thirdly, we have got to understand that in America, we should be thinking big, not small.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Thank you.SANDERS: We need to join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee health care to all people. So I...(APPLAUSE)SANDERS:  my (INAUDIBLE).BLITZER: Thank you, Senator.Secretary?CLINTON: Well, make  make no mistake about it, this is not just an attack on me, its an attack on President Obama. President Obama...(BOOS)CLINTON: You know, let me tell you why. You may not like the answer, but Ill tell you why. President Obama had a super PAC when he ran. President Obama took tens of millions of dollars from contributors. And President Obama was not at all influenced when he made the decision to pass and sign Dodd-Frank, the toughest regulations...(APPLAUSE)CLINTON:  on Wall Street in many a year.CLINTON: So this is  this is a phony  this is a phony attack that is designed to raise questions when there is no evidence or support, to undergird the continuation that he is putting forward in these attacks.BLITZER: Thank, Secretary. Were going to continue on this, but I want Dana Bash to continue with the questioning.BASH: Secretary Clint, the government announced yesterday that five of the biggest banks on Wall Street have failed to develop plans to dismantle themselves in the event of another financial crisis. This is the second time in two years those banks neglected to come up with credible plans. So, as president, would you call on regulators to start the process of breaking up these banks? Something that the law not only allows, but actually explicitly encourages?CLINTON: Absolutely. You know, this is what Ive saying for the past year. No bank is too big to fail, no executive too powerful to jail.I have been talking about what we should be doing under Dodd- Frank. Im glad that Senator Sanders is now joining in talking about Dodd-Frank, because Dodd-Frank sets forth the approach that needs to be taken. I believe, and I will appoint regulators who are tough enough and ready enough to break up any bank that fails the test under Dodd-Frank.There are two sections there. If they fail either one, that theyre a systemic risk, a grave risk to our economy, or if they fail the other, that their living wills, which is what youre referring to, is inadequate.Lets look at what is at stake here. We can never let Wall Street wreck Main street again. I spoke out against Wall Street when I was a Senator from New York. I have been standing up and saying continuously we have the law. Weve got to execute under it. So, youre right. I will move immediately to break up any financial institution, but I go further because I want the law to extend to those that are part of the shadow banking industry. The big insurance companies, the hedge funds, something that I have been arguing for now a long time...BASH: ... Thank you, Secretary. Senator Sanders, you were recently asked what you would replace the big Wall Street banks with if you could break them up. You said, quote, Thats their decision.Why would you trust the banks to restructure themselves? SANDERS: First, Dana...BASH: when you said the whole business model was fraudulent?SANDERS: Thats right. So, lets start off with the basic premise. A few days ago Goldman Sachs formally reached a settlement with the United States government for $5 billion dollars. What Goldman Sachs acknowledged was, essentially, that they were selling fraudulent packages of subprime mortgage loans.Goldman Sachs was not the only bank, other banks, of course, did the same. Now, I dont need Dodd-Frank now to tell me that we have got to break up these banks, A, because theyre based on fraudulent principles, and B, because when you have six financial institutions that have assets equivalent to 58% of the GFP of this country, they are just too big, too much concentration of wealth and power.BASH: But, Senator...SANDERS: The point is we have got to break them up so that they do not pose a systemic risk and so that we have a vibrant economy with a competitive financial system.BASH: But Senator, you didnt answer the specific question which is not just about breaking up the banks, but why allow the banks to do it themselves?SANDERS: Because Im not sure that the government should say is you are too big to fail. Youve got to be a certain size. And, then the banks themselves can figure out what they want to sell off. I dont know that its appropriate that the Department of Treasury to be making those decisions. What we need is to make sure that they are safe.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: Dana, you know  I love being in Brooklyn.(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)CLINTON: Dana, let me add here that there are two ways to at this under Dodd-Frank, which is after all the law we passed under President Obama, and Im proud that Barney Frank, one of the authors, has endorsed me because what I have said continuously is, yes, sometimes the government may have to order certain actions. Sometime the government can permit the institution themselves to take those actions. That has to be the judgement of the regulators.But, theres another element to this. I believe strongly that executives of any of these organizations should be financially penalized if there is a settlement.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: They should have to pay up through compensation or bonuses because we have to go after not just the big giant institution, we have got to go after the people who are making the decisions in the institutions.BASH: Thank you, Madam Secretary.CLINTON: And hold them accountable as well.(APPLAUSE)BASH: Senator Sanders, you have consistently criticized Secretary Clinton for accepting money from Wall Street. Can you name one decision that she made as senator that shows that he favored banks because of the money she received?SANDERS: Sure. Sure. The obvious decision is when the greed and recklessness and illegal behavior of wall street brought this country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Recession  the Great Depression of the 30s, when millions of people lost their jobs, and their homes, and their life savings, the obvious response to that is that youve got a bunch of fraudulent operators and that they have got to be broken up.That was my view way back, and I introduced legislation to do that. Now, Secretary Clinton was busy giving speeches to Goldman Sachs for $225,000 a speech.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: So the problem response  the proper response in my view is we should break them up. And thats what my legislation does.CLINTON: Well, you can tell, Dana, he cannot come up with any example, because there is no example.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: It is important  its always important. It may be inconvenient, but its always important to get the facts straight. I stood up against the behaviors of the banks when I was a senator.I called them out on their mortgage behavior. I also was very willing to speak out against some of the special privileges they had under the tax code. When I went to the secretary of state office, the president  President Obama led the effort to pass the Dodd-Frank bill.That is the law. Now, this is our ninth debate. In the prior eight debates, I have said, we have a law. You dont just say, were upset about this. Im upset about it. You dont just say, go break them up. You have a law, because we are a nation of laws.BASH: Thank you, Madam Secretary.CLINTON: So I support Dodd-Frank, but I have consistently said thats not enough. Weve got to include the shadow banking sector.BASH: Thank you. Senator Sanders.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: Secretary Clinton called them out. Oh my goodness, they must have been really crushed by this. And was that before or after you received huge sums of money by giving speaking engagements? So they must have been very, very upset by what you did.Look, here is the difference and here is the clear difference. These banks, in my view, have too much power. They have shown themselves to be fraudulent organizations endangering the well-being of our economy.If elected president, I will break them up. We have got legislation to do that, end of discussion.(APPLAUSE)BASH: Secretary Clinton, if I may, Senator Sanders keeping bringing up the speeches that you gave to Goldman Sachs. So Id like to ask you, so youve said that you dont want to release the transcripts, until everybody does it, but if theres nothing in those speeches that you think would change voters minds, why not just release the transcripts and put this whole issue to bed?(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: You know, first of all  first of all, there isnt an issue. When I was in public service serving as the senator from New York, I did stand up to the banks. I did make it clear that their behavior would not be excused.Im the only one on this stage who did not vote to deregulate swaps and derivatives, as Senator Sanders did, which led to a lot of the problems that we had with Lehman Brothers.Now, if youre going to look at the problems that actually caused the Great Recession, youve got to look at the whole picture. It was a giant insurance company, AIG. It was an investment bank, Lehman Brothers. It was mortgage companies like Countrywide.Im not saying that Senator Sanders did something untoward when he voted to deregulate swaps and derivatives...BASH: Madam Secretary...CLINTON: ... but the fact is he did.CLINTON: And that contributed to the collapse of Lehman Brothers and started the cascade...(APPLAUSE)(CROSSTALK)BASH: Senator Sanders, one second, please. Secretary Clinton, the question was about the transcripts of the speeches to Goldman Sachs.(APPLAUSE)Why not release them?CLINTON: I have said, look, there are certain  there are certain expectations when you run for president. This is a new one. And Ive said, if everybody agrees to do it  because there are speeches for money on the other side. I know that.But I will tell you this, there is  there is a long-standing expectation that everybody running release their tax returns, and you can go  you can go to my website and see eight years of tax returns. And Ive released 30 years of tax returns. And I think every candidate, including Senator Sanders and Donald Trump, should do the same.(APPLAUSE)BASH: Secretary Clinton, were going to get to the tax returns later, but just to put a button on this, youre running now for the Democratic nomination.CLINTON: Right.BASH: And it is your Democratic opponent and many Democratic voters who want to see those transcripts. Its not about the Republicans...(CROSSTALK)(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: You know, lets set the same standard for everybody. When everybody does it, OK, I will do it, but lets set and expect the same standard on tax returns. Everybody does it, and then we move forward.BLITZER: Thank you.SANDERS: Well, let me respond. Secretary Clinton, you just heard her, everybody else does it, shell do it. I will do it.(APPLAUSE)I am going to release all of the transcripts of the speeches that I gave on Wall Street behind closed doors, not for $225,000, not for $2,000, not for two cents. There were no speeches.(APPLAUSE)And second of all, of course we will release our taxes. Jane does our taxes. Weve been a little bit busy lately. Youll excuse us. But we will...BLITZER: Senator...SANDERS: We will get them out.BLITZER: Senator...CLINTON: Well, you know, there are a lot of copy machines around.BLITZER: Senator, when are you  when are you  youve been asked for weeks and weeks to release your tax returns.SANDERS: Well, I think we got one thats coming out tomorrow.BLITZER: Which one?SANDERS: Last years.BLITZER: 2014?SANDERS: Yes.BLITZER: What about 2013, all the other ones?SANDERS: Youll get them, yes. Yeah, look, I dont want to get anybody very excited. They are very boring tax returns. No big money from speeches, no major investments. Unfortunately  unfortunately, I remain one of the poorer members of the United States Senate. And thats what that will show.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: So, Senator, just to be clear, tomorrow you will release the 2014 tax returns from you and your family?SANDERS: Yes.BLITZER: And what about the earlier ones? Whats the problem... SANDERS: Yes.BLITZER: Whats taking so long? Because you just have to go to the filing cabinet, make a copy, and release them.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: Wolf, the answer is, you know, what we have always done in my family is, Jane does them. And shes been out on the campaign trail. We will get them out. Well get them out very shortly. Its not a big deal.BLITZER: Thank you. Senator, Senator, youve slammed companies like General Electric and Verizon for moving jobs outside of the United States. Yesterday, the CEO of Verizon called your views contemptable and said in your home state of Vermont Verizon has invested more than $16 million and pays millions of dollars a year to local businesses. He says you are, quote, uninformed on this issue and disconnected from reality. Given your obvious contempt for large American corporations, how would you as president of the United States be able to effectively promote American businesses around the world?SANDERS: Well, for a start, I would tell the gentleman whos the CEO at Verizon to start negotiating with the Communication Workers of America.(APPLAUSE)And this is  this is a perfect example, Wolf, of the kind of corporate greed which is destroying the middle class of this country. This gentleman makes $18 million a year in salary. Thats his  thats his compensation. This gentleman is now negotiating to take away health care benefits of Verizon workers, outsource call center jobs to the Philippines, and  and trying to create a situation where workers will lose their jobs. He is not investing in the way he should in inner cities in America.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: All right. Senator, but the question was, the question was, given your contempt for large American corporations, as president, how would you be able to promote American business around the world?SANDERS: First of all, the word contempt is not right. There are some great businesses who treat their workers and the environment with respect.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: Verizon happens not to be one of them.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: And what we need to do is to tell this guy Immelt, whos the head of General Electric, he doesnt like me, well, thats fine. He has outsourced hundreds of thousands of decent-paying jobs throughout the world...(APPLAUSE)SANDERS:  cut his workforce here substantially and in a given year, by the way, it turns out that both Verizon and General Electric, in a given year, pay nothing in federal income tax despite making billions in profits.(BOOS)BLITZER: But Senator, experts say that no matter the means to bring back these jobs to the United States, prices of goods for consumers in the United States would go up, which would disproportionately impact the poor and middle class.So how do you bring back these jobs to the United States without affecting the cost of goods to Americas middle class and poor?SANDERS: Well, for a start, were going to raise the minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: And number two, while it is true we may end up paying a few cents more for a hamburger in McDonalds, at the end of the day, what this economy desperately needs is to rebuild our manufacturing sector with good-paying jobs.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: We cannot continue to sustain the loss of millions of decent-paying jobs that we have seen over the last 20, 30 years, based on trade agreements of which Secretary Clinton has voted for almost every one of those. That has got to change.BLITZER: Thank you.Secretary...(LAUGHTER)BLITZER:  Secretary Clinton?(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: Well, first of all, I do have a very comprehensive plan to create more jobs and I think that has to be at the center of our economic approach. And so I think it is important that we do more on manufacturing. I went to Syracuse and laid out a $10 billion plan that would, I believe, really jump-start advanced manufacturing.I have seen the results of what can happen when we have the government cooperating with business. And thats exactly what I will do.When I was secretary of State, I helped to lead the way to increased exports of American good around the world, which supports tens of thousands of jobs.So I think youve got to go at this with a sense of how to accomplish the goal we are setting  more good jobs with rising incomes for people everywhere from inner cities to rural areas to every distressed community in America. And thats exactly what my plan would bring about.I think we have a pretty good record if we look at what happened...BLITZER: Senator...CLINTON:  in the 1990s, we got 23 million new jobs and incomes went up for everybody.BLITZER: Thank you.CLINTON: Lets do that again in America.BLITZER: Senator, how do you...SANDERS: Im going to respond...BLITZER: Ill have you respond in a moment.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Stand by.SANDERS: Well, look...BLITZER: Secretary Clinton... (CROSSTALK)BLITZER: You will respond in a moment, but I have to follow-up with Secretary Clinton.You stood on the stage with Governor Cuomo in support of new legislation to raise New Yorks minimum wage to $15 an hour. But you do not support raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour.As president...(APPLAUSE)BLITZER:  if a Democratic Congress put a $15 minimum wage bill on your desk, would you sign it?CLINTON: Well, of course I would. And I have supported...(APPLAUSE)CLINTON:  I have supported the fight for 15. I am proud to have the endorsement of most of the unions that have led the fight for 15. I was proud to stand on the stage with Governor Cuomo, with SEIU and others who have been leading this battle and I will work as hard as I can to raise the minimum wage. I always have. I supported that when I was in the Senate.SANDERS: Well, look...CLINTON: But what I have also said is that weve got to be smart about it, just the way Governor Cuomo was here in New York. If you look at it, we moved more quickly to $15 in New York City, more deliberately toward $12, $12.50 upstate then to $15. That is exactly my position. Its a model for the nation and thats what I will do as president.BLITZER: Thank you.CLINTON: Go as quickly as...(CROSSTALK)CLINTON:  to get to $15.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: I am sure a lot of people are very surprised to learn that you supported raising the minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: You know, wait a minute...SANDERS: (INAUDIBLE).CLINTON:  wait a minute. SANDERS: (INAUDIBLE).CLINTON:  wait, wait...SANDERS: Thats just not accurate. Well...CLINTON: Come on, I have stood on the debate stage...SANDERS:  well and I...CLINTON:  with Senator Sanders eight...(CROSSTALK)CLINTON:  times.SANDERS: Excuse me.CLINTON: I have said the...SANDERS: Well...CLINTON: Exact same thing.BLITZER: Secretary, Senator, please.CLINTON: If we can...(CROSSTALK)CLINTON:  raise it to $15 in New York...(CROSSTALK)CLINTON:  or Los Angeles or Seattle...BLITZER: Secretary, the viewers...CLINTON:  lets do it.BLITZER: If youre both screaming at each other, the viewers wont be able to hear either of you.SANDERS: OK.BLITZER: So please...SANDERS: I will...BLITZER:  dont talk over each other.SANDERS: I believe I was...(CROSSTALK)BLITZER: Go ahead.SANDERS:  responding.All right? When this campaign began, I said that we got to end the starvation minimum wage of $7.25, raise it to $15. Secretary Clinton said lets raise it to $12. Theres a difference. And, by the way, what has happened is history has outpaced Secretary Clinton, because all over this country, people are standing up and theyre saying $12 is not good enough, we need $15 an hour.CLINTON: OK.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Go ahead, Secretary. Secretary?SANDERS: And suddenly...BLITZER: Secretary, go ahead.SANDERS: To suddenly...CLINTON: Thank you. Thank you very much.SANDERS: To suddenly announce now that youre for $15, I dont think is quite accurate.BLITZER: All right. Secretary?CLINTON: All right. I have said from the very beginning that I supported the fight for $15. I supported those on the front lines of the fight for  it happens to be true. I also  I supported the $15 effort in L.A. I supported in Seattle. I supported it for the fast food workers in New York.The minimum wage at the national level right now is $7.25, right? We want to raise it higher than it ever has been, but we also have to recognize some states and some cities will go higher, and I support that. I have taken my cue from the Democrats in the Senate, led by Senator Patty Murray and others, like my good friend Kirsten Gillibrand, who has said we will set a national level of $12 and then urge any place that can go above it to go above it.Going from $7.25 to $12 is a huge difference. Thirty-five million people will get a raise. One in four working mothers will get a raise. I want to get something done. And I think setting the goal to get to $12 is the way to go, encouraging others to get to $15. But, of course, if we have a Democratic Congress, we will go to $15.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Senator, go ahead.SANDERS: Well, I think the secretary has confused a lot of people. I dont know how youre there for the fight for $15 when you say you want a $12-an-hour national minimum wage.(APPLAUSE)Now, in fact  in fact, there is an effort, Patty Murray has introduced legislation for $12 minimum wage. Thats good. I introduced legislation for $15 an hour minimum wage which is better.(APPLAUSE)And ultimately what we have got to determine is after massive transfer of wealth from the middle class to the top 0.1 percent, when millions of our people are working longer hours for low wages...BLITZER: Thank you, Senator.SANDERS: I think we have got to be clear, not equivocate, $15 in minimum wage in 50 states in this country as soon as possible.BLITZER: Thank you.(APPLAUSE)Were going to turn to another critically important issue right now, guns in America. Secretary Clinton, youve said that Vermont, Senator Sanders home state, has, quote, the highest per capita number of guns that end up committing crimes in New York. But only 1.2 percent of the guns recovered in New York in 2014 were from Vermont. Are you seriously blaming Vermont, and implicitly Senator Sanders, for New Yorks gun violence?CLINTON: No, of course not. Of course not. This is  this is a serious difference between us.(LAUGHTER)And what I want to start by saying  its not a laughing matter  90 people on average a day are killed or commit suicide or die in accidents from guns, 33,000 people a year. I take it really seriously, because I have spent more time than I care to remember being with people who have lost their loved ones.So, yes, we have a problem in America. We need a president who will stand up against the gun lobby. We need a president who will fight for commonsense gun safety reforms.(APPLAUSE)And what we have here is a big difference. Senator Sanders voted against the Brady Bill five times. He voted for the most important NRA priority, namely giving immunity from liability to gun-makers and dealers, something that is at the root of a lot of the problems that we are facing.Then he doubled down on that in the New York Daily News interview, when asked whether he would support the Sandy Hook parents suing to try to do something to rein in the advertising of the AR-15, which is advertised to young people as being a combat weapon, killing on the battlefield. He said they didnt deserve their day in court.CLINTON: I could not disagree more.And, finally, this is the only industry in America, the only one.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: That has this kind of special protection. We hear a lot from Senator Sanders about the greed and recklessness of Wall Street, and I agree. Weve got to hold Wall Street accountable...BLITZER: ... Thank you...CLINTON: ... Well, what about the greed and recklessness of gun manufacturers and dealers in America?(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)BLITZER: Senator? Well, the only problem is, Wolf, she didnt answer your question.You asked her whether she thought that Vermont was responsible. You asked her whether she thought that Vermont was responsible for a lot of the gun violence. You made the point what she said was totally absurd.BLITZER: I asked her, are you seriously blaming Vermont and implicitly Senator Sanders for New Yorks gun violence. She said no.

Excuse me, I think Im responding now.BLITZER: Please, go ahead sir.SANDERS: A statement that was refuted by the governor of the state of Vermont, who was a supporter of hers, who said, yeah, in campaigns people tend to exaggerate.Here is the fact on guns. Lets talk about guns. That horrible, horrible Sandy Hook  whats the word we want to use, murder, assault, slaughter, unspeakable act.Back in 1988, I ran for the United States Congress one seat in the state of Vermont. I probably lost that election, which I lost by three points, because I was the only candidate running who said, you know what? We should ban assault weapons, not seen them sold or distributed in the United States of America.Ive got a D-minus voting record from the NRA.(APPLAUSE)And, in fact, because I come from a state which has virtually no gun control, I believe that I am the best qualified candidate to bring back together that consensus that is desperately needed in this country.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Thank you, Senator. Thank you.(CHEERING)BLITZER: Secretary Clinton, I want you to respond to that, but why did you put out that statement blaming Vermont and its gun policy for some of the death of  by guns in New York?CLINTON: Well, the facts are that most of the guns that end up committing crimes in New York come from out of state. They come from the states that dont have kind of serious efforts to control guns that we do in New York.But let me say this  in 1988, as weve heard on every debate occasion, Senator Sanders did run for the Congress and he lost. He came back in 1990 and he won, and during that campaign he made a commitment to the NRA that he would be against waiting periods.And, in fact, in his own book, he talks about his 1990 campaign, and heres what he said. He clearly was helped by the NRA, because they ran ads against his opponent. So, then he went to the Congress, where he has been a largely very reliable supporter of the NRA. Voting  he kept his word to the NRA, he voted against the Brady Bill five times because it had waiting periods in it.Thankfully, enough people finally voted for it to keep guns out of the hands of who should not have them.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Senator, I want you to respond, but I also want you to respond to this. You recently said you do not think crime victims should be able to sue gun makers for damages. The daughter of the Sandy Hook Elementary School who was killed back in the 2012 mass shooting, says you owe her and families an apology. Do you?SANDERS: What we need to do is to do everything that we can to make certain that guns do not fall into the hands of people who do not have them.Now, I voted against this gun liability law because I was concerned that in rural areas all over this country, if a gun shop owner sells a weapon legally to somebody, and that person then goes out and kills somebody, I dont believe it is appropriate that that gun shop owner who just sold a legal weapon to be held accountable and be sued.But, what I do believe is when gun shop owners and others knowingly are selling weapons to people who should not have them  somebody walks in.SANDERS: They want thousands of rounds of ammunition, or they want a whole lot of guns, yes, that gun shop owner or that gun manufacturer should be held liable.BLITZER: So, Senator, do you owe the Sandy Hook families an apology?SANDERS: No, I dont think I owe them an apology. They are in court today, and actually they won a preliminary decision today. They have the right to sue, and I support them and anyone else who wants the right to sue.CLINTON: Well, I believe that the law that Senator Sanders voted for that I voted against, giving this special protection to gun manufacturers and to dealers, is an absolute abdication of responsibility on the part of those who voted for it.This is a  this is a unique gift given to only one industry in the world by the United States Congress, as Senator Murphy from Connecticut said, we have tougher standards holding toy gun manufacturers and sellers to account than we do for real guns.And the point that Senator Sanders keeps making about how he wouldnt want a mom and pop store  that was not the point of this. And if he can point to any, any incident where that happened, I would love to hear about it.What was really going on, Ill tell you, because it has a lot to do with New York City. New York City was on the brink of being able to hold manufacturers and dealers accountable through a very carefully crafted legal strategy.BLITZER: Thank you.CLINTON: The NRA came to their supporters in the Congress and said, stop it, stop it now, and Senator Sanders joined those who did.BLITZER: Thank you, Secretary.Senator, go ahead.SANDERS: Let me just reiterate  just reiterate so there is no confusion, decades ago, before it was popular, in a rural state with no gun control, Bernie Sanders said, lets ban assault weapons, not see them distributed in the United States of America.BLITZER: Thank you, Senator.Lets turn it over to Errol Lewis, of New York 1 Time Warner Cable News.LOUIS: Secretary Clinton, the 1994 crime bill that you supported added 100,000 police officers across the country and banned certain assault weapons. It also imposed tougher prison sentences and eliminated federal funding for inmate education.Looking at the bill as a whole, do you believe it was a net positive or do you think it was a mistake?CLINTON: Well, I think that it had some positive aspects to it. And you mentioned some of them. The Violence Against Women Act, which has been a very important piece of legislation, in my opinion.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: And it also did some things which were to provide more opportunities for young people. So if we were to have the balance sheet on one side, there are some positive actions and changes.On the other side, there were decisions that were made that now we must revisit and we have to correct. I think that sentences got much too long. The original idea was not that we would increase sentences for non-violent low-level offenders, but once the federal government did what it did, states piled on.So we have a problem. And the very first speech I gave in this campaign was about what I will do to reform the criminal justice system and end the over-mass incarceration.So I think that if all of us go and look back at where we were, Senator Sanders voted for the crime bill, and he says the same thing, there were some good things, and things that we have to change and learn from.So thats how I see it. And I think we ought to be putting our attention on forging a consensus to make the changes that will divert more people from the criminal justice system to start.LOUIS: Thank you, Secretary.CLINTON: To tackle systemic racism and divert people in the beginning.LOUIS: Now earlier this year, a South Carolina voter told your daughter Chelsea, quote, I think a lot of African-Americans want to hear, you know what, we made a mistake. Chelsea said she has heard you apologize, but went on to say that if the voter hadnt heard it then, quote, its clearly insufficient.Do you regret your advocacy for the crime bill?CLINTON: Well, look, I supported the crime bill. My husband has apologized. He was the president who actually signed it, Senator Sanders...LOUIS: But what about you, Senator?CLINTON: ... voted for it. Im sorry for the consequences that were unintended and that have had a very unfortunate impact on peoples lives.Ive seen the results of what has happened in families and in communities.CLINTON: Thats why I chose to make my very first speech a year ago on this issue, Errol, because I want to focus the attention of our country and to make the changes we need to make. And I also want people...(APPLAUSE)... especially I want  I want white people  I want white people to recognize that there is systemic racism. Its also in employment, its in housing, but it is in the criminal justice system, as well.(APPLAUSE)LOUIS: Senator Sanders, earlier this week at the Apollo Theater in Harlem, you called out President Clinton for defending Secretary Clintons use of the term super-predator back in the 90s when she supported the crime bill. Why did you call him out?SANDERS: Because it was a racist term, and everybody knew it was a racist term.(APPLAUSE)Look, much of what Secretary Clinton said was right. We had a crime bill. I voted for it. It had the Violence Against Women Act in it. When as mayor of Burlington, we worked very hard to try to eliminate domestic violence. This took us a good step forward. Were talking about the weapon that killed the children in Sandy Hook. This banned assault weapons, not insignificant.But where we are today is we have a broken criminal justice system. We have more people in jail than any other country on Earth. And in my view, what we have got to do is rethink the system from the bottom on up. And that means, for a start  and we dont talk about this. The media doesnt talk about it  you got 51 percent of African-American kids today who graduated high school who are unemployed or underemployed. You know what I think? Maybe we invest in jobs and education for those kids, not jails and incarceration.(APPLAUSE)And Ill tell you what else. And Ill tell you what else I think. And that is, we have got  and this is the difference between the secretary and myself as I understand it. We have got to have the guts to rethink the so-called war on drugs. Too many lives... BLITZER: Thank you, Senator.SANDERS: Too many lives have been destroyed because people possessed marijuana, millions over a 30-year period. And that is why I believe we should take marijuana out of the federal Controlled Substance Act.(APPLAUSE)LOUIS: Thank you. Thank you. Lets  lets get Secretary Clintons response.CLINTON: Well, look, I think that, as Senator Sanders said about what I said, I will say about what he said. I think that we recognize that we have a set of problems that we cannot ignore and we must address. And that is why I have been promoting for my entire adult life, I think, the idea of investing early in kids, early childhood education, universal pre-K, like what Mayor de Blasio brought to New York. We have got to help more kids get off to a good start. Thats why I want a good teacher in a good school for every child, regardless of the ZIP Code that child lives in...LOUIS: Thank you. Thank you, Secretary Clinton.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: ... and to be really focused on how we build ladders of opportunity and tear down these barriers that stand in the way of people getting ahead.LOUIS: Your times up, Secretary Clinton.Senator Sanders, I have a question for you related to this. So youve said that by the end of your first term as president, the U.S. will no longer lead the world in mass incarceration. To fulfill that promise, youd have to release roughly half a million prisoners. How are you going to do that, since the vast majority of American prisoners are not under federal jurisdiction?SANDERS: Were going to work with state governments all over this country. And you know what? In a very divided Congress, and a very divided politics in America, actually the one area where there is some common ground is conservatives understand that its insane to be spending $80 billion a year locking up 2.2 million people.With federal and presidential leadership, we will work with state governments to make sure that people are released from jail under strong supervision, that they get the kind of job training and education they need so they can return to their communities. On this one, Errol, actually I think youre going to see progressive and conservative support. We can do it, if were prepared to be bold.BLITZER: Thank you, Senator. Thank you, Secretary. We have to take a quick commercial break. We have a lot more questions for Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders right after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BLITZER: Welcome back.Lets turn to another critically important issue.Senator, Secretary, the issue of energy and the environment.Secretary Clinton, Senator Sanders has said you are in the pocket of the fossil fuel industry. You say youre sick and tired of him lying about your record.What are his lies?CLINTON: Well, let me start by saying we need to talk about this issue and we should talk about it in terms of the extraordinary threats that climate change pose to our country and our world. And thats why for the last many years, both in the Senate and as secretary of State, its been a big part of my commitment to see what could be done.But there has never been any doubt that when I was a senator, I tried  I joined with others to try to get rid of the subsidies for big oil. And I have proposed that again, because thats what I think needs to be done as we transition from fossil fuels to clean energy.CLINTON: And everyone whos looked at this independently, The Washington Post and others, who give us both hard times when called for on facts, have said that this is absolutely an incorrect false charge.So, we both have relatively small amounts of contributions from people who work for fossil fuel companies. Best we can tell from the reports that are done.But, that is not being supported by big oil, and I think its important to distinguish that. And, lets talk about what each of us has proposed to try to combat greenhouse gas emissions and put us on the fastest track possible to clean energy.BLITZER: Thank you. Were going to get to that to, but I want you to respond, Senator.SANDERS: It is one thing, as the Secretary indicated, to talk about workers. Im sure I have contributions, you have contributions from workers in every industry in the country. But, as I understand it, 43 lobbyists for the fossil fuel industry maxed out, gave the maximum amount of money to Secretary Clintons campaign.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: Now, thats not saying  and, then some people say, well, given the hundreds of millions of dollars she raises its a small amount. Thats true. But, that does not mean to say that the lobbyists thought she was a pretty good bet on this issue.Now, what I think is when we look at climate change now, we have got to realize that this is a global environmental crisis of unprecedented urgency.(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)And, it is not good enough. You know, if we, God forbid, were attacked tomorrow the whole country would rise up and say we got an enemy out there and we got to do something about it. That was what 9/11 was about.We have an enemy out there, and that enemy is going to cause drought and floods and extreme weather disturbances. Theres going to be international conflict.(APPLAUSE) I am proud, Wolf, that I have introduced the most comprehensive climate change legislation...BLITZER: .... Thank you...SANDERS: ... Including a tax on carbon. Something I dont believe Secretary Clinton supports.(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)BLITZER: Secretary Clinton, go ahead and respond.CLINTON: Well, lets talk about the global environmental crisis. Starting in 2009 as your Secretary of State, I worked with President Obama to bring China and India to the table for the very first time, to get a commitment out of them that they would begin to address their own greenhouse gas emissions.(APPLAUSE)I continued to work on that throughout the four years as Secretary of State, and I was very proud that President Obama and America led the way to the agreement that was finally reached in Paris with 195 nations committing to take steps to actually make a difference in climate change.(APPLAUSE)And, I was surprised and disappointed when Senator Sanders attacked the agreement, said it was not enough, it didnt go far enough. You know, at some point putting together 195 countries, I know a little bit about that, was a major accomplishment...BLITZER: ... Thank you...(APPLAUSE CHEERING)CLINTON: ... And, our President led the effort to protect our world and he deserve our appreciation, not our criticism...BLITZER: ... Go ahead, Senator...SANDERS: ... Lets talk about that. When you were Secretary of State, you also worked hard to expand fracking to countries all over the world.(CHEERING)SANDERS: The issue here  of course the agreement is a step forward, but you know agreements and I know agreements, theres a lot of paper there. Weve got to get beyond paper right now.We have got to lead the world in transforming our energy system, not tomorrow, but yesterday.(APPLAUSE) And, what that means, Wolf, it means having the guts to take on the fossil fuel industry. Now, I am on board legislation that says, you know what, we aint going to excavate for fossil fuel on public land. Thats not Secretary Clintons position.BLITZER: Thank you.Let us support a tax on carbon...BLITZER: ... Secretary Clinton...SANDERS: ... Not Secretary Clintons position.BLITZER: ... Go ahead and respond.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: Well, Im a little bewildered about how to respond when you have an agreement which gives you the framework to actually take the action that would have only come about because under the Obama administration in the face of implacable hostility from the Republicans in Congress, President Obama moved forward on gas mileage, he moved forward on the clean power plant. He has moved forward on so many of the fronts that he could given the executive actions that he was able to take.(APPLAUSE)And, you know, I am getting a little bit  Im getting a little bit concerned here because, you know, I really believe that the President has done an incredible job against great odds and deserves to be supported.(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)CLINTON: Now, its easy  its easy to diagnose the problem. Its harder to do something about the problem. And...(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Thank you, Secretary. Well continue on this. Errol  Errol Louis, go ahead with your question.SANDERS: Wolf. Wolf.BLITZER: Were going to continue on this. Errol, go ahead.LOUIS: OK. Secretary Clinton, as secretary of state, you also pioneered a program to promote fracking around the world, as you described. Fracking, of course, a way of extracting natural gas. Now as a candidate for president, you say that by the time youre done with all your rules and regulations, fracking will be restricted in many places around the country. Why have you changed your view on fracking?CLINTON: No, well, I dont think Ive changed my view on what we need to do to go from where we are, where the world is heavily dependent on coal and oil, but principally coal, to where we need to be, which is clean renewable energy, and one of the bridge fuels is natural gas.And so for both economic and environmental and strategic reasons, it was American policy to try to help countries get out from under the constant use of coal, building coal plants all the time, also to get out from under, especially if they were in Europe, the pressure from Russia, which has been incredibly intense. So we did say natural gas is a bridge. We want to cross that bridge as quickly as possible, because in order to deal with climate change, we have got to move as rapidly as we can.Thats why Ive set big goals. I want to see us deploy a half a billion more solar panels by the end of my first term and enough clean energy to provide electricity to every home in America within 10 years.(APPLAUSE)So I have big, bold goals, but I know in order to get from where we are, where the world is still burning way too much coal, where the world is still too intimidated by countries and providers like Russia, we have got to make a very firm but decisive move in the direction of clean energy.LOUIS: Thank you, Secretary. All right, Senator?SANDERS: All right, here is  here is a real difference. This is a difference between understanding that we have a crisis of historical consequence here, and incrementalism and those little steps are not enough.(APPLAUSE)Not right now. Not on climate change. Now, the truth is, as secretary of state, Secretary Clinton actively supported fracking technology around the world. Second of all, right now, we have got to tell the fossil fuel industry that their short-term profits are not more important than the future of this planet.(APPLAUSE)And that means  and I would ask you to respond. Are you in favor of a tax on carbon so that we can transit away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy at the level and speed we need to do?(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: You know, I have laid out a set of actions that build on what President Obama was able to accomplish, building on the clean power plan, which is currently under attack by fossil fuels and the right in the Supreme Court, which is one of the reasons why we need to get the Supreme Court justice that President Obama has nominated to be confirmed so that we can actually continue to make progress.I dont take a back seat to your legislation that youve introduced that you havent been able to get passed. I want to do what we can do to actually make progress in dealing with the crisis. Thats exactly what I have proposed.LOUIS: OK, thank you, Secretary Clinton.CLINTON: And my approach I think is going to get us there faster without tying us up into political knots with a Congress that still would not support what you are proposing.(CROSSTALK)LOUIS: Senator Sanders, youve said that climate change is the greatest change to our nations security.SANDERS: Secretary Clinton did not answer one simple question.LOUIS: Excuse me, Senator, Senator, Senator, Senator, Senator...SANDERS: Are you for a tax on carbon or not? LOUIS: I have a question for you. Youve said that climate change is the greatest threat to our nations security. Youve called for a nationwide ban on fracking. Youve also called for phasing out all nuclear power in the U.S. But wouldnt those proposals drive the country back to coal and oil, and actually undermine your fight against global warming?SANDERS: No, they wouldnt. Look, heres where we are. Let me reiterate. We have a global crisis. Pope Francis reminded us that we are on a suicide course. Our legislation understands, Errol, that there will be economic dislocation. It is absolutely true. There will be some people who lose their job. And we build into our legislation an enormous amount of money to protect those workers. It is not their fault...SANDERS: It is not their fault that fossil fuels are destroying our climate.But we have got to stand up and say right now, as we would if we were attacked by some military force, we have got to move urgency  urgently and boldly.What does that mean?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Senator  senator, jobs...SANDERS: Yes?UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  jobs are one thing, but with less than 6 percent of all U.S. energy coming from solar, wind and geothermal, and 20 percent of U.S. power coming from nuclear, if you phase out all of that, how do you make up...SANDERS: Well, you dont phase...UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  that difference?SANDERS:  it all out tomorrow. And you certainly dont phase nuclear out tomorrow. But this is what you do do.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: What you do do is say that we are going to have a massive program  and I had introduced  introduced legislation for 10 million solar rooftops. We can put probably millions of people to work retrofitting and weatherizing buildings all over this country.(CHEERING)SANDERS: Saving  rebuilding our rail system.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: Our mass transit system.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: If we approach this, Errol, as if we were literally at a war  you know, in 1941, under Franklin Delano Roosevelt, we moved within three years, within three more years to rebuild our economy to defeat Nazism and Japanese imperialism. That is exactly the kind of approach we need right now.BLITZER: Thank you.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: Lead the world.BLITZER: Thank you, Senator.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Lets turn to another critically important issue...(APPLAUSE)BLITZER:  the issue of national security and foreign policy.Secretary Clinton, President Obama says the worst mistake in office that he made over these past seven and a half years was not preparing for Libya after Moammar Qadafi was removed. You were his secretary of State.Arent you also responsible for that?CLINTON: Well, let me say I think we did a great deal to help the Libyan people after Qadafis demise. And heres what we did.We helped them hold two successful elections, something that is not easy, which they did very well because they had a pent up desire to try to chart their own future after 42 years of dictatorship.I was very proud of that.We got rid of the chemical weapons stockpile that Qadafi had, getting it out of Libya, getting it away from militias or terrorist groups.We also worked to help them set up their government. We sent a lot of American experts there. We offered to help them secure their borders, to train a new military.They, at the end, when it came to security issues, Wolf, did not want troops from any other country, not just us, European or other countries, in Libya.And so we were caught in a very difficult position. They could not provide security on their own, which we could see and we told them that, but they didnt want to have others helping to provide that security.And the result has been a clash between different parts of the country, terrorists taking up some locations in the country.And we cant walk away from that. We need to be working with European and Arab partners...BLITZER: Thank you.CLINTON:  with the United Nations in order to continue to try to support them.The Libyan people deserve a chance at democracy and self- government. And I, as president, will keep trying to give that to themBLITZER: Senator, go ahead.SANDERS: According to The New York Times...(APPLAUSE)SANDERS:  for President Obama, this was a pretty tough call, like a 51-49 call, do you overthrow Qadafi, who, of course, was a horrific dictator?The New York Times told us it was Secretary Clinton who led the effect for that regime change. And this is the same type of mentality that supported the war in Iraq.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: Look...(APPLAUSE)SANDERS:  Qadafi, Saddam Hussein are brutal, brutal murdering thugs. No debate about that.But what we have got to do and what the president was saying is we didnt think thoroughly about what happens the day after you get rid of these dictators.Regime change often has unintended consequences in Iraq and in Libya right now, where ISIS has a very dangerous foothold. And I think if you studied the whole history of...BLITZER: Yes.SANDERS:  American involvement in regime change, you see that quite often.BLITZER: Secretary, were going to let you respond.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: Yes, well, I...(APPLAUSE)CLINTON:  I...(APPLAUSE)CLINTON:  I  I would just point out that there was a vote in the Senate as to whether or not the United States should support the efforts by the Libyan people to protect themselves against the threats, the genocidal threats coming from Gadhafi, and whether we should go to the United Nations to seek Security Council support.Senator sanders voted for that, and thats exactly what we did.SANDERS: No.(CROSSTALK)CLINTON: We went to the United Nations  yes, he did. We went to the United Nations Security Council. We got support from the Security Council. And we then supported the efforts of our European and Arab allies and partners.This was a request made to our government by the Europeans and by the Arabs because of their great fear of what chaos in Syria would do to them. And if you want to know what chaos does, not just to the people inside but the people on the borders, look at Syria.Nobody stood up to Assad and removed him, and we have had a far greater disaster in Syria than we are currently dealing with right now in Libya.(APPLAUSE)(CROSSTALK)BLITZER: Senator, go ahead.SANDERS: Secretary Clinton made this charge in previous debates and just repeating it doesnt make it truer. What you are talking about is what I think was what they call the unanimous consent, you know what that is, where basically, do we support Libya moving to democracy?Well, you know what, I surely have always supported Libya moving to democracy. But please do not confuse that with your active effort for regime change without contemplating what happened the day after. Totally different issue.CLINTON: Well, that isnt...SANDERS: Second of all  second of all, if I might, in terms of Syria, in terms of Syria...BLITZER: Senator, let her respond to that, then well get to that.Go ahead, Secretary.CLINTON: There was also in that a reference to the Security Council, and I know youre not shy when you oppose something, Senator. So, yes, it was unanimous. Thats exactly right, including you.And what we did was to try to provide support for our European and Arab allies and partners. The decision was the presidents. Did I do the due diligence? Did I talk to everybody I could talk to? Did I visit every capital and then report back to the president? Yes, I did. Thats what a secretary of state does.But at the end of the day, those are the decisions that are made by the president to in any way use American military power. And the president made that decision. And, yes, we did try without success because of the Libyans obstruction to our efforts, but we did try and we will continue to try to help the Libyan people.BLITZER: Thank you, Secretary.Go ahead, Senator.SANDERS: If you listen, you know  two points. Number one, yes, 100-0 in the Senate voted for democracy in Libya and I would vote for that again. But that is very different from getting actively involved to overthrow and bring about regime change without fully understanding what the consequence of that regime change would be.Second of all, I know you keep referring to Barack Obama all night here, but you in Syria, you in Syria talked about a no-fly zone, which the president certainly does not support, nor do I support because, A, it will cost an enormous sum of money, second of all, it runs the risk of getting us sucked into perpetual warfare in that region.Thirdly, when we talk about Syria right now, no debate, like Gadhafi, like Saddam Hussein, Assad is another brutal murdering dictator, but right now our fight is to destroy ISIS first, and to get rid of Assad second.CLINTON: Well, I think Senator Sanders has just reinforced my point. Yes, when I was secretary of state I did urge, along with the Department of Defense and the CIA that we seek out, vet, and train, and arm Syrian opposition figures so that they could defend themselves against Assad.The president said no. Now, thats how it works. People who work for the president make recommendations and then the president makes the decision. So I think its only fair to look at where we are in Syria today.And, yes, I do still support a no-fly zone because I think we need to put in safe havens for those poor Syrians who are fleeing both Assad and ISIS and have some place that they can be safe.BLITZER: Staying on national security, Dana Bash has a question.BASH: Senator Sanders, in 1997, you said this about NATO, you said, quote: It is not the time to continue wasting tens of billions of dollars helping to defend Europe, let alone assuming more than our share of any cost associated with expanding NATO.Do you still feel that way?SANDERS: Well, what I believe, if my memory is correct here, we spend about 75 percent of the entire cost of the military aspect of NATO. Given the fact that France has a very good health care system and free public education, college education for their people, the U.K. has a good National Health Service and they also provide fairly reasonable higher education, you know what, yeah, I do believe that the countries of Europe should pick up more of the burden for their defense. Yes, I do.(APPLAUSE)BASH: And just following up, Senator Sanders, Donald Trump also argues that NATO is unfair economically to the U.S. because America pays a disproportionate share. So how is what you say about NATO and your proposal different than his?SANDERS: Well, you got to ask  you got to ask Trump. All I can tell you is, with a huge deficit, with 47 million people living in poverty, with our inner cities collapsing, yeah, I do think countries like Germany and U.K. and France and European countries whose economy, or at least its standard of living and health care and education, theyre doing pretty well.So I would not be embarrassed as president of the United States to stay to our European allies, you know what, the United States of America cannot just support your economies. You got to put up your own fair share of the defense burden. Nothing wrong with that.(APPLAUSE)BASH: Secretary Clinton?CLINTON: I support our continuing involvement in NATO. And it is important to ask for our NATO allies to pay more of the cost. There is a requirement that they should be doing so, and I believe that needs to be enforced.But theres a larger question here. NATO has been the most successful military alliance in probably human history. It has bound together across the Atlantic countries that are democracies, that have many of the same values and interests, and now we need to modernize it and move it into the 21st century to serve as that head of our defense operations in Europe when it comes to terrorism and other threats that we face. So...BASH: But, Madam Secretary... CLINTON: ... yes, of course they should be paying more, but that doesnt mean if they dont we leave, because I dont think thats in Americas interests.BASH: Thats going to be part of my  my question to you is, to that point, there are 28 countries in the alliance, and the United States gives more money to NATOs budget than 21 of those countries combined. If they dont agree to pay more, as you suggested, then what would you do as commander-in-chief?CLINTON: I will stay in NATO. I will stay in NATO, and we will continue to look for missions and other kinds of programs that they will support. Remember, NATO was with us in Afghanistan. Most of the member countries also lost soldiers and civilians in Afghanistan. They came to our rallying defense after 9/11. That meant a lot.And, yes, we have to work out the financial aspects of it, but lets not forget whats really happening. With Russia being more aggressive, making all kinds of intimidating moves toward the Baltic countries, weve seen what theyve done in Eastern Ukraine, we know how they want to rewrite the map of Europe, it is not in our interests. Think of how much it would cost if Russias aggression were not deterred because NATO was there on the front lines making it clear they could not move forward.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Thank you, Secretary.Senator, lets talk about the U.S. relationship with Israel. Senator Sanders, you maintained that Israels response in Gaza in 2014 was, quote, disproportionate and led to the unnecessary loss of innocent life.(APPLAUSE)What do you say to those who believe that Israel has a right to defend itself as it sees fit?SANDERS: Well, as somebody who spent many months of my life when I was a kid in Israel, who has family in Israel, of course Israel has a right not only to defend themselves, but to live in peace and security without fear of terrorist attack. That is not a debate.(APPLAUSE)But  but what you just read, yeah, I do believe that. Israel was subjected to terrorist attacks, has every right in the world to destroy terrorism. But we had in the Gaza area  not a very large area  some 10,000 civilians who were wounded and some 1,500 who were killed.AUDIENCE MEMBER: Free Palestine!SANDERS: Now, if youre asking not just me, but countries all over the world was that a disproportionate attack, the answer is that I believe it was, and let me say something else.(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)SANDERS: And, let me say something else. As somebody who is 100% pro-Israel, in the long run  and this is not going to be easy, God only knows, but in the long run if we are ever going to bring peace to that region which has seen so much hatred and so much war, we are going to have to treat the Palestinian people with respect and dignity.(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)SANDERS: So what is not to say  to say that right now in Gaza, right now in Gaza unemployment is s somewhere around 40%. You got a log of that area continues, it hasnt been built, decimated, houses decimated health care decimated, schools decimated. I believe the United States and the rest of the world have got to work together to help the Palestinian people.That does not make me anti-Israel. That paves the way, I think...BLITZER: ... Thank you, Senator...SANDERS: ...to an approach that works in the Middle East.(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)BLITZER: Thank you. Secretary Clinton, do you agree with Senator Sanders that Israel overreacts to Palestinians attacks, and that in order for there to be peace between Israel and the Palestinians, Israel must, quote, end its disproportionate responses?CLINTON: I negotiated the cease-fire between Israel and Hamas in November of 2012. I did it in concert with...(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: President Abbas of the Palestinian authority based in Ramallah, I did it with the then Muslim Brotherhood President, Morsi, based in Cairo, working closely with Prime Minister Netanyahu and the Israeli cabinet. I can tell you right now I have been there with Israeli officials going back more than 25 years that they do not seek this kind of attacks. They do not invite the rockets raining down on their towns and villages.(APPLAUSE)They do not believe that there should be a constant incitement by Hamas aided and abetted by Iran against Israel. And, so when it came time after they had taken the incoming rockets, taken the assaults and ambushes on their soldiers and they called and told me, I was in Cambodia, that they were getting ready to have to invade Gaza again because they couldnt find anybody to talk to tell them to stop it, I flew all night, I got there, I negotiated that.So, I dont know how you run a country when you are under constant threat, terrorist tact, rockets coming at you. You have a right to defend yourself.(APPLAUSE)That does not mean  that does not mean that you dont take appropriate precautions. And, I understand that theres always second guessing anytime there is a war. It also does not mean that we should not continue to do everything we can to try to reach a two-state solution, which would give the Palestinians the rights and...BLITZER: ... Thank you...CLINTON: ... just let me finish. The rights and the autonomy that they deserve. And, let me say this, if Yasser Arafat had agreed with my husband at Camp David in the Late 1990s to the offer then Prime Minister Barat put on the table, we would have had a Palestinian state for 15 years.(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)BLITZER: Thank you, Senator, go ahead  go ahead, Senator.SANDERS: I dont think that anybody would suggest that Israel invites and welcomes missiles flying into their country. That is not the issue.And, you evaded the answer. You evaded the question. The question is not does Israel have a right to respond, nor does Israel have a right to go after terrorists and destroy terrorism. Thats not the debate. Was their response disproportionate?I believe that it was, you have not answered that.(CHEERING)CLINTON: I will certainly be willing to answer it. I think I did answer it by saying that of course there have to be precautions taken but even the most independent analyst will say the way that Hamas places its weapons, the way that it often has its fighters in civilian garb, it is terrible.(AUDIENCE REACTION)Im not saying its anything other than terrible. It would be great  remember, Israel left Gaza. They took out all the Israelis. They turned the keys over to the Palestinian people.CLINTON: And what happened? Hamas took over Gaza.So instead of having a thriving economy with the kind of opportunities that the children of the Palestinians deserve, we have a terrorist haven that is getting more and more rockets shipped in from Iran and elsewhere.BLITZER: Thank you, Secretary.Senator.SANDERS: I read Secretary Clintons statement speech before AIPAC. I heard virtually no discussion at all about the needs of the Palestinian people. Almost none in that speech.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: So here is the issue: of course Israel has a right to defend itself, but long term there will never be peace in that region unless the United States plays a role, an even-handed role trying to bring people together and recognizing the serious problems that exist among the Palestinian people.That is what I believe the world wants to us do and thats the kind of leadership that we have got to exercise.CLINTON: Well, if I  I want to add, you know, again describing the problem is a lot easier than trying to solve it. And I have been involved, both as first lady with my husbands efforts, as a senator supporting the efforts that even the Bush administration was undertaking, and as secretary of state for President Obama, Im the person who held the last three meetings between the president of the Palestinian Authority and the prime minister of Israel.There were only four of us in the room, Netanyahu, Abbas, George Mitchell, and me. Three long meetings. And I was absolutely focused on what was fair and right for the Palestinians.I was absolutely focused on what we needed to do to make sure that the Palestinian people had the right to self-government. And I believe that as president I will be able to continue to make progress and get an agreement that will be fair both to the Israelis and the Palestinians without ever, ever undermining Israels security.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: A final word, Senator, go ahead.SANDERS: There comes a time  there comes a time when if we pursue justice and peace, we are going to have to say that Netanyahu is not right all of the time.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: Well...BLITZER: Secretary.CLINTON: ... you know, I have spoken about and written at some length the very candid conversations Ive had with him and other Israeli leaders. Nobody is saying that any individual leader is always right, but it is a difficult position.If you are from whatever perspective trying to seek peace, trying to create the conditions for peace when there is a terrorist group embedded in Gaza that does not want to see you exist, that is a very difficult challenge.BLITZER: Senator, go ahead.SANDERS: You gave a major speech to AIPAC, which obviously deals with the Middle East crisis, and you barely mentioned the Palestinians. And I think, again, it is a complicated issue and God knows for decades presidents, including President Clinton and others, Jimmy Carter and others have tried to do the right thing.All that I am saying is we cannot continue to be one-sided. There are two sides to the issue.BLITZER: Thank you, Senator. Thank you, Secretary.We have to take another quick, quick break. But much more on the CNN Democratic presidential debate live from Brooklyn, New York. That is coming up right after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BLITZER: Welcome back to the CNN presidential debate. Were here in Brooklyn. Secretary, Senator, both of you talk about major reforms to college tuition, health care, and Social Security, all of which will take significant changes from Congress, currently controlled by Republicans.Senator Sanders, youre promising health care and free college for all, and those plans would be met with both political and practical challenges. The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget says your initiatives would cost up to $28 trillion and, even after massive tax increases, that would add as much as $15 trillion to the national debt. How is this fiscally responsible?SANDERS: Well, first of all, I disagree with that study. There are many economists who come up with very, very different numbers.For example, we are the only country, major country on Earth, that does not guarantee health care to all people, and yet we end up spending almost three times what the British do, 50 percent more than the French. My proposal, a Medicare-for-all, single-payer program, will save...(APPLAUSE)... will save middle-class families many thousands of dollars a year in their health care costs. Public colleges and universities tuition free? Damn right. That is exactly what we should be doing.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: And Id pay for that  Id pay for that by telling Wall Street that, yeah, we are going to have a tax on Wall Street speculation, which will bring in more than enough money to provide free tuition at public colleges and universities and lower the outrageous level of student debt.Wolf, we have seen in the last 30 years a massive transfer of wealth from the middle class to the top 0.1 percent. The establishment does not like this idea, but, yes, I am determined to transfer that money back to the working families of this country.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Thank you, Senator. Secretary, go ahead and respond.CLINTON: Well, again  again, I absolutely agree with the diagnosis, the diagnosis that weve got to do much more to finish the work of getting universal health care coverage, something that Ive worked on for 25 years. Before there was something called Obamacare, there was something called Hillarycare. And were now at 90 percent of coverage; Im going to get us to 100 percent.And with respect to college, I think we have to make college affordable. We are pricing out middle-class, working, and poor families. Theres no doubt about that.But I do think when you make proposals and youre running for president, you should be held accountable for whether or not the numbers add up and whether or not the plans...(APPLAUSE)... are actually going to work. And just very briefly, on health care, most of the people who have analyzed what Senator Sanders put out  remember, he had a plan for about, I dont know,18, 20 years. He changed in the middle of this campaign. He put out another plan. People have been analyzing the new plan. And there is no doubt by those who have analyzed it, progressive economists, health economists, and the like, that it would pose an incredible burden, not just on the budget, but on individuals. In fact, the Washington Post called it a train-wreck for the poor. A working woman on Medicaid who already has health insurance would be expected to pay about $2,300.The same for free college. The free college offer  you know, my late father said, if somebody promises you something for free, read the fine print. You read the fine print, and heres what it says.BLITZER: Thank you, Secretary.CLINTON: The fine print says this, that it will  the federal government will cover two-thirds of the cost and require the states, even those led by Republican governors...BLITZER: Senator, go ahead. Thank you.CLINTON: ... to carry out what the remaining one-third of the cost.SANDERS: I know what Secretary Clinton is saying.BLITZER: Secretary please.SANDERS: We are not a country that has the courage to stand up to big money and do what has to be done for the working families of the country.(APPLAUSE)Secretary Clinton will have to explain to the people of our country how it could be that every other major country on Earth manages to guarantee health care to all of their people, spending significantly less per capita than we can.I live 50 miles away from Canada, you know? Its not some kind of communist authoritarian country. Theyre doing OK. They got a health care system that guarantees health care to all people. We can do the same.In terms of public colleges and universities, please dont tell me that we cannot do what many other countries around the world are doing. Kids should not be punished and leave school deeply in debt, for what crime? For trying to get an education.BLITZER: Thank you, Senator.SANDERS: So, yes, we are going to pay for it...CLINTON: Well...BLITZER: Secretary Clinton  Secretary Clinton, go ahead.CLINTON: We have  we have a difference of opinion. We both want to get to universal health care coverage. I did stand up to the special interests and the powerful forces, the health insurance companies and the drug companies.(APPLAUSE)And perhaps thats why I am so much in favor of supporting President Obamas signature accomplishment with the Affordable Care Act, because I know how hard it was to get that passed, even with a Democratic Congress. So rather than letting the Republicans repeal it or rather starting all over again, trying to throw the country into another really contentious debate, lets make the Affordable Care Act work for everybody...BLITZER: Thank you, Secretary.CLINTON: ... lets get to 100 percent coverage, lets get the cost down, and lets guarantee health care.BLITZER: Secretary, lets talk about Social Security, another critically important issue. Senator Sanders has challenged you to give a clear answer when it comes to extending the life of Social Security and expanding benefits. Are you prepared to lift the cap on taxable income, which currently stands at $118,500? Yes or no, would you lift the cap?CLINTON: I have said repeatedly, Wolf, I am going to make the wealthy pay into Social Security to extend the Social Security Trust Fund. That is one way. If that is the way that we pursue, I will follow that.CLINTON: But there are other ways. We should be looking at taxing passive income by wealthy people. We should be looking at taxing all of their investment.But heres the real issue, because I  Ive heard this, Ive seen the reports of it. I have said from the very beginning, we are going to protect Social Security. I was one of the leaders in the fight against Bush when he was trying to privatize Social Security.But we also, in addition to extending the Trust Fund, which I am absolutely determined to do, weve got to help people who are not being taken care of now. And because Social Security started in the 1930s, a lot of women have been left out and left behind.And its time that we provide more benefits for widows, divorcees, for caregivers, for women who deserve more from the Social Security...BLITZER: Thank you, Secretary.CLINTON:  system and that will be my highest priority.BLITZER: Senator?Go ahead, Senator.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: An interesting comment, but you didnt answer the question.CLINTON: I did. If thats the way were...SANDERS: No, you didnt. My legi...CLINTON:  yes, I did.SANDERS: Can I answer...CLINTON: I did answer the...SANDERS:  may I please...CLINTON: Well, dont  dont put words...SANDERS:  can I have... (CROSSTALK)CLINTON:  into my mouth and say something...SANDERS:  do I not?CLINTON:  thats not accurate.BLITZER: Go ahead, Senator.SANDERS: All right. Essentially what you described is my legislation, which includes (INAUDIBLE)...(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: Now, weve got  here is the issue. Your answer has been the same year after year. In fact, the idea that Im bringing forth, I have to admit it, you know, it wasnt my idea. It was Barack Obamas idea in 2008, the exact same idea.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: He called for lifting the cap, which is now higher  its at 118  and starting at 250 and going on up. If you do that, youre going to extend the life of Social Security for 58 years. You will significantly expand benefits by 1,300 bucks a year for seniors and disabled vets under $16,000 a year.Whats wrong with that?Are you prepared to support it?CLINTON: I have supported it. You know, we are in vigorous agreement here, Senator.SANDERS: You have sup...CLINTON: I think its important...(APPLAUSE)CLINTON:  to point out that...(APPLAUSE)CLINTON:  you know, were  were having a discussion about the best way to raise money from wealthy people to extend the Social Security Trust Fund. Think about what the other side wants to do. Theyre calling Social Security a Ponzi scheme. They still want to privatize it.In fact, their whole idea is to turn over the Social Security Trust Fund to Wall Street, something you and I would never let happen.SANDERS: All right, so...CLINTON: So, yes, we both want to make sure...(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: Look, Wolf...CLINTON:  Social Security (INAUDIBLE)...SANDERS:  I am very glad that...(CROSSTALK)CLINTON:  and well-funded...SANDERS: I am very glad to...(CROSSTALK)BLITZER: Thank you, Secretary.(CROSSTALK)BLITZER: Senator, go ahead.SANDERS:  campaign of challenging, if I hear you correctly, Madam Secretary, you are now coming out finally in favor of lifting the cap on taxable income...(APPLAUSE)SANDERS:  and extending and expanding Social Security. If that is the case, welcome on board. Im glad youre here.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: No.BLITZER: Thank you.Errol  Errol Louis, go ahead.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: We are going...(APPLAUSE)CLINTON:  we are...(APPLAUSE)CLINTON:  we are going...LOUIS: Secretary...CLINTON: I  as he said, Ive said the same thing for years. I didnt say anything different tonight. We are going to extend the Social Security Trust Fund. There is still something called Congress. Now, I happen to support Democrats and I want to get Democrats to take back the majority in the United States Senate...BLITZER: Errol...CLINTON:  so a lot of  a lot of what were talking about can actually be implemented...BLITZER: Errol, hold on a second.CLINTON:  when I am president.LOUIS: Secretary...BLITZER: Go ahead.Hold on, Errol...SANDERS:  Im still...BLITZER:  Errol. Hold on.SANDERS: Ive got to admit...BLITZER: Go ahead, Senator.SANDERS:  maybe Im a little bit confused.Are you or are you not supporting legislation to lift the cap on taxable income and expand Social Security for 58 years and increase benefits...CLINTON: I am...SANDERS:  yes or no?CLINTON: I have said yes, we are going to pick the best way or combination...SANDERS: Oh, you  ah.(APPLAUSE)(BOOS)SANDERS: OK.CLINTON:  or combination of ways...(BOOS)CLINTON:  you know...(BOOS)CLINTON:  it  its all  its always a little bit, uh, challenging because, you know, if Senator Sanders doesnt agree with how you are approaching something, then you are a member of the establishment.Well, let me say then...SANDERS: Well, look...(APPLAUSE)CLINTON:  let me say this...(APPLAUSE)CLINTON:  we are going to extend the Social Security Trust Fund. Weve got some good ideas to do it. Lets get a Congress elected...BLITZER: Thank you.CLINTON:  that will actually agree...BLITZER: Well, thank you...CLINTON:  with us in doing it.BLITZER: Errol, go ahead.LOUIS: OK, Secretary Clinton, Ive got a question for you from a reader...(CROSSTALK)SANDERS: Let me interject here.LOUIS:  of the New York Daily News.SANDERS: Yes, Secretary Clinton...(CROSSTALK)SANDERS:  you are a member of the establishment.LOUIS:  this was a reader...SANDERS: (INAUDIBLE).LOUIS:  of The Daily News who sent us a...(CHEERING)LOUIS:  a question for you.LOUIS: Just a second, Senator.Hannah Green (ph) wants to know your position, Secretary Clinton, regarding President Obamas nomination of Merrick Gaarland to the Supreme m Court. President Obama said earlier this week that he would not withdraw the nomination, even after the presidential election. If elected, would you ask the president to withdraw the nomination?CLINTON: I am not going to contradict the presidents strategy on this. And Im not going to engage in hypotheticals. I fully support the president.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: And I believe that the president  the president is on the right side of both the Constitution and history. And the Senate needs to immediately begin to respond. So Im going to support the president. When I am president, I will take stock of where we are and move from there.LOUIS: Senator Sanders.SANDERS: Well, there is no question. I mean, it really is an outrage. And it just continues, the seven-and-a-half years of unbelievable obstructionism we have seen from these right-wing Republicans.I mean, a third-grader in America understands the president of the United States has the right to nominate individuals to the U.S. Supreme Court. Apparently everybody understands that except the Republicans in Congress.LOUIS: So, Senator Sanders, would you ask him to withdraw the nomination?SANDERS: Yes, but here is the point, and obviously i will strongly support that nomination as a member of the Senate. But, if elected president, I would ask the president to withdraw that nomination because I think  I think this.I think that we need a Supreme Court justice who will make it crystal clear, and this nominee has not yet done that, crystal clear that he or she will vote to overturn Citizens United and make sure that American democracy is not undermined.(APPLAUSE) CLINTON: You know, there is no doubt that the only people that I would ever appoint to the Supreme Court are people who believe that Roe V. Wade is settled law and Citizens United needs to be overturned.And I want to say something about this since were talking about the Supreme Court and whats at stake. Weve had eight debates before, this is our ninth. Weve not had one question about a womans right to make her own decisions about reproductive health care, not one question.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: And in the meantime we have states, governors doing everything they can to restrict womens rights. We have a presidential candidate by the name of Donald Trump saying that women should be punished. And we are never asked about this.And to be complete in my concern, Senator Sanders says with respect to Trump it was a distraction. I dont think its a distraction. It goes to the heart of who we are as women, our rights, our autonomy, our ability to make our own decisions, and we need to be talking about that and defending Planned Parenthood from these outrageous attacks.BASH: Senator Sanders, your response.SANDERS: Youre looking at a senator and former congressman who proudly has a 100 percent pro-choice voting record, who will take on those Republican governors who are trying to restrict a womans right to choose, who will take on those governors right now who are discriminating outrageously against the LGBT community, who comes from a state which led the effort for gay marriage in this country, proudly so.(APPLAUSE)BASH: Thank you, Senator.SANDERS: Who not only thinks we are not going to  not defund Planned Parenthood, weve got to expand funding for Planned Parenthood.(APPLAUSE)BASH: Senator Sanders, youve spoken a lot tonight about your votes in Congress. You have been in Congress for over a quarter of the century, and there as an independent, not a Democrat.Now youre seeking the Democratic nomination, but Secretary Clinton has suggested that shes not even sure you are a Democrat. Are you?SANDERS: Well, why would I be running for the Democratic nomination to be president of the United States?(APPLAUSE) SANDERS: But here is a good point. You know, in virtually all of the general election match-up polls between Trump and Secretary Clinton and Trump and Bernie Sanders, in almost all of those polls, I do better than Secretary Clinton both in the CNN poll I was 20 points ahead of Trump.I think Secretary Clinton was 12 points. And you know why? Because in fact a whole lot of people  this may be a shock to the secretary, but there a whole lot of independents in this country.(APPLAUSE)BASH: Senator Sanders...SANDERS: And we are not going to win the White House based on just long-term Democratic votes. We have got to reach out to independents and I think I am well qualified to do that.BASH: Senator Sanders.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: I am in this race as a Democrat. I have raised millions of dollars for my colleagues in the United States Senate to help them get elected. I will do everything I can to open the Democratic party to the young people who are flocking into our political campaign.(CHEERING)BASH: On that very subject, on that very subject, Secretary Clinton mentions electing a Democratic congress several times. She says that she raised $15 million for the Democratic party in the first three months of this year. You dont appear to have raised any money for the party. Yesterday you did announce that you will help three members of Congress who have endorsed you. Why arent you doing more to help the party you say you want to lead?SANDERS: The truth is, and you can speak to my colleagues, we have raised millions of dollars to the DSCC. I have written letter that have raised, if I may use the word, huge amount of money so thats just not accurate.But, I will also say, and this is important and maybe the Secretary disagrees with me, but I am proud that millions of young people who previously were not involved in the political process are now coming into it, and I do believe, I do believe that we have got to open the door of the Democratic party to those people.(APPLAUSE)And, I think the future of the Democratic party is not simply by raising money from wealthy campaign contributors. I think that the way we are doing it in this campaign...BASH: ... Thank you Senator.SANDERS: $27 a contribution...BASH: ... Senator, your time is up...SANDERS; not being dependent on Wall Street, or big money, that is the future of the Democratic Party that I want to see.(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)BASH: Thank you, Senator Sanders. Secretary Clinton.CLINTON: Let us talk about where we are in this race. Ive gotten more votes than anybody running. 9.6 million at the last count.(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)That is 2.3 million more than Senator Sanders.(APPLAUSE)And it is 1.4 million more than Donald Trump.(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)I think you have to look at the facts. And, the facts are that Im putting together a very broad-based, inclusive coalition from the South to the North, from the East to the West, with African-American, Latinos, women, union households, working people and I am very proud of the campaign we are running. It is a campaign that will not only capture the Democratic nomination, but a campaign that will defeat whoever the Republican end up nominating.(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)BASH: Thank you, Madam Secretary. Senator Sanders.(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)CLINTON: And, I want to say  I also want to say that I do  I do think it is absolutely critical and incredible that we have so many young people involved in the political process. I applaud all of those who are applauding you, Senator Sanders. Were happy that they are supporting you, that they are passionately committed to you and to the issues.But, let me also say its going to be important that we unify the Democratic party when the nomination process has been completed...BASH: ... Secretary Clinton, thank you.CLINTON: And, I know something about that...BASH: ... Secretary Clinton...CLINTON: Thank you so much. Because, when I went to the very end of the 2008 campaign with then Senator Obama...BASH: ...Secretary Clinton, youre out of time...CLINTON: ... We did unify the party, and we did elect a Democratic president...BASH: ...Senator Sanders, on that note....SANDERS: ... Let me, if I may just briefly say something...BASH: ... Senator Sanders, I want to ask you a question about this, and you can incorporate that into your response. Three months now between now and the Democratic convention. Your campaign manager says that you will absolutely take the fight to the floor if neither you nor Secretary Clinton clinches the nomination with pledged delegates alone.(APPLAUSE)BASH: Do you vow to take this fight to Philadelphia no matter what?SANDERS: I think were going to win this nomination to tell you the truth.(CHEERING)SANDERS: Look, let me acknowledge what is absolutely true. Secretary Clinton cleaned our clock in the Deep South. No question about it. We got murdered there. That is the most conservative part of this great country. Thats the fact.But you know what? Were out of the Deep South now. And were moving up. We got here. Were going to California. We got a number of large states there. And having won seven out of the last eight caucuses and primaries, having a level of excitement and energy among working people and low-income people doing better against Donald Trump and the other Republicans in poll after poll than Secretary Clinton is, yeah, I believe that were going to win this nomination, and I believe were going to obliterate Donald Trump or whoever the Republican candidate is.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: Now, let me say this...BLITZER: Secretary Clinton, go ahead.CLINTON: I think its  I think its important for people out there watching this tonight to know that I also have a considerable lead in pledged delegates. And my lead in pledged delegates is actually wider than Barack Obamas lead was over me.And in addition to winning states in the Deep South, we won Florida, Texas, Arizona, Massachusetts, Ohio, Illinois, North Carolina, Missouri.(APPLAUSE)And so I think where we stand today is that we are in this campaign very confident and optimistic, but it all comes down to reaching every single voter. Im not taking anything for granted or any voter or any place.So Im going to work my heart out here in New York until the polls close on Tuesday. Im going to work in Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Delaware and Maryland, all the way through California. And when we end up with the number of delegates we need, we will unite the party and have a unified convention...BLITZER: Senator, go ahead. CLINTON: ... that well go onto the general election with.SANDERS: The reason  the reason why in virtually every contest we are winning by very strong margins younger people  and Im not just talking about very young. You know, the older you get, the younger young gets  45 or younger  is I think people are sensing that establishment politics and dependence on Wall Street and big money interest is really never going to address the crises that we face.(APPLAUSE)And people understand, you cant take money from powerful special interests into your PAC and then really expect the American people to believe youre going to stand up to these powerful special interests. So I am very proud of the fact that we have brought millions of new people into the political process...BLITZER: Thank you, Senator.SANDERS: ... many of whom previously had given up.BLITZER: Thank you, Senator, very much. The candidates, they will make their final pitches to New York voters right after this.(APPLAUSE)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BLITZER: Welcome back to the CNN presidential debate. Its time for the candidates closing statements. Each candidate will have two minutes. Senator Sanders, youre first.SANDERS: I grew up in Brooklyn, New York...(APPLAUSE)... the son of an immigrant who came to this country from Poland at the age of 17 without a nickel in his pocket, never made a whole lot of money, but was a very proud American, because this country gave him and my mom the opportunity to send their kids to college.I believe that this country has enormous potential if we have the guts to take on the big money interests who dominate our economic and political life. And I disagree with Secretary Clinton in the belief that you can get money from Wall Street, that you can get money for a super PAC from powerful special interests, and then at the end of the day do what has to be done for the working families of this country. I just dont accept that.What I believe is that this country, if we stand together and not let the Trumps of the world divide us up, can guarantee health care to all people as a right, can have paid family and medical leave, can make public colleges and universities tuition-free, can lead the world in transforming our energy system and combatting climate change, can break up the large financial institutions, can demand that the wealthiest people in this country start paying their fair share of taxes.And we can do that when millions of people stand up, fight back, and create a government that works for all of us, not just the 1 percent.(APPLAUSE)That is what the political revolution is about. That is what this campaign is about. And with your help, were going to win here in New York. Thank you. Thank you.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Secretary Clinton? Secretary Clinton?CLINTON: Thank you. I am very grateful for the fact that the people of New York gave me the great honor of serving as your senator. You took a chance on me in 2000, and then you re-elected me with one of the biggest margins weve had in our state in 2006. During those years, we worked closely together. I tried to have your back, and time and time again, you had mine.We took on the challenges of 9/11 together. We got the money to rebuild New York. We came to the aid of our brave first responders, construction workers, and others who endangered their own health by helping to save lives and search for survivors.(APPLAUSE)We worked to create jobs  despite the disastrous policies of George W. Bush  across New York. And we stood up time and time again against all kinds of vested powerful interests.Im asking for your support again in the primary on Tuesday to continue that work together, to take what we did in New York and to take those New York values to the White House, and put them to work on behalf of all of our people, to knock down the barriers that stand in the way.You know, of course we have economic barriers. Ive been fighting against those trying to even the odds most of my adult life. But we also have racial barriers, gender barriers, homophobic barriers, disability barriers.(APPLAUSE)We have a lot of barriers that stand in the way of people being treated as they should and having the chance to live up to their own God-given potential.So I am humbly asking for your support on Tuesday.

28,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/19/us/politics/driven-by-campaign-populism-democrats-unite-on-expanding-social-security.html,6/19/16,"WASHINGTON  President Obama, Hillary Clinton and other Democrats are rallying around proposals to expand Social Security and increase benefits, a sea change after three decades dominated by concern over the programs rising costs.The Democrats new consensus was driven by the populist election-year politics of Senator Bernie Sanders and by a realization that many workers have neither traditional pensions nor any significant retirement savings.Mr. Sanders campaigned hard on promises to expand Social Security. Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, helped set the tone as well, breaking with Republican orthodoxy by vowing not to cut Social Security benefits. That position puts him potentially at odds with Republican lawmakers eager to rein in entitlement programs, though an aide has suggested that he might be flexible on the issue.The Democrats proposals would amount to the biggest changes in Social Security since 1983, when the program faced a financial crisis and Congress enacted measures recommended by a bipartisan commission headed by Alan Greenspan. To save the program, spending was trimmed, taxes were raised and the eligibility age was set to increase slowly as the population ages.Since then, many Republicans and some Democrats have expressed concern about the growing cost of entitlement programs, including those for retiring baby boomers, and have discussed proposals to trim Social Security further.Social Security is going broke, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan has declared.In budget negotiations in 2011 and 2012, Mr. Obama seriously considered proposals to curtail future Social Security benefits by changing the way cost-of-living increases were calculated. He included a similar proposal in his budget request in early 2013, in an unsuccessful effort to achieve a bipartisan agreement on deficit reduction.The calculations that drove those efforts have not changed. In their last report, in July 2015, the trustees of Social Security, including four administration officials, said the programs old-age and disability insurance trust funds could be depleted in 2034, and could then pay just 79 percent of promised benefits unless Congress took action.But the politics have shifted. Mr. Obama summarized the new Democratic consensus in a speech in Elkhart, Ind., on June 1.Its time we finally made Social Security more generous, and increased its benefits so that todays retirees and future generations get the dignified retirement that theyve earned, Mr. Obama said. And we could start paying for it by asking the wealthiest Americans to contribute a little bit more.Democrats appear likely to include those proposals in their platform. Senator Sanders, working with other progressives, has transformed the debate, so that expanding Social Security is today a central and consensus tenet of the Democratic Party, Nancy J. Altman, the president of Social Security Works, an advocacy group, said at a hearing of the platform-drafting committee on June 9.Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas and chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said the Democrats stance was not a surprise. Whenever theres a problem with a federal program, Mr. Brady said, the presidents answer is to raise taxes and throw more money at it.Mr. Sanders has long pushed for the expansion of Social Security and made that a major theme of his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. The partys new consensus gave Mr. Sanders reason to crow.A few years ago we were told that the debate on Social Security was not whether we were going to cut it, but by how much, said Warren Gunnels, the policy director for the Sanders campaign. Many of us stood up and fought back.Now, he said, after Mr. Obamas remarks this month in Indiana, we are all unified as Democrats, and the issue is not whether were going to expand Social Security, but how much were going to expand it.Sixty million people receive Social Security benefits totaling more than $74 billion each month. So even small changes can have big implications.At one point, just before the New Hampshire primary in February, Mr. Sanders challenged Mrs. Clintons record on Social Security and suggested that she might support increasing the age at which people become eligible for full retirement benefits. (That age, originally set at 65, increases gradually and is already scheduled to reach 67 for people born after 1959.)Responding immediately on Twitter, Mrs. Clinton denounced the comments as false innuendos and promised: I wont cut Social Security. As always, Ill defend it, & Ill expand it.Specifically, Mrs. Clinton says, she would increase benefits for widows and those who take time out of the paid work force to care for a child or a sick family member. She would require the wealthiest Americans to contribute more through higher taxes. And she says she would fight efforts to privatize Social Security, reduce annual cost-of-living adjustments or increase the age for collecting full retirement benefits.Mr. Obama highlighted other reasons for the Democrats renewed focus on Social Security. A lot of Americans dont have retirement savings, he said, and fewer people have pensions they can really count on.More than 110 House Democrats  out of 188 total  have endorsed a resolution supporting policies to protect and expand Social Security.Democrats have offered a number of proposals to alter the formula for calculating Social Security benefits or financing the program, but have not endorsed a specific legislative package. One proposal would increase benefits for everyone, with extra help for those considered most vulnerable. Another would increase the cost-of-living adjustment to reflect the fact that older Americans tend to use more health care services. Another proposal would impose payroll taxes on workers earnings above $250,000 a year.In the Senate, Democrats are digging in against a Republican nominated by Mr. Obama to serve a second term as a public trustee of Social Security, a watchdog over the finances of the program. Democrats say the nominee, Charles P. Blahous III, who served as a trustee from 2010 to 2015, has undermined public confidence in the program by exaggerating its financial problems. He was an architect of President George W. Bushs failed plan to let people put some of their payroll taxes into personal retirement accounts.Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, described Mr. Blahous as an anti-government zealot. Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, said, Mr. Blahous has shown over the course of his academic career that he is personally ideologically opposed to the fundamental promise of Social Security.Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah and chairman of the Finance Committee, dismissed the criticism of Mr. Blahous as partisan rants meant to whip up support and help raise money for Democrats in an election year.This firestorm is about politics, pure and simple, Mr. Hatch said.By a vote of 14 to 12 on June 8, the Finance Committee recommended the confirmation of Mr. Blahous, over the objections of all Democrats on the panel.The trustees supervise the preparation of a detailed annual report on the financial outlook for Social Security and Medicare. The reports are trusted and frequently cited by members of both parties, including Mr. Ryan, who has called the explosion of entitlement spending the greatest threat to our nations long-term economic prosperity.Mr. Trump may have opened a fissure in his party, just as Democrats unite. He assured Iowa voters in December that were not going to cut your Social Security, and at a Republican debate in March, he said, I will do everything within my power not to touch Social Security, to leave it the way it is.But in his 2000 book, The America We Deserve, Mr. Trump referred to Social Security as a huge Ponzi scheme, suggested raising the age for full benefits to 70 and said, Privatization would be good for all of us.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
29,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/04/nyregion/last-atlantic-city-casino-linked-to-trump-is-closing-amid-a-strike.html,8/4/16,"The last of the Atlantic City casinos once operated by Donald J. Trump is set to close early next month.The Trump Taj Mahal, which has been picketed since July 1 by hundreds of striking employees, will shut its doors for good after Labor Day, the casinos management announced on Wednesday. The Taj, which Mr. Trump heralded as the eighth wonder of the world when it opened in 1990, would be the fifth casino in the city to close in less than three years.The company that manages the Taj blamed the striking workers for blocking the casinos path to profitability. But the president of their union, Bob McDevitt of Unite Here Local 54, said the casinos owner, Carl C. Icahn, was willing to burn the Trump Taj Mahal down to punish the strikers.Mr. Icahn acquired the Taj last year after its parent company, Trump Entertainment Resorts, filed for bankruptcy protection. Mr. Trump, who is now the Republican nominee for president, has not had a stake in the Taj since its parent company emerged from the bankruptcy proceedings. Tropicana Entertainment has been managing the Taj, as well as the Tropicana, another of the eight remaining casinos in Atlantic City.Tony Rodio, the chief executive of Tropicana Entertainment, said in a statement that Icahn Enterprises had lost almost $100 million trying to save the Taj. Currently, the Taj is losing multimillions a month, and now with this strike, we see no path to profitability, he said.Mr. Rodio said the company planned to send the casinos employees official notices this week about its intention to close after the Labor Day weekend.In an angry response, Mr. McDevitt said Mr. Icahn had refused to negotiate with the workers, who were demanding health insurance and other benefits similar to what other casinos in Atlantic City have promised the unions members. Local 54 had authorized strikes at five casinos this summer, but the union reached agreements with the others.Two weeks ago, union leaders rejected the latest offer from Mr. Icahn, and about 1,000 Taj workers remained on strike. Before the strike, Mr. Icahn had promised to invest $100 million to renovate the Taj, which has lost much of the luster it had when it was Mr. Trumps crown jewel.For a few million bucks, he could have had labor peace and a content work force, Mr. McDevitt said of Mr. Icahn in a statement, but instead hed rather slam the door shut on these long-term workers just to punish them and attempt to break their strike. In the end, hell have to live with what hes done to working people in Atlantic City.The workers on strike include cooks, bartenders and room cleaners. The Taj has remained open through the strike because its managers and the dealers on the casino floor are not members of Unite Here. All told, a shutdown would eliminate nearly 3,000 jobs.Already, the seaside resort has lost about 8,000 jobs as casinos in neighboring states lured gamblers away. The industrys annual revenue has been cut in half  a drop of more than $2.5 billion  in the past nine years. In 2014, four casinos  the Atlantic Club, Revel, Showboat and Trump Plaza  shut their doors.With the loss of so much tax revenue, the citys government has been struggling to avert its own bankruptcy. In late May, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, a Republican, and legislative leaders in Trenton negotiated a bailout package intended to keep the city afloat for five months while local leaders try to balance the municipal budget. That package included a $74 million loan from the state.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
30,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/12/us/politics/congress-affordable-care-act.html,1/12/17,"WASHINGTON  The House is expected to give final approval on Friday to a measure that would allow Republicans to speedily gut the Affordable Care Act with no threat of a Senate filibuster, a move that would thrust the question of what health law would come next front and center even before President-elect Donald J. Trump takes office.The House vote would come after the Senate narrowly approved the same measure, a budget blueprint, early Thursday morning. Americans woke up Thursday to the realization that a Republican Congress was serious about repealing President Obamas signature domestic achievement  a move that could leave 20 million Americans unsure of their health coverage and millions more wondering if protections offered by the Affordable Care Act could soon be taken away.This is a critical step forward, the first step toward bringing relief from this failed law, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, said.Democrats said the rush to repeal was the height of legislative irresponsibility and would endanger the health of millions.For the life of me, I cant understand the need to take health care away from people, and why in the world anybody would even contemplate doing that without something to replace it, said Representative Louise M. Slaughter of New York. Just snatching it out from under them and its gone. I think that theres going to be a mighty rumble in this country, an outburst of anger and fear.What comes next may be the most pressing problem facing Republicans, who may find that dismantling the health law is far easier than replacing it with one that can unite their fractious members  and win over some Democrats.After a marathon session, the Senate voted 51 to 48 to approve a budget measure that would clear the way for the health care law to be repealed with a simple Senate majority. As the House approached its vote, some Republicans remained reluctant to act without a clear strategy to replace the health law.Wed like to see a little more flesh on the bone before we sign on the dotted line, said Representative Andy Harris of Maryland, an anesthesiologist and a member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus.Republicans skeptical of moving forward risked looking hostile to the repeal effort. And there was a prevailing sense of the importance of following through on a campaign promise upon which so many House Republicans had staked their political reputations.This is an issue that really and truly, in some ways, put two-thirds of our conference here, said Representative Doug Collins of Georgia, a member of the partys leadership team.Everybody wants to get it right, he said.Republican leaders sought to reassure members that the House budget vote  procedurally important as it is  is only the first step in an exhaustive process to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. Four committees in the House and Senate would then be tasked with drafting the legislation that would gut the existing health law.The concerns fostered a remarkable alignment between some centrist Republicans and their counterparts in the House Freedom Caucus, the hard-right group that is disposed to disagree with its own partys leaders.Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin worked to soothe concerns even as he expressed the urgent need to get rid of a law that Republicans hate. Republicans would embark on a thoughtful, step-by-step process, he said, even though the law is collapsing while we speak.Mr. Ryan also said he was working with Mr. Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence. Mr. Trump called this week for a near simultaneous repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act.We are in complete sync, Mr. Ryan said.But Republicans face a significant challenge in passing the necessary legislation to replace the health care law. They can repeal major parts of the existing law without facing a filibuster, but they would not be able put in place a full replacement in the same measure, because arcane budget rules limit what can be included in such a filibuster-proof bill.Instead, they would almost certainly need to pass another bill or multiple bills with 60 Senate votes, and that would require at least some Democratic cooperation.Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, a prime target for Republican wooing, asserted on Thursday that Mr. Trump did not want to repeal Obamacare but repair it. He cited Mr. Trumps stated support for popular provisions like requiring insurers to provide coverage for people with pre-existing medical conditions.Were in a repair mode, Mr. Manchin said. They need 60 votes to repair. Im actually happy to work with them.Republicans in Congress have offered many replacement ideas, but it is not clear whether their most conservative members will ever be able to agree on legislation acceptable to the partys moderates.A manifesto issued by House Republicans in June outlined a consensus proposal, produced by the chairmen of four House committees, including Representative Tom Price of Georgia, chosen by Mr. Trump to be secretary of health and human services.Mr. Trump and congressional leaders said they were counting on Mr. Price to help them write a replacement for the Affordable Care Act, most likely drawing from a bill that he introduced in July 2009 and has reintroduced several times since.I think theres an acknowledgment both by the administration coming in and people around here that his imprint needs to be on this, Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, said.Senate Republicans do not have a detailed plan. But Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, chairman of the health committee, laid out a road map on the Senate floor this week that pointed to a measure potentially more expansive than House plans.The major Republican proposals have not been analyzed by the Congressional Budget Office, so no independent or authoritative estimates exist of their costs or the number of people who might gain or lose coverage.On several points, the major Republican proposals agree.They would eliminate the requirements that most Americans carry health insurance and that larger employers offer it to employees.They would offer tax credits for health insurance and new tax incentives for health savings accounts; provide subsidies for state high-risk pools, to help people who could not otherwise obtain insurance; and make it easier for insurance companies to sell policies across state lines.They would also provide some protection for people with pre-existing conditions who have maintained continuous coverage. They could not be dropped by an insurer and could move from one plan to another, but a person with a pre-existing condition seeking insurance after a lapse of coverage could in some cases be charged higher rates. The protections would be weaker than those in the Affordable Care Act.Republicans also do not agree on how to pay for a replacement plan. In the House document, Republicans proposed limiting the value of tax-free health benefits that employers could provide to employees.Under the current law, employees do not have to pay federal income tax on contributions that employers make to their health insurance. House Republicans said this open-ended subsidy had encouraged people to select more expensive coverage, driving up premiums.But business groups, labor unions and some conservative lawmakers vehemently oppose that change, saying it amounts to a new tax on benefits and on working families. Senate Republicans have also not expressed support for the idea.Many House Republicans, including Mr. Price, would provide tax credits to help people buy insurance. But the amount of assistance would increase with age and would not be tied to income, as it is under the existing health care law.The subsidies would probably be smaller than under the Affordable Care Act. But insurance would be less expensive, Republicans say, because the government would impose fewer requirements.Mr. Alexander said he would allow individuals to use their Obamacare subsidies to purchase state-approved insurance outside the Obamacare exchanges. Under the health care law, such assistance can be used only in the insurance exchanges.Many Republicans say states should have much more power to define essential health benefits.On Medicaid, the federal insurance program for low-income people, House Republicans would roll back the Affordable Care Acts expansion and give each state a fixed amount of money for each beneficiary  or a lump sum of federal money for all of a states Medicaid program.But more than half the states, including some with Republican governors, have expanded Medicaid eligibility under Mr. Obamas law, with large sums of federal money, and pragmatic Republicans are reluctant to snatch away the federal money that has allowed big increases in Medicaid enrollment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
31,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/28/nyregion/neediest-cases-fund-iraqi-family.html,1/28/17,"Maha al-Obaidis family is divided.She immigrated to New York City in 2014, reuniting with her three sons who had arrived earlier. She expected that her husband, Husham al-Qadhi, and her two other sons would soon join her from Amman, Jordan, finally bringing the family together after a tumultuous decade of surviving the Iraq war, fleeing to Jordan and then searching for a permanent home.But on Friday, the family was dealt another blow, after President Trump approved a sweeping executive order on immigration that, among other things, blocked entry into the United States for 90 days for citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries including Iraq, where members of the family are citizens. Her husband and two sons in Jordan are for now locked out of the United States, and Ms. Obaidi cannot travel away, or risk being denied re-entry.Now our family in the U.S. cant even come to visit us, nor can we visit them, Mr. Qadhi said on Saturday in Amman. We just sit and watch like the rest of the world what is happening, and our fate is being decided for us, in front of our eyes.The family lived in Baghdad as American tanks, troops and missiles tore into the Iraqi capital in 2003. It stayed for several years, despite gunfire and bomb blasts outside its house and the kidnapping of several family members. The family helped American soldiers even though other Iraqis targeted it for doing so.One of the sons in Amman, Thabit al-Qadhi, said he and his father had run a snack bar on an American base in Baghdad, serving candy and soft drinks to troops, and operated a 24-hour internet cafe, which required them to be vetted and approved to begin work.After Thabit al-Qadhi was kidnapped in 2006 by Qaeda terrorists and eventually released, he said, he reported details about the episode to American officials in the hope that they would be caught. And on his way home from the Baghdad base one day, he came upon four American troops injured along the road, and he said he had loaded them into his car and driven them to the Green Zone.America has abandoned its responsibility to protect those who protected and cooperated with the Americans, he said. Its a decision solely based on my religious faith. Its discrimination solely on religious grounds.He added: This is the wrong decision. Is it even constitutional?The familys home was along one of Baghdads major highways, an entry point for American troops during the invasion. The family huddled in a windowless section of the home for 10 days, as bullets shattered windows and rockets blazed through the sky, until the United States took control of Baghdad.In the years after the invasion, the family remained in Iraq, even as unrest spread, militants took up arms and centuries-old tensions between Sunnis and Shiites flared up.In addition to Thabit al-Qadhi, Ms. Obaidis husband was also kidnapped, on two separate occasions. The family members recalled the lengths to which they went to get them freed, how they stuffed $60,000 in Iraqi dinars into garbage bags and were instructed by cellphone to travel to a series of locations before dropping off the ransom.It was like in the movies, Ms. Obaidi said in an interview this month.Fearing more attacks, the family left Iraq for Jordan. It joined many other Iraqi refugees, including extended family members. Ms. Obaidi and her husband used their savings to buy a home in Amman. Employment opportunities were scarce for Iraqis, leading three of her sons, starting in 2010, to venture to the United States to find work.When Ms. Obaidi later followed them, she hoped that her entire family could apply for asylum and unite in America. She made the trip despite a number of concerns.At first, I felt afraid, she said. How can I live in this country? It is a foreign country. It is very far from my culture. How will I be compatible with the community?To her surprise, Ms. Obaidi found New York to be unlike its gruff stereotypes. People smiled as she walked down the street. Men helped her haul heavy bags up stairs. Others offered her seats on the subway.Everybody in America is very nice, she said. They are very polite, helpful people, nice people, always with a smile on their face. That is my experience.She has found additional support from the International Rescue Committee, a global humanitarian aid, relief and development nongovernmental organization based in New York. Founded in 1933, the organization is the newest organization supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, and the only one of the eight groups whose work extends beyond the New York area. It operates in 29 cities in the United States and in more than 40 countries.The organization was instrumental in helping Ms. Obaidi adjust to her new life and connecting her with a number of social services, including health insurance and food stamps. It helped her obtain a Social Security card, navigate New Yorks streets and understand its transportation system. The group also helped her study for her drivers license permit exam, among other services.I feel I am not lonely, she said. I have somebody. I have somebody to support me.She shares a home in the Astoria neighborhood in Queens with two of her sons, Saif al-Qadhi and Qaed al-Qadhi. Her third son, Tameem al-Kadhi, and his wife, Melissa Forstrom, also live in the neighborhood.I have a nice life, Ms. Obaidi said. Even though my apartment is small, I feel happy in it. I like it.But it is a home with some notable, painful absences. Ive divided myself, Ms. Obaidi said. Some part is there in Jordan, and some parts _ She trailed off, overcome with emotion.In Amman, Thabit al-Qadhi, her oldest son, lives with his wife and 5-year-old son across the street from Ms. Obaidis husband, Husham, and their youngest son, Omar al-Qadhi. They have been denied asylum in the United States.In October 2015, Husham al-Qadhi was sent a conditional acceptance letter for asylum in the United States. About a year later, he received a second letter, denying him resettlement. Omar al-Qadhi, who works at Unicef to help provide water, sanitation and hygiene to Syrian refugees in Jordan, was also denied resettlement.We have lived here as if we were waiting for something, as if everything was temporary, but now we no longer know what we are waiting for, Omar al-Qadhi said in his apartment in Amman.Thabit al-Qadhi, who has traveled to New York several times to visit his family, has not received the same denial letters for resettlement in the United States. His tourist visa was renewed, but a week later, an officer at the American Embassy in Amman told him that his visa had been canceled, and his case for resettlement was denied.Whether they will ever get approval to move to the United States is even more uncertain now. Thabit al-Qadhi said that Mr. Trumps order was particularly painful and that he felt America was turning its back on Iraqis who had risked their lives to help soldiers during the war.At the end we realized we were no longer welcome, neither from the Iraqis because we worked with the Americans, nor from the Americans because we were Iraqi, he said.Like many Iraqis, Thabit al-Qadhi is living in Jordan on a conditional basis. He must renew his permission every year, and it is dependent on the familys financial means.Nothing is guaranteed in business, he said. Today, my trade company here is successful, but if one day the business fails, then what will happen? Where do I go?In the United States, his siblings, even with employment and legal immigration status, live in a similar state of unsteadiness and concern.For three years, Tameem al-Kadhis only proof of his legal status was an arrival-departure record known as an I-94 form, a document without a photo of him and only his name and identification numbers. It has hindered his attempts to travel even within the United States. Visas for Saif al-Qadhis wife and children were approved recently after a wait of more than two years. They were booked on a plane expected to arrive Feb. 7, but Fridays executive order by Mr. Trump has dashed those plans.The kids, they grow up far from their father, Saif al-Qadhi said. All of a sudden, I told them Im sorry, something changed. I may not be able to see you soon.He and his wife are distraught by the development, which leaves them in a precarious position. In anticipation of the move, their children were taken out of their private school and the lease on their apartment in Amman is to expire on Feb. 1.Im watching the news every second, Mr. Qadhi said.Ms. Obaidis children have been able to acclimate to their new surroundings and establish a rhythm in their lives. Tameem al-Kadhi owns a cellphone store in the East Village in Manhattan, Qaed al-Qadhi works as an information technology manager, and Saif al-Qadhi is an Uber driver. Ms. Obaidi stays busy by volunteering at the Masjid Dar Al-Dawah mosque.The family gathers as often as work schedules and other responsibilities allow, most often on Sundays, when Ms. Obaidi prepares a large meal. They all await the day when more chairs can be placed around the table.Halfway across the world, the other half of the family shares that sentiment.

32,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/28/us/politics/congress-republicans-democrats.html,2/28/17,"WASHINGTON  Congressional Republicans, racked by divisions over health care, taxes and spending, are increasingly desperate for leadership from the White House to unite the party and point the way toward consensus.But presidential leadership does not appear to be forthcoming, leaving the party largely paralyzed at a moment it had thought would be full of legislative activity.The White House is huge, said Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota. The president is the only person who can sign a bill into law, so hes the guy that ultimately holds the whip hand when it comes to this getting done.As congressional leaders struggle to clear the first major legislative hurdle of the Trump era  a bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act  their talks with the White House, though not infrequent, have failed to advance any coherent, cohesive policy prescription. Repealing the health care law is the Republicans first step toward enacting their broader agenda.So far, President Trump, seeking to project an image of a man of action, has preferred attention-grabbing executive actions over closed-door engagement with Congress.In the absence of presidential leadership, the most fiscally conservative House Republicans have stepped forward to demand that the health care law be whittled to near nothingness. More moderate senators are insisting on a replacement plan with many of the current laws popular components.Both sides are pressing hard to sway lawmakers working on draft legislation that would roll back the Affordable Care Acts expansion of Medicaid, replace the subsidies offered in the insurance marketplaces with tax credits to buy coverage, and eliminate tax penalties for people who do not have health insurance.After weeks of loud protests across the country from voters who are fearful of losing their health care, Republican governors complicated matters further this week by joining Democrats in a call for a replacement plan that would ensure coverage for the 20 million Americans who gained insurance under the Affordable Care Act.Id like to hear a renewed commitment to repealing the law, said Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah  another sign of just how far the party is from unity.Democrats, who have been dismissed as obstructionists by Republicans determined to repeal and replace the law without them, are sitting by quietly waiting for those efforts to fail. At that point, Democrats believe, Republicans will have to reach across the aisle and repair the law.Weve maintained all along there is room to negotiate, said Senator Brian Schatz, Democrat of Hawaii. But only if they abandon their attempt to repeal the law.While he has seen no moves toward cooperation yet, they are in a world of hurt, Mr. Schatz said of Republicans, because none of their plans add up, and their members are starting to figure this out and the public is starting to figure this out, and they dont have Obama as a foil anymore. I think they need to fail first.Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri, who has long offered to help fix the law, said she had heard from only one Republican colleague, Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, since the end of last year. I dont think Republicans have decided what theyre waiting for, she said. The White House or Godot.Many Republicans seem to be resigned to seeking consensus on health care legislation, as well as on a budget and tax reform, without comprehensive White House guidance.Representative Michael McCaul, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said he was relying less on a signal from Mr. Trump than on behind-the-scenes discussions between lawmakers and the administration to get the details filled in.Those details include how Mr. Trump plans to fund his call for a 10 percent increase in military spending, Mr. McCaul said. From a budget standpoint, these numbers are difficult to crunch, he said. We as Republicans want a stronger national defense. That moneys got to come from someplace. Thats where the hard decisions have to be made.Mr. Trumps aversion to making big changes to two of the costliest government programs, Medicare and Social Security  something Republicans generally crave  is not helping matters. That makes it even more difficult, Mr. McCaul said.The presidents budget outline, unveiled this week, has something for almost every Republican to hate, from the lack of so-called entitlement reform to large proposed cuts at the State Department.Speaking for myself, said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, I think the diplomatic portion of the federal budget is very important, and you get results a lot cheaper, frequently, than you do on the defense side. So, speaking for myself, Im not in favor of huge reductions at the State Department.Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, called those cuts dead in the water for him.Many of Mr. Trumps direct contributions to the legislative process have happened through the news media, as he has signaled his priorities in interviews that have sometimes left congressional Republicans scrambling to decipher his intentions.Representative Eric Swalwell, Democrat of California, said some of his Republican colleagues were frustrated by their inability to move forward. Theyre reading about what he wants to do at the same time I am in the paper, he said.Six weeks after Mr. Trump said Republicans would provide a replacement plan for the Affordable Care Act that offered insurance for everybody, Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin is fighting to reconcile his partys competing priorities while also contending with the occasional messaging complication from the White House.This is a plan that we are all working on together: the House, the Senate, the White House, Mr. Ryan said Tuesday. Were all working on this together with the administration.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
33,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/28/us/politics/trump-congress-video-transcript.html,2/28/17,"President Trump on Tuesday delivered his first address to a joint session of Congress. The following is a transcript, as prepared by the Federal News Service. For more coverage, read our live analysis.TRUMP: Thank you very much. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of Congress, the first lady of the United States ...(APPLAUSE)... and citizens of America, tonight, as we mark the conclusion of our celebration of Black History Month, we are reminded of our nations path toward civil rights and the work that still remains to be done.Recent threats ...(APPLAUSE)Recent threats targeting Jewish community centers and vandalism of Jewish cemeteries, as well as last weeks shooting in Kansas City, remind us that while we may be a nation divided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all of its very ugly forms.(APPLAUSE)Each American generation passes the torch of truth, liberty and justice, in an unbroken chain all the way down to the present. That torch is now in our hands. And we will use it to light up the world.I am here tonight to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is a message deeply delivered from my heart. A new chapter ...(APPLAUSE)... of American greatness is now beginning. A new national pride is sweeping across our nation. And a new surge of optimism is placing impossible dreams firmly within our grasp. What we are witnessing today is the renewal of the American spirit. Our allies will find that America is once again ready to lead.(APPLAUSE)All the nations of the world  friend or foe  will find that America is strong, America is proud, and America is free. In nine years, the United States will celebrate the 250th anniversary of our founding, 250 years since the day we declared our independence. It will be one of the great milestones in the history of the world.But what will America look like as we reach our 250th year? What kind of country will we leave for our children? I will not allow the mistakes of recent decades past to define the course of our future.For too long, weve watched our middle class shrink as weve exported our jobs and wealth to foreign countries. Weve financed and built one global project after another, but ignored the fates of our children in the inner cities of Chicago, Baltimore, Detroit and so many other places throughout our land.Weve defended the borders of other nations while leaving our own borders wide open for anyone to cross [Fact check: Open in parts, but heavily patrolled as well.], and for drugs to pour in at a now unprecedented rate. And weve spent trillions and trillions of dollars overseas, while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled.Then, in 2016, the earth shifted beneath our feet. The rebellion started as a quiet protest, spoken by families of all colors and creeds, families who just wanted a fair shot for their children, and a fair hearing for their concerns.But then the quiet voices became a loud chorus, as thousands of citizens now spoke out together, from cities small and large, all across our country.Finally, the chorus became an earthquake, and the people turned out by the tens of millions, and they were all united by one very simple, but crucial demand, that America must put its own citizens first, because only then can we truly make America great again.(APPLAUSE)Dying industries will come roaring back to life. Heroic veterans will get the care they so desperately need. Our military will be given the resources its brave warriors so richly deserve.Crumbling infrastructure will be replaced with new roads, bridges, tunnels, airports and railways, gleaming across our very, very beautiful land. Our terrible drug epidemic will slow down and ultimately stop. And our neglected inner cities will see a rebirth of hope, safety and opportunity.Above all else, we will keep our promises to the American people.(APPLAUSE)Thank you. Its been a little over a month since my inauguration, and I want to take this moment to update the nation on the progress Ive made in keeping those promises. Since my election, Ford, Fiat-Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Softbank, Lockheed, Intel, Walmart and many others have announced that they will invest billions and billions of dollars in the United States and will create tens of thousands of new American jobs.(APPLAUSE)The stock market has gained almost $3 trillion in value since the election on Nov. 8, a record. Weve saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars by bringing down the price of fantastic  and it is a fantastic  new F-35 jet fighter, and well be saving billions more on contracts all across our government.We have placed a hiring freeze on nonmilitary and nonessential federal workers.We have begun to drain the swamp of government corruption by imposing a five-year ban on lobbying by executive branch officials  and a lifetime ban ...(APPLAUSE)Thank you. Thank you. And a lifetime ban on becoming lobbyists for a foreign government. We have undertaken a historic effort to massively reduce job-crushing regulations, creating a deregulation task force inside of every government agency ...(APPLAUSE)... and were imposing a new rule which mandates that for every one new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated.(APPLAUSE)Were going to stop the regulations that threaten the future and livelihood of our great coal miners. [Fact check: This is partly true but misleading.](APPLAUSE)We have cleared the way for the construction of the Keystone and Dakota Access Pipelines ...(APPLAUSE)... thereby creating tens of thousands of jobs. [Fact check: This needs context.] And Ive issued a new directive that new American pipelines be made with American steel.(APPLAUSE)We have withdrawn the United States from the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership.(APPLAUSE)And with the help of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, we have formed a council with our neighbors in Canada to help ensure that women entrepreneurs have access to the networks, markets and capital they need to start a business and live out their financial dreams.(APPLAUSE)To protect our citizens, I have directed the Department of Justice to form a task force on reducing violent crime. I have further ordered the Departments of Homeland Security and Justice, along with the Department of State and the director of national intelligence, to coordinate an aggressive strategy to dismantle the criminal cartels that have spread all across our nation. [Fact check: True, but they dont do much.](APPLAUSE)We will stop the drugs from pouring into our country and poisoning our youth, and we will expand treatment for those who have become so badly addicted.(APPLAUSE)At the same time, my administration has answered the pleas of the American people for immigration enforcement and border security.(APPLAUSE)By finally enforcing our immigration laws, we will raise wages [Fact check: Maybe a little.], help the unemployed, save billions and billions of dollars, and make our communities safer for everyone.(APPLAUSE)We want all Americans to succeed, but that cant happen in an environment of lawless chaos.We must restore integrity and the rule of law at our borders.(APPLAUSE)For that reason, we will soon begin the construction of a great, great wall along our southern border.(APPLAUSE)As we speak tonight, we are removing gang members, drug dealers and criminals that threaten our communities and prey on our very innocent citizens. [Fact check: Not a big change.] Bad ones are going out as I speak, and as I promised throughout the campaign. To any in Congress who do not believe we should enforce our laws, I would ask you this one question: What would you say to the American family that loses their jobs, their income or their loved one because America refused to uphold its laws and defend its borders?(APPLAUSE)Our obligation is to serve, protect and defend the citizens of the United States. We are also taking strong measures to protect our nation from radical Islamic terrorism.(APPLAUSE)According to data provided by the Department of Justice, the vast majority of individuals convicted of terrorism and terrorism-related offenses since 9/11 came here from outside of our country. We have seen the attacks at home, from Boston to San Bernardino to the Pentagon and, yes, even the World Trade Center. We have seen the attacks in France, in Belgium, in Germany and all over the world.It is not compassionate, but reckless to allow uncontrolled entry from places where proper vetting cannot occur.(APPLAUSE)Those given the high honor of admission to the United States should support this country and love its people and its values. We cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form inside America, and we cannot allow our nation to become a sanctuary for extremists.(APPLAUSE) That is why my administration has been working on improved vetting procedures, and we will shortly take new steps to keep our nation safe, and to keep those out who will do us harm.(APPLAUSE)As promised, I directed the Department of Defense to develop a plan to demolish and destroy ISIS, a network of lawless savages that have slaughtered Muslims and Christians, and men, women and children of all faiths and all beliefs. We will work with our allies, including our friends and allies in the Muslim world, to extinguish this vile enemy from our planet.(APPLAUSE)I have also imposed new sanctions on entities and individuals who support Irans ballistic missile program, and reaffirmed our unbreakable alliance with the state of Israel.(APPLAUSE)Finally, I have kept my promise to appoint a justice to the United States Supreme Court, from my list of 20 judges, who will defend our Constitution.(APPLAUSE)I am greatly honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the gallery tonight.(APPLAUSE)Thank you, Maureen. Her late, great husband, Antonin Scalia, will forever be a symbol of American justice.To fill his seat, we have chosen Judge Neil Gorsuch, a man of incredible skill and deep devotion to the law. He was confirmed unanimously by the Court of Appeals, and I am asking the Senate to swiftly approve his nomination.(APPLAUSE)Tonight, as I outline the next steps we must take as a country, we must honestly acknowledge the circumstances we inherited. Ninety-four million Americans are out of the labor force. [Fact check: This is misleading.] Over 43 million people are now living in poverty. [Fact check: True  but the number has also fallen.] And over 43 million Americans are on food stamps. [Fact check: The number is correct.]More than one in five people in their prime working years are not working. We have the worst financial recovery in 65 years. In the last eight years, the past administration has put on more new debt than nearly all of the other presidents combined.Weve lost more than one-fourth of our manufacturing jobs since Nafta was approved [Fact check: Not because of Nafta.], and weve lost 60,000 factories since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001. Our trade deficit in goods with the world last year was nearly $800 billion. And overseas, we have inherited a series of tragic foreign policy disasters.Solving these and so many other pressing problems will require us to work past the differences of party. It will require us to tap into the American spirit that has overcome every challenge throughout our long and storied history. But to accomplish our goals at home and abroad, we must restart the engine of the American economy, making it easier for companies to do business in the United States and much, much harder for companies to leave our country.(APPLAUSE)Right now, American companies are taxed at one of the highest rates anywhere in the world. My economic team is developing historic tax reform that will reduce the tax rate on our companies so they can compete and thrive anywhere and with anyone.(APPLAUSE)It will be a big, big cut.At the same time, we will provide massive tax relief for the middle class. We must create a level playing field for American companies and our workers  have to do it.(APPLAUSE)Currently, when we ship products out of America, many other countries make us pay very high tariffs and taxes, but when foreign companies ship their products into America, we charge them nothing or almost nothing.I just met with officials and workers from a great American company, Harley-Davidson. In fact, they proudly displayed five of their magnificent motorcycles, made in the U.S.A., on the front lawn of the White House.(APPLAUSE)And they wanted me to ride one, and I said, No, thank you.(LAUGHTER)At our meeting, I asked them, How are you doing? How is business? They said that its good. I asked them further, How are you doing with other countries, mainly international sales?They told me  without even complaining, because they have been so mistreated for so long that theyve become used to it  that its very hard to do business with other countries, because they tax our goods at such a high rate. They said that in the case of another country, they taxed their motorcycles at 100 percent.They werent even asking for a change. But I am. I believe ...(APPLAUSE)I believe strongly in free trade, but it also has to be fair trade. Its been a long time since we had fair trade.The first Republican president, Abraham Lincoln, warned that the abandonment of the protective policy by the American government will produce want and ruin among our people.Lincoln was right, and its time we heeded his advice and his words.(APPLAUSE)I am not going to let America and its great companies and workers be taken  advantage of us any longer. They have taken advantage of our country no longer.(APPLAUSE)I am going to bring back millions of jobs. Protecting our workers also means reforming our system of legal immigration.(APPLAUSE)The current, outdated system depresses wages for our poorest workers and puts great pressure on taxpayers. Nations around the world, like Canada, Australia and many others, have a merit-based immigration system.(APPLAUSE)Its a basic principle that those seeking to enter a country ought to be able to support themselves financially. Yet in America we do not enforce this rule, straining the very public resources that our poorest citizens rely upon.According to the National Academy of Sciences, our current immigration system costs American taxpayers many billions of dollars a year. [Fact check: This needs context.] Switching away from this current system of lower-skilled immigration, and instead adopting a merit-based system, we will have so many more benefits. It will save countless dollars, raise workers wages and help struggling families, including immigrant families, enter the middle class. And they will do it quickly, and they will be very, very happy, indeed.(APPLAUSE)I believe that real and positive immigration reform is possible, as long as we focus on the following goals: to improve jobs and wages for Americans, to strengthen our nations security and to restore respect for our laws.If we are guided by the well-being of American citizens, then I believe Republicans and Democrats can work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades.(APPLAUSE)Another Republican president, Dwight D. Eisenhower, initiated the last truly great national infrastructure program: the building of the interstate highway system. The time has come for a new program of national rebuilding.(APPLAUSE)America has spent approximately $6 trillion in the Middle East, all the while our infrastructure at home is crumbling.With the $6 trillion, we could have rebuilt our country twice, and maybe even three times, if we had people who had the ability to negotiate.(APPLAUSE)To launch our national rebuilding, I will be asking Congress to approve legislation that produces a $1 trillion investment in infrastructure of the United States, financed through both public and private capital, creating millions of new jobs.(APPLAUSE)This effort will be guided by two core principles: Buy American and hire American.(APPLAUSE)Tonight, I am also calling on this Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare ...(APPLAUSE)... with reforms that expand choice, increase access, lower costs and at the same time provide better health care.(APPLAUSE)Mandating every American to buy government-approved health insurance was never the right solution for our country.(APPLAUSE)The way to make health insurance available to everyone is to lower the cost of health insurance, and that is what we are going to do.(APPLAUSE)Obamacare premiums nationwide have increased by double and triple digits. [Fact check: True, but cherry-picked.] As an example, Arizona went up 116 percent last year alone. Gov. Matt Bevin of Kentucky just said Obamacare is failing in his state, the state of Kentucky, and its unsustainable and collapsing.One third of the counties have only one insurer, and theyre losing them fast, they are losing them so fast. Theyre leaving. And many Americans have no choice at all. Theres no choice left.Remember when you were told that you could keep your doctor and keep your plan? We now know that all of those promises have been totally broken. Obamacare is collapsing [Fact check: This is an exaggeration.], and we must act decisively to protect all Americans.(APPLAUSE)Action is not a choice; it is a necessity. So I am calling on all Democrats and Republicans in Congress to work with us to save Americans from this imploding Obamacare disaster.(APPLAUSE)Here are the principles that should guide Congress as we move to create a better health care system for all Americans.First, we should ensure that Americans with pre-existing conditions have access to coverage and that we have a stable transition for Americans currently enrolled in the health care exchanges.(APPLAUSE)Secondly, we should help Americans purchase their own coverage, through the use of tax credits and expanded health savings accounts, but it must be the plan they want, not the plan forced on them by our government.(APPLAUSE)Thirdly, we should give our state governors the resources and flexibility they need with Medicaid to make sure no one is left out.(APPLAUSE)Fourth, we should implement legal reforms that protect patients and doctors from unnecessary costs that drive up the price of insurance and work to bring down the artificially high price of drugs and bring them down immediately.(APPLAUSE)And finally, the time has come to give Americans the freedom to purchase health insurance across state lines ...(APPLAUSE)... which will create a truly competitive national marketplace that will bring costs way down and provide far better care. So important.Everything that is broken in our country can be fixed. Every problem can be solved. And every hurting family can find healing and hope. Our citizens deserve this, and so much more, so why not join forces and finally get the job done and get it done right?(APPLAUSE)On this and so many other things, Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite for the good of our country and for the good of the American people.(APPLAUSE)My administration wants to work with members of both parties to make child care accessible and affordable, to help ensure new parents that they have paid family leave ...(APPLAUSE)... to invest in womens health, and to promote clean air and clean water, and to rebuild our military and our infrastructure.(APPLAUSE)True love for our people requires us to find common ground, to advance the common good, and to cooperate on behalf of every American child who deserves a much brighter future.An incredible young woman is with us this evening who should serve as an inspiration to us all. Today is Rare Disease Day, and joining us in the gallery is a rare disease survivor, Megan Crowley. Megan ...(APPLAUSE)Megan was diagnosed with Pompe disease, a rare and serious illness, when she was 15 months old. She was not expected to live past 5. On receiving this news, Megans dad, John, fought with everything he had to save the life of his precious child. He founded a company to look for a cure and helped develop the drug that saved Megans life. Today she is 20 years old and a sophomore at Notre Dame.(APPLAUSE)Megans story is about the unbounded power of a fathers love for a daughter. But our slow and burdensome approval process at the Food and Drug Administration keeps too many advances, like the one that saved Megans life, from reaching those in need.If we slash the restraints, not just at the F.D.A. but across our government, then we will be blessed with far more miracles just like Megan.(APPLAUSE)In fact, our children will grow up in a nation of miracles. But to achieve this future, we must enrich the mind  and the souls  of every American child. Education is the civil rights issue of our time.(APPLAUSE)I am calling upon members of both parties to pass an education bill that funds school choice for disadvantaged youth, including millions of African-American and Latino children.(APPLAUSE)These families should be free to choose the public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home school that is right for them.(APPLAUSE)Joining us tonight in the gallery is a remarkable woman, Denisha Merriweather. As a young girl, Denisha struggled in school and failed third grade twice. But then she was able to enroll in a private center for learning  great learning center  with the help of a tax credit and a scholarship program. Today, she is the first in her family to graduate, not just from high school, but from college. Later this year, she will get her masters degree in social work. We want all children to be able to break the cycle of poverty just like Denisha.(APPLAUSE)But to break the cycle of poverty, we must also break the cycle of violence. The murder rate in 2015 experienced its largest single-year increase in nearly half a century. [Fact check: True, but somewhat misleading.] In Chicago, more than 4,000 people were shot last year alone, and the murder rate so far this year has been even higher. This is not acceptable in our society.(APPLAUSE)Every American child should be able to grow up in a safe community, to attend a great school and to have access to a high-paying job.(APPLAUSE)But to create this future, we must work with  not against  not against  the men and women of law enforcement.(APPLAUSE)We must build bridges of cooperation and trust, not drive the wedge of disunity and its  really, its what it is, division. Its pure, unadulterated division. We have to unify. Police and sheriffs are members of our community. Theyre friends and neighbors, theyre mothers and fathers, sons and daughters, and they leave behind loved ones every day who worry about whether or not theyll come home safe and sound. We must support the incredible men and women of law enforcement.(APPLAUSE)And we must support the victims of crime. I have ordered the Department of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American victims. The office is called Voice, Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement.We are providing a voice to those who have been ignored by our media [Fact check: They have received coverage.] and silenced by special interests. Joining us ...(APPLAUSE)Joining us in the audience tonight are four very brave Americans whose government failed them. Their names are Jamiel Shaw, Susan Oliver, Jenna Oliver and Jessica Davis. Jamiels 17-year-old son was viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member who had just been released from prison. Jamiel Shaw Jr. was an incredible young man with unlimited potential who was getting ready to go to college, where he would have excelled as a great college quarterback.But he never got the chance. His father, who is in the audience tonight, has become a very good friend of mine. Jamiel, thank you. Thank you.(APPLAUSE)Also with us are Susan Oliver and Jessica Davis. Their husbands  Deputy Sheriff Danny Oliver and Detective Michael Davis  were slain in the line of duty in California. They were pillars of their community. These brave men were viciously gunned down by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record and two prior deportations. Should have never been in our country.Sitting with Susan is her daughter, Jenna. Jenna, I want you to know that your father was a hero and that tonight you have the love of an entire country supporting you and praying for you.(APPLAUSE)To Jamiel, Jenna, Susan and Jessica, I want you to know that we will never stop fighting for justice. Your loved ones will never, ever be forgotten. We will always honor their memory.(APPLAUSE)Finally, to keep America safe, we must provide the men and women of the United States military with the tools they need to prevent war  if they must  they have to fight and they only have to win.(APPLAUSE)I am sending Congress a budget that rebuilds the military, eliminates the defense sequester...(APPLAUSE)... and calls for one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history.My budget will also increase funding for our veterans. Our veterans have delivered for this nation, and now we must deliver for them.(APPLAUSE)The challenges we face as a nation are great. But our people are even greater. And none are greater or braver than those who fight for America in uniform.(APPLAUSE)We are blessed to be joined tonight by Carryn Owens, the widow of U.S. Navy special operator, Senior Chief William Ryan Owens. Ryan died as he lived, a warrior and a hero, battling against terrorism and securing our nation.(APPLAUSE)I just spoke to our great General [Jim] Mattis just now who reconfirmed that, and I quote, Ryan was a part of a highly successful raid that generated large amounts of vital intelligence that will lead to many more victories in the future against our enemy.Ryans legacy is etched into eternity. Thank you.(APPLAUSE)And Ryan is looking down right now. You know that. And hes very happy, because I think he just broke a record.(APPLAUSE)For as the Bible teaches us, there is no greater act of love than to lay down ones life for ones friends. Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his country and for our freedom. And we will never forget Ryan.(APPLAUSE)To those allies who wonder what kind of a friend America will be, look no further than the heroes who wear our uniform. Our foreign policy calls for a direct, robust and meaningful engagement with the world. It is American leadership based on vital security interests that we share with our allies all across the globe.We strongly support NATO, an alliance forged through the bonds of two world wars, that dethroned fascism ...(APPLAUSE)... and a Cold War and defeated communism.(APPLAUSE)But our partners must meet their financial obligations. And now, based on our very strong and frank discussions, they are beginning to do just that. In fact, I can tell you the money is pouring in. Very nice.(APPLAUSE)We expect our partners, whether in NATO, in the Middle East or in the Pacific, to take a direct and meaningful role in both strategic and military operations, and pay their fair share of the cost  have to do that.We will respect historic institutions, but we will respect the foreign rights of all nations. And they have to respect our rights as a nation, also.(APPLAUSE)Free nations are the best vehicle for expressing the will of the people, and America respects the right of all nations to chart their own path. My job is not to represent the world. My job is to represent the United States of America.(APPLAUSE)But we know that America is better off when there is less conflict, not more. We must learn from the mistakes of the past. We have seen the war and the destruction that have ravaged and raged throughout the world. All across the world.The only long-term solution for these humanitarian disasters, in many cases, is to create the conditions where displaced persons can safely return home and begin the long, long process of rebuilding.(APPLAUSE)America is willing to find new friends, and to forge new partnerships, where shared interests align. We want harmony and stability, not war and conflict. We want peace, wherever peace can be found. America is friends today with former enemies. Some of our closest allies, decades ago, fought on the opposite side of these terrible, terrible wars. This history should give us all faith in the possibilities for a better world.Hopefully, the 250th year for America will see a world that is more peaceful, more just, and more free.On our 100th anniversary in 1876, citizens from across our nation came to Philadelphia to celebrate Americas centennial. At that celebration, the countrys builders and artists and inventors showed off their wonderful creations. Alexander Graham Bell displayed his telephone for the first time. Remington unveiled the first typewriter. An early attempt was made at electric light. Thomas Edison showed an automatic telegraph and an electric pen. Imagine the wonders our country could know in Americas 250th year.(APPLAUSE)Think of the marvels we could achieve if we simply set free the dreams of our people. Cures to the illnesses that have always plagued us are not too much to hope. American footprints on distant worlds are not too big a dream. Millions lifted from welfare to work is not too much to expect. And streets where mothers are safe from fear  schools where children learn in peace, and jobs where Americans prosper and grow  are not too much to ask.(APPLAUSE)When we have all of this, we will have made America greater than ever before, for all Americans. This is our vision. This is our mission. But we can only get there together. We are one people, with one destiny.We all bleed the same blood. We all salute the same great American flag. And we are all made by the same God.(APPLAUSE)When we fulfill this vision, when we celebrate our 250 years of glorious freedom, we will look back on tonight as when this new chapter of American greatness began. The time for small thinking is over. The time for trivial fights is behind us. We just need the courage to share the dreams that fill our hearts, the bravery to express the hopes that stir our souls, and the confidence to turn those hopes and those dreams into action.From now on, America will be empowered by our aspirations, not burdened by our fears, inspired by the future, not bound by failures of the past, and guided by a vision, not blinded by our doubts.I am asking all citizens to embrace this renewal of the American spirit. I am asking all members of Congress to join me in dreaming big and bold and daring things for our country. I am asking everyone watching tonight to seize this moment. Believe in yourselves. Believe in your future. And believe, once more, in America.Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
34,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/13/us/politics/seema-verma-medicaid-medicare-administrator.html,3/13/17,"WASHINGTON  The Senate on Monday confirmed Seema Verma, a health policy expert from Indiana, to lead efforts by the Trump administration to transform Medicaid and upend the Affordable Care Act.By a vote of 55 to 43, the Senate approved the nomination of Ms. Verma to be the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which spends more than $1 trillion a year on programs providing health care to more than one-third of all Americans.Unlike most people who have held the job, Ms. Verma has extensive experience in Medicaid, a program that was expanded by President Barack Obamas health care law and now provides coverage to more than 70 million low-income people.Ms. Verma was an architect of Indianas Medicaid program, widely seen as a model by conservatives, and she worked closely with Vice President Mike Pence when he was the states governor. Indiana expanded Medicaid eligibility, but emphasized personal responsibility. That means that beneficiaries pay premiums, contribute to health savings accounts and receive incentives for healthy behavior.Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah and chairman of the Finance Committee, said Ms. Verma was the ideal candidate to oversee the reform of the Medicaid program, as she had worked well with members of both parties in Indiana and in other states.But Senator Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, said she has supported proposals that create roadblocks to coverage for low-income Americans. And she would have a major role in carrying out legislation to gut the Affordable Care Act and remake the Medicaid program, said Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the senior Democrat on the Finance Committee.A plan by House Republicans, which was released last week, would repeal major parts of Mr. Obamas health care law and would phase out the expansion of Medicaid that has brought coverage to millions of people.Senate Democrats cast a wary eye on how Ms. Verma might enforce the legislation, if it is approved. Mr. Wyden said she would be able to give states a green light to push the very frail and sick into high-risk pools in which they could receive substandard coverage or be forced to pay more for the care they need. Senator Maria Cantwell, Democrat of Washington, said Ms. Verma in Indiana made millions of dollars in consulting fees by kicking poor, working people off of Medicaid for failure to pay monthly contributions similar to premiums.And Senator Debbie Stabenow, Democrat of Michigan, said she was dismayed that Ms. Verma had suggested at her confirmation hearing last month that coverage of maternity care should be optional, not required, as it is now under the Affordable Care Act.At that hearing, Ms. Verma said: Some women might want maternity coverage and some women might not want it, might not choose it, might not feel like they need that. So I think its up to women to make the decision that works best for them and their families.But not all Democrats found fault with Ms. Vermas work on Medicaid in Indiana. Under the program she helped devise, hundreds of thousands of Hoosiers currently have health insurance, said Senator Joe Donnelly of Indiana, one of three Democrats who voted for her on Monday.This plan, he said, has helped lower our states uninsured rate and improve health care outcomes, and has played a critical role in combating the opioid-abuse and heroin-use epidemics.The Obama administration granted a waiver for Indianas Medicaid program following lengthy negotiations, and several other states are considering similar changes. Tom Price, the secretary of health and human services, promised last week to give states greater flexibility.Judith Solomon, a vice president at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal-leaning research and advocacy group, said the premiums charged to Medicaid beneficiaries in Indiana, as well as the complexity of the program, appeared to be deterring significant numbers of eligible low-income people from enrolling. Still, she said, the coverage provided under Indianas plan is better than no coverage at all.And without the conservative features of the program, state officials said, Indiana might not have expanded eligibility.Dennis M. Murphy, the chief executive of Indiana University Health, and top executives of five other hospital systems in Indiana endorsed Ms. Verma, saying in a joint statement that she had shown a knack for bipartisan solutions that unite people across the political spectrum.The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has led federal efforts to carry out the Affordable Care Act, setting standards for private health insurance and operating HealthCare.gov, the online marketplace on which more than 10 million people obtained coverage last year.Ms. Verma has comparatively little experience with Medicare, the popular program that insures 57 million people who are 65 or older or have disabilities. Within a decade, enrollment is expected to grow by one-third, to 76 million. As a presidential candidate, Mr. Trump said he did not intend to cut Medicare or Medicaid.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
