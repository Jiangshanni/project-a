To reduce unwanted pregnancies and communicable disease, the Act stipulates that this health insurance cover contraceptive drugs and devices without a copayment by the employee. This provision is objected to by several employers in religiousaffiliated institutions on the grounds that it violates their moral teachings. The proper use of the demand curve permits the Principles of Economics instructor to show that in the standard employer/employee exchange of the value of work for compensation, each side in the exchange pays for what the other side is offering. In the case of the ACA mandate, it is the employee, not the employer, who pays for the contraceptives. This holds true both when the employer contracts with a health insurance company; when the employer selfinsures; and even when the employer does not offer insurance as part of the employee compensation but instead pays the fee required under the ACA."

We examine how well people make these choices, how well they think they do, and what can be done to improve these choices. We conducted 6 experiments asking people to choose the most cost-effective policy using websites modeled on current exchanges. Our results suggest there is significant room for improvement. Without interventions, respondents perform at near chance levels and show a significant bias, overweighting out-of-pocket expenses and deductibles. Financial incentives do not improve performance, and decision-makers do not realize that they are performing poorly. However, performance can be improved quite markedly by providing calculation aids, and by choosing a ""smart"" default. Implementing these psychologically based principles could save purchasers of policies and taxpayers approximately 10 billion dollars every year. © 2013 Johnson et al."

To bridge that gap, all health care professionals working in the field of neurology must reflect on the effect previous Medicare reimbursement policies have had on the current practice of neurology, and utilize lessons learned in recent years.

Reducing 30-day readmissions could save health care resources while improving patient care. Recently, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act authorized reduced Medicare payments to hospitals with excess readmissions for acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, and pneumonia. Starting in October 2014, hospitals will also be penalized for excess COPD readmissions. This retrospective database study investigated whether use of arformoterol, a nebulized long-acting beta agonist, during an inpatient admission, had different 30-day all-cause readmission rates compared with treatment using nebulized short-acting beta agonists (SABAs, albuterol, or levalbuterol). Methods: A US nationally representative hospital database was used to study adults aged ≥40 years, discharged between January, 2006 and March, 2010, and with a diagnosis of COPD. Patients receiving arformoterol on ≥80% of days following treatment initiation were compared with patients receiving a nebulized SABA during hospitalization. Arformoterol and nebulized SABA patients were matched (1:2) for age, sex, severity of inpatient admission, and primary/secondary COPD diagnosis. Logistic regression compared the odds of readmission while adjusting for age, sex, race, admission type, severity, primary/secondary diagnosis, other respiratory medication use, respiratory therapy use, oxygen use, hospital size, and teaching status. Results: This retrospective study compared 812 arformoterol patients and 1,651 nebulized SABA patients who were discharged from their initial COPD hospital admission. An intensive care unit stay was more common among arformoterol patients (32.1% versus 18.4%, P,0.001), suggesting more severe symptoms during the initial admission. The observed readmission rate was significantly lower for arformoterol patients than for nebulized SABA patients (8.7% versus 11.9%, P=0.017), as were the adjusted odds of readmission (odds ratio 0.69, 95% confidence interval 0.51-0.92). Conclusion: All-cause 30-day readmission rates were significantly lower for arformoterol patients than nebulized SABA patients, both before and after adjusting for patient and hospital characteristics. © 2013 Bollu et al.

The health insurance marketplaces will serve as a one-stop resource to help the uninsured and the underinsured find comprehensive health coverage that fits their needs and budget and determine whether they qualify for health insurance tax credits provided by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Physicians may benefit because insured patients are more likely to have a regular source of care, adhere to medical regimens, and access preventive care. However, implementation of the marketplaces may prove challenging if enrollment numbers are insufficient, technical problems arise, and patients are unable to access providers. Despite these potential issues, physicians are encouraged to educate themselves about how the marketplaces work so they can direct their patients to find the coverage that best meets their medical needs. © 2013 American College of Physicians."

It is estimated that with full implementation of the Affordable Care Act in 2014, of the 14.8 million uninsured adults aged 19 to 29, 12.1 million could gain subsidized coverage. Some of the major determinants of health insurance coverage rates for young adults indicate that socioeconomic status (not able to afford the cost of insurance premiums), demographics, perceived value, and perceived need were the most significant determinants of health insurance status of young adults. The aim of the Affordable Care Act is to provide affordable and accessible health care to everyone. This law especially affects the young adult population since this population has often fallen through the cracks with regard to health care coverage. This article details the history and timeline of the law and goes into detail on specific portions of the law, and how it affects young adults specifically. It details portions of the law that have already been put into practice and portions of the law that will be instituted over the next few years.

Programs to expand coverage, however, do not necessarily ensure seamlessness for many individuals who are likelyto experience shifts in program eligibility due to changing circumstances (e.g., income fluctuations, family composition changes, etc.).A number of states are actively working tolimit the impact of changes in program eligibility by developing policies that limit either the incidence of program eligibility changes and/or the impact those changes have on individual consumers.

Consequently, the supply of MH care provider services is expected to proportionately decrease by 18% to 21% in 2014. ACA funding does not demonstrate the ability to increase turnout of psychiatrists sufficiently to meet the need. Available data indicate that the numbers of advanced practice psychiatric nurses (APPNs) continue to increase at a much greater rate, but information from either a clinical perspective or a market perspective is complicated by the weak distinctions that are made between nurse practitioners (NPs) and other nonphysician care professionals. The following recommendations are made: (a) some of the ACA funding for research into efficient and effective care delivery systems should be allocated to acquiring data on APPNs in leadership roles or clinical settings in which they are ultimately responsible for management of MH care, as differentiated from settings in which they provide support for psychiatrists; and (b) since the available data indicate nurse practitioners achieve good outcomes and are more economically viable than psychiatrists, placement of psychiatric-mental health nurse practitioners in community settings should be recognized as a realistic solution to the shortfall of MH services. © The Author(s) 2013."

We studied 6494 Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program (BHCHP) patients to understand the disease burden and health care utilization patterns for a group of insured homeless individuals. Methods. We studied merged BHCHP data and MassHealth eligibility, claims, and encounter data from 2010. MassHealth claims and encounter data provided a comprehensive history of health care utilization and expenditures, as well as associated diagnoses, in both general medical and behavioral health services sectors and across a broad range of health care settings. Results. The burden of disease was high, with the majority of patients experiencing mental illness, substance use disorders, and a number of medical diseases. Hospitalization and emergency room use were frequent and total expenditures were 3.8 times the rate of an average Medicaid recipient. Conclusions. The Affordable Care Act provides a framework for reforming the health care system to improve the coordination of care and outcomes for vulnerable populations. However, improved health care coverage alone may not be enough. Health care must be integrated with other resources to address the complex challenges presented by inadequate housing, hunger, and unsafe environments."

Methods: The basic economic concepts pertinent to health care, including fundamentals of economic theories, gross domestic product (GDP), U.S. revenues and expenditures and the U.S. federal deficit and national debt, are discussed at the outset of this study. This is followed by a review of the U.S. health insurance paradigms and a detailed analysis of the escalating cost of U.S. health care. Finally, the efforts designed to reverse the paradigm of escalating health care costs will be discussed. Results: This study reveals that should the U.S. HC cost continue to escalate at the same rate, HC would consume the entire gross domestic product by 2070. The root causes for this trend are overutilization of HC, inappropriate allocation of HC costs at the end of life, defensive medicine, high-end technology and prescription drugs, failure of competitive market forces, and administrative costs, inefficiency, and waste. The proposed means of reversing this paradigm, including the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, are discussed in light of their economic and social impact. Conclusions: The reversal of the current paradigm of escalating cost of U.S. HC will require extraordinary leadership across the entire spectrum of HC delivery. It is concluded that neither the Affordable Care Act nor the Path to Prosperity will succeed unless the escalating cost of U.S. HC is reversed. It is hoped that this report contributes to that end. © 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

Analyzing these filings for rates taking effect from mid-2012 through mid-2013, insurers attributed the great bulk--three-quarters or more--of these larger rate increases to routine factors such as trends in medical costs. Insurers attributed only a very small portion of these medical cost trends to factors related to the Affordable Care Act. The ACA-related factor mentioned most often, but only in a third of the rate filings in this study, was the requirement to cover women's preventive and contraceptive services without patient cost-sharing. But, the insurers who point to this requirement or other ACA-related costs attributed only about 1 percentage point of their rate increases to the health reform law."

Several aspects of the ACA have important implications for dentists as oral health care professionals and small business employers, as well as consumers of medical care. While much of the effect of the ACA on health care in general and on dentistry in particular remains uncertain at this stage, it is important to highlight some of the potential changes that are likely to occur."

While the states' costs of participating in the Medicaid expansion have been at the forefront of this discussion, the expansion has much larger implications for the flow of federal funds going to the states. This issue brief examines how participating in the Medicaid expansion will affect the movement of federal funds to each state. States that choose to participate in the expansion will experience a more positive net flow of federal funds than will states that choose not to participate. In addition to providing valuable health insurance benefits to low-income state residents, and steady sources of financing to state health care providers, the Medicaid expansion will be an important source of new federal funds for states."

One way this will happen under the provisions of the ACA is by creating a new health insurance marketplace (a health insurance exchange) by 2014 in which ""all people will have a choice for quality, affordable health insurance even if a job loss, job switch, move or illness occurs"". This does not mean that everyone will have whatever insurance coverage he or she wants. The provisions of the ACA require that each of the four benefit categories of plans (known as bronze, silver, gold and platinum) provides no less than the benefits available in an ""essential health benefits package"". However, without a clear understanding of what criteria must be satisfied for health care to be essential, the ACA's requirement is much too vague and open to multiple, potentially conflicting interpretations. Indeed, without such understanding, in the rush to provide health insurance coverage to as many people as is economically feasible, we may replace one kind of disparity (lack of health insurance) with another kind of disparity (lack of adequate health insurance). Thus, this paper explores the concept of ""essential benefits"", arguing that the ""essential health benefits package"" in the ACA should be one that optimally satisfies the basic needs of the people covered. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC."

The percentage of young adults with private health insurance coverage increased from the last 6 months of 2010 through the last 6 months of 2012 (52.0% to 57.9%). Except for an increase in the first 6 months of 2011, the percentage of privately insured young adults who had a gap in coverage during the past 12 months decreased from the first 6 months of 2008 through the last 6 months of 2012 (10.5% to 7.8%). The percentage of privately insured young adults with coverage in their own name decreased from 40.8% in the last 6 months of 2010 to 27.2% in the last 6 months of 2012. The percentage of privately insured young adults with employer-sponsored health insurance increased from the last 6 months of 2010 to the last 6 months of 2012 (85.6% to 92.5%). Young adults often experience instability with regard to work, school, residential status, and financial independence. This could contribute to a lack of or gaps in insurance coverage (1,2). In September 2010, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) extended dependent health coverage to young adults up to age 26. This provision was expected to lead to increases in private coverage for young adults aged 19-25 when they became eligible for coverage through their parents' employment (3,4). This report provides estimates describing the previous insurance status and sources of coverage among privately insured young adults aged 19-25, using data from the 2008-2012 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS).

Meanwhile, six states have already expanded Medicaid since 2010 to some or all of the low-income adults targeted under health reform. We undertook an in-depth exploration of these six ""early-expander"" states-California, Connecticut, the District of Columbia, Minnesota, New Jersey, and Washington-through interviews with high-ranking Medicaid officials. Methods: We conducted semi-structured interviews with 11 high-ranking Medicaid officials in six states and analyzed the interviews using qualitative methods. Interviews explored enrollment outreach, stakeholder involvement, impact on beneficiaries, utilization and costs, implementation challenges, and potential lessons for 2014. Two investigators independently analyzed interview transcripts and iteratively refined the codebook until reaching consensus. Results: We identified several themes. First, these expansions built upon pre-existing state-funded insurance programs for the poor. Second, predictions about costs and enrollment were challenging, indicating the uncertainty in projections for 2014. Other themes included greater than anticipated need for behavioral health services in the expansion population, administrative challenges of expansions, and persistent barriers to enrollment and access after expanding eligibility-though officials overall felt the expansions increased access for beneficiaries. Finally, political context-support or opposition from stakeholders and voters-plays a critical role in shaping the success of Medicaid expansions. Conclusions: Early Medicaid expansions under the ACA offer important lessons to federal and state policymakers as the 2014 expansions approach. While the context of each state's expansion is unique, key shared experiences were significant implementation challenges and opportunities for expanding access to needed services."

This analysis focuses on how state-based and state partnership marketplaces are using their flexibility in setting certification standards to shape plan design in the individual market. It focuses on three aspects of certification: provider networks; inclusion of essential community providers; and benefit substitution, which allows plans to offer benefits that differ from a state's benchmark plan. A review of documents collected from 18 states and the District of Columbia finds that 13 states go beyond the minimum federal requirements with respect to provider network standards, four states specify additional standards for including essential community providers, and five states and Washington, D.C., bar benefit substitution. These interstate variations in plan design reflect the challenges policymakers face in balancing health care affordability, benefit coverage, and access to care through the marketplace plans."

The relationship between type of insurance and access to care for adult patients with acute rotator cuff tears has not yet been examined. This study aimed to determine if type of health insurance would have an impact on access to care for an adult patient with an acute rotator cuff tear. Methods: Seventy-one orthopaedic surgery practices within the state of North Carolina were randomly selected and contacted on 2 different occasions separated by 3 weeks. The practices were presented with an appointment request for a fictitious 42-year-old man with an acute rotator cuff tear. Insurance status was reported as Medicaid for the first call and as private insurance during the second call. Results: Of the 71 practices contacted, 51 (72%) offered the patient with Medicaid an appointment, whereas 68 (96%) offered the patient with private insurance an appointment. The difference in these rates was statistically significant (P < .001). The likelihood of patients with private insurance obtaining an appointment was 8.8 times higher than that of patients with Medicaid (95% CI: 2.5, 31.5).

That argument would have highlighted the role of comprehensive health insurance in steering individuals' healthcare savings and consumption decisions. Because consumer-directed healthcare, which reaches its apex when individuals self-insure, suffers from several known market failures and because comprehensive health insurance policies play an unusually aggressive regulatory role in attempting to correct those failures, the individual mandate could be seen as an attempt to eliminate inefficiencies in the healthcare market that arise from individual decisions to self-insure. This argument would done a better job than the Obama Administration's of aligning the individual mandate with existing Commerce Clause and Necessary and Proper Clause precedent, and it would have done a better job of addressing the conservative Justices' primary concerns with upholding the mandate.

We develop an argument about the limits of policy feedback to illuminate the obstacles to durable liberal reform in the contemporary American state. We argue that political scientists have paid insufficient attention to the fragility of inherited policy commitments, and that the capacity of reforms to remake politics is contingent, conditional, and contested.

This article sought to predict, using transaction cost analysis, which hospices will acquire pediatric knowledge internally (insourcing) compared with purchasing knowledge through the external market (outsourcing). A set of propositions was developed about how transaction characteristics (ie, frequency, asset specificity, uncertainty) may affect the internal or external acquisition of pediatric hospice care knowledge. The analysis revealed that there is a greater probability of hospices acquiring internal pediatric hospice care knowledge in an environment of high frequency, high asset specificity, and high uncertainty.

Enrollees move from state to state, but their migration patterns have remained largely unknown. There are concerns about the possibility of enrollment gaps, lack of health insurance coverage, breaks in continuity of care, unmet need, risks to health status, and increased system-wide costs due to uncompensated care and the use of higher cost emergency room services because of enrollment gaps. There is also concern about the extent to which people enrolled in more than one state are double counted. Objective: To examine the migration of Medicaid enrollees across states. Methods: We use 2005-2007 Medicaid enrollment records that were unduplicated and linked across states and over the study period. We report descriptive statistics on enrollee migration across states. Results: Among all enrollees, 3.7 percent moved to another state at least once and most moved only once. Overall, 72.2 percent of moves did not result in an enrollment gap, whereas 8.2 percent of moves resulted in gaps of fewer than three months, and 11.4 percent of moves resulted in gaps of more than six months. Conclusions: These initial findings provide a context for further examining the consequences of enrollee moves on their health and on program expenditures. The consequences of enrollment gaps will become increasingly important as the Medicaid population grows under the provisions of the Affordable Care Act."

The US health system has both considerable strengths and notable weaknesses. It has a large and well-trained health workforce, a wide range of high-quality medical specialists as well as secondary and tertiary institutions, a robust health sector research program and, for selected services, among the best medical outcomes in the world. But it also suffers from incomplete coverage of its citizenry, health expenditure levels per person far exceeding all other countries, poor measures on many objective and subjective measures of quality and outcomes, an unequal distribution of resources and outcomes across the country and among different population groups, and lagging efforts to introduce health information technology. It is difficult to determine the extent to which deficiencies are health-system related, though it seems that at least some of the problems are a result of poor access to care. Because of the adoption of the Affordable Care Act in 2010, the United States is facing a period of enormous potential change. Improving coverage is a central aim, envisaged through subsidies for the uninsured to purchase private insurance, expanded eligibility for Medicaid (in some states) and greater protection for insured persons. Furthermore, primary care and public health receive increased funding, and quality and expenditures are addressed through a range of measures.

However, the industry's R&D spending is driven primarily by the mass and research intensity of the biopharmaceutical sector, which accounts for nearly 85% of all expenditures. The life science industry's research activities in the United States continue to lead the world, but it is an area that also remains in significant transition. Not only is life science-led by the biopharmaceutical sector-the leading U.S. industry in terms of volume of research, U.S. life science R&D accounts for 46% of the global total-one of the highest shares in any industry. Still, pressures persist to improve on productivity, product pipelines and ROI in consideration of expiring patents, cost pressures and the rising complexity of innovation in drug development. While primarily affecting the biopharmaceutical sector, the medical device sector is not immune to some of these trends. A new factor complicating the R&D environment for the life science industry is the set of changes in the U.S. healthcare landscape mandated by the Affordable Care Act. While it is hard to predict exactly how this new law will affect life science R&D, these transitions and uncertainties suggest that while the U.S. remains a global leader life science R&D, it is vulnerable, especially as European competitors and new, emerging Asian competitors target life science research for growth. For the U.S. life science industry, we project a small rebound over 2013 levels (up 2.2%) to R&D spending of about $93 billion in 2014, with the growth coming primarily from smaller biopharmaceutical innovators and medical device manufacturers. The global expansion of the life science industry has slowed over the last few years, but the industry is forecast to have a stronger recovery (up 3.1%) to more than $201 billion in 2014."

State medical boards and other entities maintain data on physician licensure and discipline, as well as some biographical data describing their physician populations. However, there are gaps of workforce information in these sources. The Federation of State Medical Boards' (FSMB) Census of Licensed Physicians and the AMA Masterfile, for example, offer valuable information, but they provide a limited picture of the physician workforce. Furthermore, they are unable to shed light on some of the nuances in physician availability, such as how much time physicians spend providing direct patient care. In response to these gaps, policymakers and regulators have in recent years discussed the creation of a physician minimum data set (MDS), which would be gathered periodically and would provide key physician workforce information. While proponents of an MDS believe it would provide benefits to a variety of stakeholders, an effort has not been attempted to determine whether state medical boards think it is important to collect physician workforce data and if they currently collect workforce information from licensed physicians. To learn more, the FSMB sent surveys to the executive directors at state medical boards to determine their perceptions of collecting workforce data and current practices regarding their collection of such data. The purpose of this article is to convey results from this effort. Survey findings indicate that the vast majority of boards view physician workforce information as valuable in the determination of health care needs within their state, and that various boards are already collecting some data elements. Analysis of the data confirms the potential benefits of a physician minimum data set MDS and why state medical boards are in a unique position to collect MDS information from physicians.

The majority of spending on healthcare however, comes from government expenditure on health programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, Tricare, and the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP).4 Medicare is a federal government funded social insurance program that provides health insurance to people aged 65 and older, younger people with disabilities, and those with end stage renal failure requiring dialysis. Medicaid is a means tested insurance coverage program for individuals with low incomes and their families, and is jointly funded by state and federal governments. Tricare is a healthcare program that provides healthcare insurance for military personnel, retirees, and their dependents. The SCHIP provides states with federal government funding to provide health insurance to children from families with modest incomes that do not qualify for Medicaid.

Sebelius (NFIB), the Supreme Court ruled that the federal government cannot threaten to take away Medicaid funding from a state that refuses to participate in the expansion of Medicaid mandated by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The Court's decision was momentous since it was the first time that it found a federal conditional spending program to be unconstitutionally coercive. The Court's holding will almost certainly lead to legal challenges of federal conditional spending programs, particularly the Clean Air Act (CAA). Under section 179 of that statute, the federal government may impose highway fund sanctions on any state that has a deficient or incomplete State Implementation Plan. Despite the concerns of prominent legal scholars regarding the constitutionality of section 179 following NFIB, this Note argues that the decision does not shake the statute's constitutional underpinnings. The CAA is distinguishable in several key respects. First, the availability of a Federal Implementation Plan under the CAA provides a viable alternative to the loss of highway funds. NFIB is a unique case, given that a state's loss of Medicaid funds would have affected vulnerable populations, and the beneficiaries of highway funds differ in their need and dependency. Furthermore, states can turn down highway funds more easily than Medicaidfunds, since states receive fewer federal dollars for highways than for Medicaid, both as a total and as a percentage. This Note also argues that states had adequate notice of the conditions imposed for receipt of highway funding, and section 179 sanctions are sufficiently related to the goals of the CAA, given the ties between transportation and air pollution, for example. Indeed, invalidation of section 179 would undermine federalism by disturbing the delicate balance of power between the federal government and states with respect to clean air protection. Thus, section 179 should survive a facial or as-applied challenge."

As analyses of the impact of board certification continue, the consequences of board certification status should be examined to evaluate its effect on physician practice characteristics. We studied the effects of board certification on the practice characteristics of general pediatricians, pediatric medical subspecialists, and pediatric surgical specialists and examined the impact of noncertification on Maintenance of Licensure MOL and state medical and osteopathic boards. The study utilized the subset of pediatrician respondents to the 2009 Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) Survey of Primary Care Physicians. This mail survey was fielded in three rounds in the second half of 2009. The adjusted overall response rate for the survey was 37.6%, but was 49.5% for pediatricians. Data were analyzed using SPSS 18.0. The study found that board certification status is significantly associated with key practice characteristics such as capacity, practice location, and hours worked, and there are differences in the practice characteristics of board certified versus non-board certified general pediatricians, pediatric medical subspecialists, and pediatric surgical specialists. Consequently, advocating for increased levels of board certification may have unanticipated implications for patient access to care. As the majority of pediatricians are board certified, workforce planners should consider and acknowledge these differences when engaging in planning initiatives, particularly in the context of Maintenance of Certification (MOC), MOL, and the expansion of access to care under the Affordable Care Act (ACA).

At the county level, the health care and social services sector is typically the largest or second largest employer. Hospital employment is often the largest component of the sector's total employment. Hospital employment is particularly important to non-metropolitan or rural communities. A high quality healthcare sector serves to promote economic development and attract new businesses and to provide stability in economic downturns. The purpose of this study was to examine the intensity of hospital employment in rural counties relative to the nation as a whole using location quotients and to draw conclusions regarding how potential changes in Medicare and Medicaid might affect rural populations. Estimates for county-level hospital employment are not commonly available. Estimates of county-level hospital employment were therefore generated for all counties in the USA the Census Bureau's County Business Pattern Data for 2010. These estimates were used to generate location quotients for each county which were combined with demographic data to generate a profile of factors that are related to the magnitude of location quotients. The results were then used to draw inferences regarding the possible impact of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act 2010 (ACA) and the possible imposition of aspects of the Budget Control Act 2011 (BCA). Although a very high percentage of rural counties contain medically underserved areas, an examination of location quotients indicates that the percentage of the county workforce employed by hospitals in the most rural counties tends to be higher than for the nation as a whole, a counterintuitive finding. Further, when location quotients are regressed upon data related to poverty, county demographics, and the percentage of the population insured, a relationship between the proportion of the population over 65 years, the percentage of the population living in poverty, the percentage of the population without insurance and county density was found. The results of the analysis suggest that hospital employment in rural communities is higher than would be expected in the absence of programs that provide external funding to support hospital hiring. The most important public programs providing this support are Medicare and Medicaid. Social Security is another source of federal funding important for rural populations. Sequestration and other cuts in funding could impact rural communities significantly. This can be even worse in states that fail to expand Medicaid and in states that fail to increase Medicaid reimbursements for services important in rural communities."

Patents, which are administered by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), provide their owner with the ability to exclude others from practicing the claimed invention for a limited time. In contrast, regulatory exclusivities are administered by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Alternatively known as marketing exclusivities, data exclusivities, or data protection, regulatory exclusivities establish a period of time during which the FDA affords an approved drug protection from competing applications for marketing approval. Although patents and regulatory exclusivities are separate entitlements that are administered by different federal administrative agencies and that depend upon distinct criteria, they both create proprietary rights in pharmaceutical and biologics innovation. These rights allow innovators to receive a return on the expenditure of resources leading to a discovery. Once these proprietary interests expire, the marketplace for that drug is open to generic or follow-on competition. Congressional interest in promoting both innovation and competition in the pharmaceutical industry has focused attention on both patents and regulatory exclusivities. For example, the 112th Congress proposed but did not enact the Modernizing Our Drug and Diagnostics Evaluation and Regulatory Network Cures Act, or MODDERN Cures Act (H.R. 3497). This bill confronted policy makers with a debate previously conducted by legal academics over the relative role of patents and regulatory exclusivities in promoting pharmaceutical and biotechnology R&D. In addition, the Obama Administration has proposed a reduction in the regulatory exclusivity offered to brand-name biologic drugs to seven years, down from the 12 years incorporated in the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (enacted as Title VII of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act). Controversy has surrounded the award of regulatory exclusivities to colchicine, an ancient remedy for gout that was subject to the FDA's Unapproved Drugs Initiative. International agreements require each World Trade Organization (WTO) member state to treat all patented inventions in the same manner. This rule seemingly prohibits discrimination both against and in favor of patents on drugs as compared to other technologies. As a result, regulatory exclusivities provide Congress with a more flexible option for stimulating specific sorts of desirable private activity than do patents. The WTO Agreements, as well as certain Free Trade Agreements to which the United States is a signatory, also obligate nations to provide some manner of protection to pharmaceutical test data.

Drexel Furniture Co., more commonly known as the Child Labor Tax Case. There the Court invalidated a provision of the Revenue Act of 1918 imposing an excise of ten percent on the net profits of all firms employing children under specified ages in various tasks, for longer than specified hours, or at night work. The Child Labor Tax Case was followed in other, similar cases in the 1920s and 1930s, and the Court continued to treat those precedents as good law throughout the remainder of the twentieth century. Chief Justice Roberts did not reject the authority of the Child Labor Tax Case. Instead, he reviewed the features of the Child Labor Tax that had prompted Chief Justice Taft and his colleagues to conclude that the measure imposed a regulatory penalty, and then offered several distinctions between the ACA and the earlier exaction. But a review of the reaction of child labor reformers to the 1922 decision suggests that contemporaries would not have regarded those distinctions as constitutionally significant. For child labor advocates in the 1920s did not believe that if they revised the measure to remove those objectionable features, the tax would then pass constitutional muster. Instead, they regarded the idea of such a constitutional excise as hopeless, and turned their attention to an unsuccessful effort to amend the Constitution to permit Congress to enact federal child labor legislation. This Article proceeds as follows: Part I provides an overview of the relevant twentieth-century taxing power precedents. Part II reviews the decisions of the lower federal courts concerning the construction and constitutionality of the ACA as a taxing measure. Part III canvasses the arguments made in the briefs submitted to the Court, observing that the decisive taxing power issue received scant attention from the parties. Part IV scrutinizes Chief Justice Roberts's efforts to distinguish the Child Labor Tax Case, concluding that if the assessment of that decision by contemporary observers was accurate, each of those distinctions is insufficient. Part V draws on the contemporaneous analysis of Professor Thomas Reed Powell to isolate the core principle emerging from the Child Labor Tax Case and its progeny: that a nominal tax is in fact a regulatory penalty where it imposes an exaction triggered by departure from a detailed and specified course of conduct, and the exaction is sufficiently onerous to induce those engaged in the targeted conduct generally to alter their behavior. Part VI presents an argument, not considered by the Court, that the ACA might be understood to impose a regulatory penalty so defined. If that understanding is correct, then the Court may have effectively overruled the Child Labor Tax Case and its progeny sub silentio, thereby substantially transforming taxing power doctrine. Part VII explores an alternative, albeit considerably less likely possibility: that contemporary child labor reformers misunderstood the Child Labor Tax Case, and could have successfully revised and defended a new Child Labor Tax by altering one or more of the distinguishing features identified by Chief Justice Roberts. If that is so, then that unfortunate generation of social activists squandered fifteen years in fruitless pursuit of a constitutional amendment authorizing Congress to regulate the labor of children, when a much easier and more expeditious solution lay right before their eyes. © 2013 Barry Cushman."

Four of 5 patients who visit a medical provider leave with at least 1 prescription. Though medications rank as the number one intervention in healthcare, pharmacists are not fully utilized nor appropriately recognized to maximally manage these therapies in patients along with prescribers though they are well educated and trained to do so. The Social Security Act does not recognize pharmacists as non-physician healthcare providers, though they represent the third-highest number of licensed healthcare providers in the United States. Pharmacists are one of the most accessible healthcare providers in urban, suburban, and rural areas and patients interact with them more often than with their primary care providers. The exclusion of pharmacists is incongruent with legislative changes and policy initiatives. There are multiple models of care where pharmacists are practicing within the full scope of their licensure on healthcare teams where improved patient outcomes have been demonstrated through medication management services. Continued exclusion of pharmacists from provider status recognition could negatively impact patient outcomes and result in unnecessary health-related costs, as the third largest healthcare provider is unable to communicate with other healthcare team members and patients alike surrounding a key intervention, medications."

This presents an unprecedented opportunity to use population health data for the benefit of patient-centered outcomes. However, there are two major hurdles to utilizing this wealth of data. First, medical data is not centrally located but is often divided across hospital systems, health exchanges, and physician practices. Second, sharing specific or identifiable information may not be allowed. Moreover, organizations may have a vested interest in keeping their data sets private as they may have been gathered and curated at great cost. We develop an approach to allow the sharing of beneficial information while staying within the bounds of data privacy. We show that the use of a probabilistic graphical model can facilitate effective transfer learning between distinct healthcare data sets by parameter sharing while simultaneously allowing us to construct a network for interpretation use by domain experts and the discovery of disease relationships.

What was once a set of independent hospitals having arms-length relationships with physicians and clinicians who provide ambulatory care is becoming a small number of locally integrated health systems, generally built around large, prestigious academic medical centers. The typical region in the United States has 3 to 5 consolidated health systems, spanning a wide range of care settings, and a smaller fringe of health care centers outside those systems. Consolidated health systems have advantages and drawbacks. The advantages include the ability to coordinate care across different practitioners and sites of care. Offsetting this is the potential for higher prices resulting from greater market power. Market power increases because it is difficult for insurers to bargain successfully with one of only a few health systems. Antitrust authorities are examining these consolidated systems as they form, but broad conclusions are difficult to draw because typically the creation of a system will generate both benefit and harm and each set of facts will be different. Moreover, the remedies traditionally used (eg, blocking the transaction or requiring that the parties divest assets) by antitrust authorities in cases of net harm are limited. For this reason, local governments may want to introduce new policies that help ensure consumers gain protection in the event of consolidation, such as insurance products that charge consumers more for high-priced clinicians and health care centers, bundling payments to clinicians and health care organizations to eliminate the incentives of big institutions to simply provide more care, and establishing area-specific price or spending targets.

At the county level, the health care and social services sector is typically the largest or second largest employer. Hospital employment is often the largest component of the sector's total employment. Hospital employment is particularly important to non-metropolitan or rural communities. A high quality healthcare sector serves to promote economic development and attract new businesses and to provide stability in economic downturns. The purpose of this study was to examine the intensity of hospital employment in rural counties relative to the nation as a whole using location quotients and to draw conclusions regarding how potential changes in Medicare and Medicaid might affect rural populations. Methods: Estimates for county-level hospital employment are not commonly available. Estimates of county-level hospital employment were therefore generated for all counties in the USA the Census Bureau's County Business Pattern Data for 2010. These estimates were used to generate location quotients for each county which were combined with demographic data to generate a profile of factors that are related to the magnitude of location quotients. The results were then used to draw inferences regarding the possible impact of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act 2010 (ACA) and the possible imposition of aspects of the Budget Control Act 2011 (BCA). Results: Although a very high percentage of rural counties contain medically underserved areas, an examination of location quotients indicates that the percentage of the county workforce employed by hospitals in the most rural counties tends to be higher than for the nation as a whole, a counterintuitive finding. Further, when location quotients are regressed upon data related to poverty, county demographics, and the percentage of the population insured, a relationship between the proportion of the population over 65 years, the percentage of the population living in poverty, the percentage of the population without insurance and county density was found. Conclusion: The results of the analysis suggest that hospital employment in rural communities is higher than would be expected in the absence of programs that provide external funding to support hospital hiring. The most important public programs providing this support are Medicare and Medicaid. Social Security is another source of federal funding important for rural populations. Sequestration and other cuts in funding could impact rural communities significantly. This can be even worse in states that fail to expand Medicaid and in states that fail to increase Medicaid reimbursements for services important in rural communities. © JL Smith, 2013."

Eighty percent of offering firms use brokers who commonly perform functions of benefit managers-functions that the SHOP exchanges may assume. Twenty-six percent of firms using brokers reported discussing self-insuring with their brokers.

The Affordable Care Act requires most private insurance plans to cover contraceptive services without patient cost-sharing. Whether this mandate will increase LARC use is unknown. Objective: To assess the relationship between cost-sharing and use of LARC among privately insured women. Design: Cross-sectional analysis using Truven Health MarketScan data from January 2011 to December 2011. Subjects: Women aged 14-45 years with continuous insurance coverage enrolled in health plan products that covered branded and generic oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) and intrauterine devices (IUDs). We selected women using OCPs and IUDs as these are the most commonly used short-acting and long-acting reversible methods, respectively (N=1,682,425). Measures: Multivariable regression was used to assess the association of the level of out-of-pocket costs for IUDs for each patient's plan and IUD initiation, adjusting for out-of-pocket costs for branded and generic OCPs and patient characteristics. Results: Overall, 5.5% of women initiated an IUD in 2011. After adjustment, IUD initiation was less likely among women with higher versus lower co-pays (adjusted risk ratio=0.65; 95% CI, 0.64-0.67). Women who saw an obstetrician/gynecologist during 2011 were more likely to initiate an IUD (adjusted risk ratio=2.49; 95% CI, 2.45-2.53). Conclusions: Rates of IUD use are low among privately insured women in the United States, and higher cost-sharing is associated with lower rates of IUD use. Together with other measures to promote LARC use, eliminating co-pays for contraception could promote the use of these more effective and cost-effective methods. © 2013 by Lippincott Williams and Wilkins."

Authorized and funded at $1.5 billion for 5 years, the MIECHV represents a large investment in health and development outcomes for at-risk children through evidence-based home visiting programs. The MIECHV presents unprecedented opportunities to integrate early childhood services systems, not only on the federal level but also within states and local communities. The MIECHV is funded in escalating amounts over 5-year period authorized, as follows: $100 million in fiscal year (FY) 2010, $250 million in FY 2011, $350 million in FY 2012, $400 million in FY 2013, and $400 million in FY 2014.

Since 2011, California has transitioned PLWHA to Medicaid managed care (MMC) and to the Low-Income Health Program (LIHP). OBJECTIVES: To draw lessons for the ACA implementation from the transitions into MMC and the LIHP. METHODS: Surveys about clients and services provided before and after the transition to MMC and the LIHP were sent to 43 HIV service providers. Usable responses were obtained from 18 (42%). RESULTS: Although total client loads were similar in the pre- (January 2011) and posttransition periods (June 2012), many clients transitioned from fee-for-service (FFS) Medicaid to MMC. Over this period, responding agencies served 43.5% fewer PLWHA in FFS Medicaid, whereas the share of PLWHA covered by MMC rose from 16.9% to 55.5%. Managed care covered a smaller number of services than either FFS Medicaid or Ryan White sites. Ryan White providers reported that 53% of the clients they served in January 2011 had transitioned to the LIHPs. Nonetheless, they continued to provide services to many of these clients, and Ryan White caseloads did not decline. CONCLUSIONS: PLWHA enrolled in the MMC continue to depend on Ryan White sites to supply the full range of services that will allow them to take full advantage of increased access to care under ACA.

Sebelius (2012), a majority of the justices affirmed Congress's power to expand Medicaid and impose an individual mandate requiring people to obtain health insurance or face increasing tax penalties. The Court's decision was widely condemned as a dramatic expansion of federal power that threatened state sovereignty and individual liberty. The Court was heavily criticized for betraying the principles of federalism and limited government in the U.S. Constitution. The harshest criticism was reserved for Chief Justice John Roberts, a Republican appointee who-though considered a conservative justice-authored the Court's opinion and cast the critical deciding vote to uphold the Act.

Less is known, however, about how these differences have changed over time. Objectives: This study tracks changes over time in the distribution of preventive services use across groups defined by poverty status, race/ethnicity, insurance coverage, Census region, and urbanicity. Methods: Data from the 1996-2008 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey are used to examine 5 preventive services: general checkups, blood pressure screening, blood cholesterol screening, Pap smears, and mammograms. Multivariate logistic regression models of preventive services use are used to compute adjusted utilization for each subgroup of adults aged 19-64 in 1996/1998, 2002/2003, and 2007/2008. We then examine the extent to which percentage point gaps in utilization rates across subgroups have changed between 1996/1998 and 2007/2008. Results: Our analysis of utilization rates across subgroups and over time identified only rare cases in which subgroup differences narrowed or widened between 1996/1998 and 2007/2008. Rather, differences across subgroups tended to persist over time. Some of the largest (adjusted) gaps are between adults with and without coverage, and only for blood cholesterol screening do we observe significant narrowing of the gap between the uninsured and the privately insured. Regional differences persisted or widened over the study period.

Objectives: The objective of the study was to consider the impact of changes in market-level Medicaid coverage on measures of physician participation in care for safety net populations. Research Design: We use 4 waves of the Community Tracking Study Physician Survey from 1996 to 2005. We estimate both market-level and physician-level fixed effects models, to consider changes in market-level Medicaid rates on measures of physician acceptance of new patients (both Medicaid patients and uninsured patients unable to pay), revenue from Medicaid, and provision of charity care. We also stratify the sample to investigate whether effects differ among office-based versus facility-based physicians. Results: Increases in Medicaid coverage are associated with statistically significant decreases in the likelihood that physicians will accept new uninsured patients who are unable to pay, particularly among office-based physicians. Increases in Medicaid coverage are not associated with changes in acceptance of new Medicaid patients.

The act stipulates that 75% of the funds must be used for programs with evidence of effectiveness based on rigorous evaluation research. Home Visiting Evidence of Effectiveness reviewed the home visiting research literature and provided an assessment of the evidence of effectiveness for program models that serve families with pregnant women and children from birth to age 5. METHODS: Home Visiting Evidence of Effectiveness included a systematic search and screening process, a review of the research quality, and an assessment of program effectiveness. Reviewers rated studies' capacity to provide unbiased estimates of program impacts and determined whether a program met the Department of Health and Human Services' criteria for an evidence-based model. RESULTS: As of July 2012, 32 models were reviewed, of which 12 met the Department of Health and Human Services criteria. Most of these models were shown to have favorable effects on child development. Other common favorable effects included health care usage and reductions in child maltreatment. Less common were favorable effects on birth outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Home visiting is a promising way to serve families who may be difficult to engage in supportive services.

While there may be subjective improvements in appearance, it is important to determine if these interventions have an impact on patients in other realms such as psychosocial functioning. This is particularly important in light of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and its emphasis on patient-centered outcomes and effectiveness. OBJECTIVES: To review the literature investigating the impact of facial cosmetic surgery and minimally invasive procedures on relevant psychological variables to guide clinical practice and set norms for clinical performance. EVIDENCE REVIEW: English-language randomized clinical trials and prospective cohort studies that preoperatively and postoperatively assessed psychological variables in at least 10 patients seeking surgical or minimally invasive cosmetic procedures of the face. FINDINGS: Only 1 study investigating minimally invasive procedures was identified. Most studies reported modest improvement in psychosocial functioning, which included quality of life, self-esteem, and body image. Unfortunately, the overall quality of evidence is limited owing to an absence of control groups, short follow-up periods, or loss to follow-up. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The current literature suggests that a number of psychosocial domains may improve following facial cosmetic surgery, although the quality of this evidence is limited (grade of recommendation 2A). Despite the dramatic rise in nonsurgical cosmetic procedures, there is a paucity of information regarding the impact of chemodenervation and soft-tissue augmentation on psychosocial functioning.

International Board Certified Lactation Consultants (IBCLCs) are key providers of lactation services. In order to inform national discussion, this study examines the scope of insurance reimbursement of IBCLC services. Objectives: An email survey of US IBCLCs (N = 10 495) in March 2011 was used to explore frequencies of (1) submission-how often lactation consults were submitted to insurance providers for reimbursement and (2) recognition-the proportion of submitted charges recognized by insurance providers. Methods: Results (N = 2045) were analyzed to describe patterns of submission and recognition by IBCLC work setting, job classification, and reimbursement strategy. Results: Many survey respondents did not know their submission (41%) or recognition (57%) levels. Multiple strategies were used for reimbursement of IBCLC services with large variations in recognition between strategies. Overall, less than 15% reported high levels of submissions to insurance providers. Moreover, of submitted encounters, only 4% were consistently recognized by insurance providers. Inpatient hospital IBCLCs were least likely to have consults recognized (3%), and private community IBCLCs were most frequently recognized (32%). Compared with using IBCLC credentials for submitting an encounter, using another clinical license was the most successful strategy for achieving recognition of IBCLC consults (crude risk ratio, 1.44; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-2.01; P = .02). Conclusion: IBCLCs provide key care to a vulnerable population. However, we found that these services are not consistently reimbursed.

To determine which hospital and patient factors predict variation in all discharge hospital readmission rates, a 5% sample of all Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries with continuous Part A and B coverage was examined for the first 9 months of 2008 in combination with other administrative data available to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. We included age, sex, race, dual-eligibility status, number of comorbid conditions, geographic region, hospital case mix, and reason for entitlement in the multiple regression model to assess how they influenced the 30-day readmission rate. Beneficiaries with 10 or more chronic conditions were more than 6 times more likely to be readmitted than beneficiaries with 1 to 4 chronic conditions. These beneficiaries represent only 8.9% of all Medicare beneficiaries (31.0% of all hospitalizations), but they were responsible for 50.2% of all readmissions. The 31.8% of beneficiaries with 5 to 9 chronic conditions (55.5% of all hospitalizations) had the second highest odds ratio (2.5) and were responsible for 45% of all readmissions. © 2013 Society of Hospital Medicine."

Physicians were identified as surgeons and classified into surgical groups using a combination of American Medical Association primary and secondary self-reported specialties and American Board of Medical Specialties certifications. From these groups, urologic surgeons were isolated for analysis. The supply of urologists per capita has declined since 1981 - most dramatically since 1991. With an average age of 52.5 years, urology is one of the oldest surgical specialties. Over 7% of urologists are older than 70 years and 44% are older than 55 years, suggesting an aging urology workforce. The number of female urologists has grown almost a 1000-fold and represents a growing and younger cohort of the workforce. The number of rural urologists and the number of international medical graduates have continued to decline since 1981. Over the past 10 years, an increasing number of urologists are now in group practices (over 60%), and these tended to be younger and in urban settings. In contrast to most other surgical specialties, there has been a decrease in the supply of urologists relative to population growth, which is expected to be exacerbated by an aging and relatively older urology physician workforce, particularly in rural areas, a slight increase in female urologists, and the gravitation of younger urologists toward group practice in urban areas. © 2013 Elsevier Inc."

Faster growth typically occurred in less urban areas that had a large market share of for-profit hospitals. (2) By 2008-2009, elderly patients were going to the hospital at the same rate as in the mid-1990s, but their stays were much shorter, and they received much more intensive services.

A fourth strategy deserves more attention: waste less. This article examines the remarkable inefficiency and waste in primary care today and highlights practices that have addressed these problems. For example, delegating certain administrative tasks such as managing task lists in the electronic health record can give physicians more time to see additional patients. Flow managers who guide physicians from task to task throughout the clinical day have been shown to improve physicians' efficiency and capacity. Even something as simple as placing a printer in every exam room can save each physician twenty minutes per day. Modest but systemwide improvements could yield dramatic gains in physician capacity while potentially reducing physician burnout and its implications for the quality of care.

The term refers to separate billing for each discrete aspect of a surgical or interventional procedure, and has typically allowed billing the procedural activity, such as catheterization of vessels, separately from the diagnostic evaluation of radiographic images. This work is captured by supervision and interpretation codes. Benefits of component coding will be reviewed in this article. The American Medical Association/Specialty Society Relative Value Scale Update Committee has been filtering for codes that are frequently reported together. NeuroInterventional procedures are going to be caught in this filter as our codes are often reported simultaneously as for example routinely occurs when procedural codes are coupled to those for supervision and interpretation. Unfortunately, history has shown that when bundled codes have been reviewed at the RUC, there has been a trend to lower overall RVU value for the combined service compared with the sum of the values of the separate services."

We explore how such applications designed for providers and patients will affect the future demand for physicians. We performed what we believe to be the most comprehensive review of the literature to date, including previously published systematic reviews and relevant individual studies. We estimate that if health IT were fully implemented in 30 percent of community-based physicians' offices, the demand for physicians would be reduced by about 4-9 percent. Delegation of care to nurse practitioners and physician assistants supported by health IT could reduce the future demand for physicians by 4-7 percent. Similarly, IT-supported delegation from specialist physicians to generalists could reduce the demand for specialists by 2-5 percent. The use of health IT could also help address regional shortages of physicians by potentially enabling 12 percent of care to be delivered remotely or asynchronously. These estimated impacts could more than double if comprehensive health IT systems were adopted by 70 percent of US ambulatory care delivery settings.

We found that projected physician shortages were substantially reduced in plausible scenarios that envisioned greater reliance on these new models, even without increases in the supply of physicians. Some less plausible scenarios even eliminated the shortage. All of these scenarios, however, may require additional changes, such as liberalized scope-of-practice laws; a larger supply of medical assistants, licensed practical nurses, and aides; and payment changes that reward providers for population health management. © 2013 Project HOPE - The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc."

We assessed whether homeless adults entering substance abuse treatment in Massachusetts were less likely than others to enroll in Medicaid after implementation of the MassHealth Medicaid expansion program in 1997. Methods. We used interrupted time-series analysis in data on substance abuse treatment admissions from the Treatment Episode Data Set (1992-2009) to evaluate Medicaid coverage rates in Massachusetts and to identify whether trends differed between homeless and housed participants. We also compared Massachusetts data with data from 17 other states and the District of Columbia combined. Results. The percentage of both homeless and housed people entering treatment with Medicaid increased approximately 21% after expansion (P = .01), with an average increase of 5.4% per year over 12 years (P = .01). The increase in coverage was specific to Massachusetts, providing evidence that the MassHealth policy was the cause of this increase. Conclusions. Findings provide evidence in favor of state participation in the Medicaid expansion in January 2014 under the Affordable Care Act and suggest that hard-to-reach vulnerable groups such as substance-abusing homeless adults are as likely as other population groups to benefit from this policy.

Methods: We identified demographics, HIV infection status, and ED utilization patterns in 2009 and 2010 from a weighted sample of US ED visits using the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, a nationally representative survey. Data on visits by patients aged ≥13 years were analysed using procedures for multiple-stage survey data. Results: In 2009 and 2010, 1192535 visits were documented for HIV-infected patients. The estimated annual ED visit rates were 633 per 1000 known HIV-infected persons and 438 per 1000 non-HIV-infected persons [rate difference 195; 95% confidence interval (CI) 194, 197]. While no difference was recorded in the level of acuity between HIV-infected ED patients and general ED patients, the total number of diagnostic/screening services ordered and medications administered in the ED was significantly higher for visits by HIV-infected patients. HIV-infected patients making ED visits also had a longer duration of stays [mean 5.4h (95% CI 4.6, 6.2h) vs. 3.6h (95% CI 3.5, 3.8h) for HIV-uninfected patients] and were more likely to be admitted [28% (95% CI 22, 34%) vs. 15% (95% CI 14, 16%), respectively] than their non-HIV-infected counterparts. Conclusions: ED visits by HIV-infected individuals occur at rates higher than those of visits by the general population, and consume significantly more ED resources than visits by the general population.

Methods: We use data from the Relate Project (n=332), a unique cross-sectional survey of recently released men and their female partners (2009-2011), to demonstrate that the female partners of recently released men suffer from a variety of health risks and conditions. We also examine the health conditions of females by their own incarceration history. Findings: We find that these women engage in poor health behaviors including smoking, drug use, and excessive alcohol consumption and have high levels of health conditions including asthma, hypertension, anxiety, and depression. The vulnerability of women who had themselves been incarcerated in jails or prisons was especially acute. The number of risky background characteristics such as dropping out of high school (45%) and spending time in foster care or a group home (36%) were staggeringly high for ever-imprisoned women, as were their rates of anxiety (50%), depression (59%), and posttraumatic stress disorder (45%).

National interest considerations urge that reformulation center on better matching the law's aspirations with new realities rather than abstract ideals. Constraints on government spending and the risks public indebtedness pose for the national economy compel a pragmatic reassessment of entitlement policy in the light of what is affordable. ObamaCare compounds the government's unsustainable debt and deficit problem, promising benefits that are overly generous and lack effective cost controls. Fiscal imperatives compel that scarce government resources be targeted on the truly needy and that individuals capable of doing so assume a greater responsibility for their health care. They also necessitate a more sophisticated public-private partnership than provided in the new health law in order to capture the benefits of market competition that facilitate innovation, circumvent political stalemate, confine the inflationary effects of services perceived to be free goods, and provide incentives that reward individuals for becoming more cost-conscious users of health services. Finally, the harnessing of self-interest is presented as a superior alternative to centralized command and control methods for influencing health behavior and keeping health spending under control. In the interest of economy and efficiency, government involvement, following the subsidization of low income persons on a sliding scale basis, should concentrate on standard setting, monitoring and evaluating productivity and quality improvement practices. Ultimately, living standards contribute more to health status than do health services, and this requires investment directed at economic growth. © 2013 International Atlantic Economic Society."

U.S. reforms are under way to lower costs and raise quality of care, notably the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA). Value-based purchasing (VBP) and programs for reducing the incidence of hospital-acquired conditions (HACs) and hospital readmissions represent initial changes. With these programs, overarching themes are to coordinate care during and beyond hospitalization and to ensure that physicians and hospitals are aligned in their treatment strategies. Hospital malnutrition represents a large, hidden, and costly component of medical care; hospital administrators and caregivers alike must harness the benefits of nutrition as a vital component of healthcare. Medical, nursing, and allied health training programs must find places in their curricula to increase awareness of nutrition and promote knowledge of best-practice nutrition interventions. Hospitals use dietitians and nutrition support teams as critical members of the patient care team, but more work needs to be done to disseminate and enforce best nutrition practices. Such training, nutrition interventions, and practice changes can help prevent and treat malnutrition and thus help avert HACs, reduce hospital readmissions, lower infection and complication rates, and shorten hospital stays. Nutrition care is an effective way to reduce costs and improve patient outcomes. This article calls hospital executives and bedside clinicians to action: recognize the value of nutrition care before, during, and after hospitalization, as well as develop training programs and policies that promote nutrition care. © 2013 American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition."

We used the Balanced Budget Act (BBA) of 1997 as a natural experiment to study the long-term consequence of major payment reductions on patient outcomes. Objectives: To analyze whether mortality trends diverge over the years between hospitals facing different levels of payment cuts because of the BBA for 5 leading conditions: acute myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, stroke, pneumonia, and hip fracture. Research Design: Using 100% Medicare claims between 1995 and 2005, hospital database, and published reports on BBA policy components, we compared changes in outcomes between hospitals facing small and large BBA payment reductions across 3 periods (pre-BBA, initial-BBA, and post-BBA) using instrumental variable hospital fixed-effects regression models. Setting: All general, acute, nonrural, short-stay hospitals in the United States 1995 - 2005. MAIN Outcome Measures: Hospital risk-adjusted mortality rates (7, 30, 90 d, and 1 y). Results: Mortality trends between hospitals in small and large payment-cut categories were similar between pre-BBA and initial-BBA periods, but diverged in the post-BBA period. Relative to the small-cut hospitals, hospitals in the large-cut category experienced smaller decline in 1-year mortality rates in the post-BBA period compared with their pre-BBA trends by 0.8-1.4 percentage points, depending on the condition (P<0.05 for all conditions, except for hip fracture). Conclusion: We found consistent evidence across multiple conditions that reductions in Medicare payments are associated with slower improvement in mortality outcomes. © 2013 by Lippincott Williams and Wilkins."

This study sought to assess whether strategic alignment of the human resource (HR) and learning functions was associated with greater adaptive capacity in U.S. health systems. Design/methodology/approach - Data were gathered using a survey that was distributed electronically to chief human resource officers from two U.S.-based associations. The survey included questions about organizational structure, strategic human resource management, strategic learning, and organizational response to health reform. Findings - Significant correlations were found between strategic alignment of HR and HR's involvement in responses related to cost control (r=0.46, p<0.01); quality improvement (r=0.45, p<0.01), and patient access (r=0.39, p<0.01). However, no significant relationships were found between strategic alignment of organizational learning and HR involvement with these responses. Value/originality - Results suggest that HR structure may affect an organization's capacity for adaptive response. Top-management teams in health systems should consider positioning HR as part of the core leadership team, with a reporting relationship that allows HR to maximally participate in formulating and implementing organizational adaptation.

Methods: Pooled, cross-sectional data for 178,937 women with live births from 1996 to 2008, who were insured by Medicaid in 34 states plus New York City, were used to analyze self-reported smoking before pregnancy (3 months), smoking during the last 3 months of pregnancy, smoking after delivery (3-4 months), infant birth weight, and gestational age at delivery. Maternal socio-demographic and behavior variables from survey data and birth outcomes from vital records were merged with annual state data on Medicaid coverage for nicotine replacement therapies (NRT), medications and cessation counseling. Probit and OLS regression models were used to test for effects of states' Medicaid cessation coverage on mother's smoking and infant outcomes relative to mothers in states without coverage. Results: Medicaid coverage of NRT and medications is associated with 1.6 percentage point reduction (p<.05) in smoking before pregnancy among Medicaid insured women relative to no coverage. Adding counseling coverage to NRT and medication coverage is associated with a 2.5 percentage point reduction in smoking before pregnancy (p<.10). Medicaid cessation coverage during pregnancy was associated with a small increase (<1 day) in infant gestation (p<.05). Conclusions: In this sample, Medicaid coverage of smoking cessation only affected women enrolled prior to pregnancy. Expansions of Medicaid eligibility to include more women prior to pregnancy in participating states, and mandated coverage of some cessation services without co-pays under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) should reduce the number of women smoking before pregnancy."

Some observers predict little aggregate effect, but others believe that 2014 will mark the beginning of the end for our current system of employersponsored insurance. We use theoretical and empirical evidence to address the question, ""How will employers' offerings of health insurance change under health reform?"" First, we describe the economic reasons why employers offer insurance. Second, we recap the relevant provisions of health reform and use our economic framework to consider how they may affect employers' offerings.

However, the data also show that other approaches could be even more effective in increasing physicians' willingness to see Medicaid patients. Those approaches include lowering the costs of participating in Medicaid by simplifying administrative processes, speeding up reimbursement, and reducing the costs associated with caring for those patients.

The act will alter the financial incentive structure for employers and influence their decisions on whether or not to offer their employees coverage. These decisions, in turn, will affect federal outlays and revenues through several mechanisms. We model the sensitivity of federal costs for the insurance exchange coverage provision of the Affordable Care Act using the nationally representative Medical Expenditure Panel Survey data set. We assess revenues and subsidy outlays for premiums and cost sharing for individuals purchasing private insurance through exchanges.

If income changes were reported and credits adjusted in a timely manner throughout the tax year, the number of filers owing repayments would be reduced by 7-41 percent and the median size of repayments reduced by as much as 61 percent (depending on the level of changes reported and the method used to adjust the subsidy amounts).

Fifty-three percent were uninsured or relied solely on state or local assistance, and 21 percent had other coverage that included Department of Veterans Affairs health care. The findings on differences in health status and service use across groups suggest that the Medicaid expansion offers important opportunities to increase coverage and access to care for chronically homeless adults.

As part of statewide health reform in 2006, Massachusetts expanded dental benefits to all adults ages 19-64 whose annual income was at or below 100 percent of the federal poverty level. We examined the impact of this reform and found that it led to an increase in dental care use among the Massachusetts adult population, driven by gains among poor adults. Compared to the prereform period, dental care use increased by 2.9 percentage points among all nonelderly adults in Massachusetts, relative to all nonelderly adults in eight control states. For poor Massachusetts adults, the effect was larger-an elevenpercentage- point increase in dental care use above the increase among the state's nonpoor residents. The Massachusetts experience provides evidence that providing dental benefits to poor adults through Medicaid can improve dental care access and use.

To guide implementation of the Affordable Care Act 2010 by estimating anticipated increases in medically attended injuries and site of care by the young who are currently uninsured. Methods. The 2008 National Health Interview Survey was used to estimate injury episodes and care site for uninsured and insured youth ≤26 years old. Increases in medically attended injuries were estimated by assuming that rates and care site for the currently uninsured would match those of the currently insured once the uninsured receive coverage. Results. In 2008, approximately 11 938 800 episodes of medically attended injuries occurred for youth ≤26 years. An anticipated 6.1% increase in medically attended injuries (737 081; 95% confidence interval = 564 000-879 000), the majority of which would be seen in the outpatient setting, could occur once all uninsured youth become insured.

Principal Findings Net private health insurance coverage increased by 4.6 percentage points and overall coverage increased by 4.2 percentage points for people aged 19-25; more for Whites than non-White subgroups. Conclusions and Implications Changes in coverage for states appear driven by demographics rather than the existence of prior dependent expansions by the state.

Data Sources AHRQ Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project State Inpatient Databases and complete hospital financial reporting of revenues mandated in 10 states for 2006. Study Design Hospital discharge records and hospital financial information were merged to estimate revenue per stay by payer. Estimated prices were validated against other data sources. Principal Findings Hospital prices can be reasonably estimated for 10 geographically diverse states. All-payer price-to-charge ratios, an intermediate step in estimating prices, compare favorably to cost-to-charge ratios. Estimated prices also compare well with Medicare, MarketScan private insurance, and the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey prices for major payers, given limitations of each dataset. Conclusions Public reporting of prices is a consumer resource in making decisions about health care treatment; for self-pay patients, they can provide leverage in negotiating discounts off of charges. Researchers can also use prices to increase understanding of the level and causes of price differentials among geographic areas. Prices by payer expand investigational tools available to study the interaction of inpatient hospital price setting among public and private payers - an important asset as the payer mix changes with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. © Published 2013.

This article takes a different approach-it tracks the variations in relative state progress in implementing Medicaid expansion across a continuum of activities and steps in the decision-making process. This new measure reveals wide variation not only among states that have adopted Medicaid expansion but also among those that have rejected it but have also made progress.

The purpose of this paper is to describe how the characteristics of RHCs have either changed or remained stable over a 10-year period in the past: from the late 1990s to 2007. In addition, it is also to describe some of the outstanding needs of RHCs as they navigate the transitions of U.S. health care reform. Using a panel of RHCs continuously in existence from 2006 through 2007, we calculated and compared statistics with corresponding statistics from the literature. We described the geographic distribution of RHCs, demographics of their counties of location, and characteristics of RHC structure and staffing. We also explored the implications of the recently enacted health reform law (the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act or ACA) for RHCs, and the improvements that RHCs need as it is implemented. By the end of the study period, the highest percentages of RHCs were in the South and Midwest, the percentage of RHCs in the West had grown, and that in the South had declined. RHCs served counties with increasing proportions of individuals below poverty and Hispanics/Latinos. The percentage of independent clinics had grown, as had the percentage of for profit clinics. Finally, the percentage of nurse practitioner full-time equivalents had grown as a proportion of the total for three providers. In investigating the performance of RHCs, many managerial and operational factors are not well understood. It is imperative that RHCs gather the information that could help them maximize the elements of their performance that would keep them financially stable. In addition, a broader awareness of the unique challenges that RHCs face in this era of health care reform is needed."

After Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval, surveys were sent to 1,400 randomly selected rural addresses in nine South Dakota counties. The surveys used both qualitative and quantitative means to inquire about the health usage, status and insurance status. Quantitative data were analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS), and qualitative data were analyzed for thematic content. With an overall return of 205 surveys (135 farmers), the rate of insurance was 90.6 percent. Four-fifths of farmers (80.2 percent) reported having an established provider, and 84.6 percent reported visiting a provider in the past year. Those with non-group insurance coverage were significantly more likely to report using high deductibles and limiting insurance use due to cost, but maintained a high self-reported health and preventative care use. Farmers under 50 had significantly higher rates of decreasing usage and increasing deductibles in order to afford coverage. Farmers over 65 had high health care utilization. Farmers ages 51-64 had both a high rate of using strategies to cut cost along with having an increasing utilization of care. Qualitative themes included concerns about obtaining health insurance, high deductibles and lack of coverage. The health insurance and usage among farmers is high. Farmers ages 51-64 experience increased burden due to increasing health care needs along with need for health insurance coverage. Respondent comments suggest concern with increasing rates and financial loss."

Data Sources Medicare Provider of Services data, Cost Reports, and Census data from 1991 through 2010. Study Design We examined market-level changes in entry and exit after payment reforms relative to a preexisting time trend. We also compared changes in high Medicare share markets relative to lower Medicare share markets and for freestanding relative to hospital-based facilities. Data Extraction Methods We calculated market-level entry, exit, and total stock of home health agencies, skilled nursing facilities, and inpatient rehabilitation facilities from Provider of Services files between 1992 and 2010. We linked these measures with demographic information from the Census and American Community Survey, information on Certificate of Need laws, and Medicare share of facilities in each market drawn from Cost Report data. Principal Findings Payment reforms reducing average and marginal payments reduced entries and increased exits from the market. Entry effects were larger and more persistent than exit effects. Entry and exit rates fluctuated more for home health agencies than skilled nursing facilities. Effects on number of providers were consistent with entry and exit effects. Conclusions Payment reform affects market entry and exit, which in turn may affect market structure, access to care, quality and cost of care, and patient outcomes. Policy makers should consider potential impacts of payment reforms on post-acute care market structure when implementing these reforms. © Health Research and Educational Trust."

It is essential to undertake efforts to prevent homelessness, to expand community-based services for the homeless, and to provide adequate health care for this underserved population.

Whether expanding coverage achieves this is of paramount importance as the United States prepares for the Affordable Care Act. Objectives Emergency and outpatient department use was examined after the State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) coverage expansion, focusing on adolescents (a major target group for CHIP) versus young adults (not targeted). The hypothesis was that coverage would increase use of outpatient services, and ED use would decrease. Methods Using the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) and the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS), the years 1992-1996 were analyzed as baseline and then compared to use patterns in 1999-2009, after the CHIP launch. Primary outcomes were population-adjusted annual visits to ED versus nonemergency outpatient settings. Interrupted time series were performed on use rates to ED and outpatient departments between adolescents (11 to 18 years old) and young adults (19 to 29 years old) in the pre-CHIP and CHIP periods. Outpatient-to-ED ratios were calculated and compared across time periods. A stratified analysis by payer and sex was also performed. Results The mean number of outpatient adolescent visits increased by 299 visits per 1,000 persons (95% confidence interval [CI] = 140 to 457), while there was no statistically significant increase in young adult outpatient visits across time periods. There was no statistically significant change in the mean number of adolescent ED visits across time periods, while young adult ED use increased by 48 visits per 1,000 persons (95% CI = 24 to 73). The adolescent outpatient-to-ED ratio increased by 1.0 (95% CI = 0.49 to 1.6), while the young adults ratio decreased by 0.53 across time periods (95% CI = -0.90 to -0.16). Conclusions Since CHIP, adolescent non-ED outpatient visits have increased, while ED visits have remained unchanged. In comparison to young adults, expanding insurance coverage to adolescents improved use of health care services and suggests a shift to non-ED settings. Expanding insurance through the Affordable Care Act of 2010 will likely increase use of outpatient services, but may not decrease ED volumes. © 2013 by the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine."

In accordance with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Medicare will cut payments to hospitals with high 30-day readmission rates. We retrospectively reviewed an institutional database to identify risk factors predisposing adult cardiac surgery patients to rehospitalization within 30 days of discharge. Of 2302 adult cardiac surgery patients within the study period from 2008 to 2011, a total of 218 patients (9.5%) were readmitted within 30 days. Factors found to be significant predictors of readmission were nonwhite race (P = 0.003), government health insurance (P = 0.02), ejection fraction less than 40 per cent (P = 0.001), chronic lung disease (P< 0.001), and hospital length of stay greater than 7 days (P = 0.02). Patients undergoing aortic and mitral valve operations had an increased risk of readmission compared with other cardiac operations (P < 0.001). The most common reasons for rehospitalization were pneumonia and other respiratory complications (n = 27 [12.4%]). Recognition of risk factors is crucial to reducing readmissions and improving patient care. Our data suggest that optimizing cardiopulmonary status in patients with comorbidities such as heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, increasing directed pneumonia prophylaxis, patient education tailored to specific patient social needs, earlier patient follow-up, and better communication between inpatient and outpatient physicians may reduce readmission rates. © Southeastern Surgical Congress.

Patient-centered (centric) clinical studies encourage the patient to be an integral part of study design and outcome. The patient'selectronic health record contributes to the shared national health care data set. PBRNs integrate health care data in real time at the point of care andreflect the full context of the person's health. PBRNs designed under the principles of good clinical practice (GCP) validate studies related to comparativeeffectiveness research and drug development. PBRNs can generate large amounts of data from known patient histories so that side effects can beassessed in their totality. The larger and more diverse number of patients recruited suggests that point-of-care-data, where both provider and patientparticipate in the treatment, may be more robust in that side effects, drug-drug interactions and number of concomitant medications used may beidentified earlier in the development process.

Evidence supports routine screening in clinical settings for detection and intervention. Although screening for intimate partner violence in reproductive health care settings is widely endorsed, little is known about screening practices. We conducted qualitative in-depth interviews with healthcare providers (n = 14) in several urban reproductive health clinics in Baltimore City, Maryland to understand screening practices, including related barriers and motivations. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using inductive content analysis. Findings demonstrated substantial variation in screening practices as well as related referral and follow-up, despite the existence of a screening tool. Factors that appeared to undermine consistent and successful screening implementation included lack of a common goal for screening, lack of clarity in staff roles, a gap in on-site support services, as well as lack of time and confidence. Findings affirm the value of applying a systems model to intimate partner violence (IPV) screening programs. This research advances the understanding of the implementation challenges for violence-related screening for high-risk populations such as adolescents and young adults in reproductive health care settings and is particularly relevant given the recent endorsement by the DHHS to cover IPV screening under the Affordable Care Act. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York."

Coupled with an estimated shortage of over 60,000 primary care physicians, the country's public health care system will be at a challenging crossroads, as there will be more patients waiting to see fewer doctors. Nurse practitioners (NPs) can help to ease this crisis. NPs are health care professionals with the capability to provide important and critical access to primary care, particularly for vulnerable populations. However, despite convincing data about the quality of care provided by NPs, many managed care organizations (MCOs) across the country do not credential NPs as primary care providers, limiting the ability of NPs to be reimbursed by private insurers. To assess current credentialing practices of health plans across the United States, a brief telephone survey was administered to 258 of the largest health maintenance organizations (HMOs) in the United States, operated by 98 different MCOs. Results indicated that 74% of these HMOs currently credential NPs as primary care providers. Although this represents progress over prior assessments, findings suggest that just over one fourth of major HMOs still do not recognize NPs as primary care providers. Given the documented shortage of primary care physicians in low-income communities in the United States, these credentialing policies continue to diminish the ability of NPs to deliver primary care to vulnerable populations. Furthermore, these policies could negatively impact access to care for thousands of newly insured Americans who will be seeking a primary care provider in 2014. © Copyright 2013, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2013."

Objectives: To determine the relationship between hospital nursing; that is, nurse work environment, nurse staffing levels, and nurse education, and 30-day readmissions among Medicare patients with heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, and pneumonia. Method and Design: Analysis of linked data from California, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania that included information on the organization of hospital nursing (ie, work environment, patient-to-nurse ratios, and proportion of nurses holding a BSN degree) from a survey of nurses, as well as patient discharge data, and American Hospital Association Annual Survey data. Robust logistic regression was used to estimate the relationship between nursing factors and 30-day readmission. Results: Nearly 1 quarter of heart failure index admissions [23.3% (n = 39,954)], 19.1% (n = 12,131) of myocardial infarction admissions, and 17.8% (n = 25,169) of pneumonia admissions were readmitted within 30 days. Each additional patient per nurse in the average nurse's workload was associated with a 7% higher odds of readmission for heart failure [odds ratio (OR) = 1.07; confidence interval CI, 1.05-1.09], 6% for pneumonia patients (OR = 1.06; CI, 1.03-1.09), and 9% for myocardial infarction patients (OR = 1.09; CI, 1.05-1.13). Care in a hospital with a good versus poor work environment was associated with odds of readmission that were 7% lower for heart failure (OR = 0.93; CI, 0.89-0.97), 6% lower for myocardial infarction (OR = 0.94; CI, 0.88-0.98), and 10% lower for pneumonia (OR = 0.90; CI, 0.85-0.96) patients. Conclusions: Improving nurses' work environments and staffing may be effective interventions for preventing readmissions."

The Affordable Care Act of 2010 establishes American Health Benefit Exchanges. The benefit design of insurance plans in state health insurance exchanges will be based on the structure of existing small-employer-sponsored plans. Objective. The purpose of this study was to describe the structure of the physical therapy benefit in a typical Blue Cross Blue Shield (BCBS) preferred provider organization (PPO) health insurance plan available in the individual insurance market in 2011. Design. A cross-sectional survey design was used. Methods. The physical therapy benefit within 39 BCBS PPO plans in 2011 was studied for a standard consumer with a standard budget. First, whether physical therapy was a benefit in the plan was determined. If so, then the structure of the benefit was described in terms of whether the physical therapy benefit was a stand-alone benefit or part of a combined-discipline benefit and whether a visit or financial limit was placed on the physical therapy benefit. Results. Physical therapy was included in all BCBS plans that were studied. Ninetythree percent of plans combined physical therapy with other disciplines. Two thirds of plans placed a limit on the number of visits covered. Limitations. The results of the study are limited to 1 standard consumer, 1 association of insurance companies, 1 form of insurance (a PPO), and 1 PPO plan in each of the 39 states that were studied. Conclusions. Physical therapy is a covered benefit in a typical BCBS PPO health insurance plan. Physical therapy most often is combined with other therapy disciplines, and the number of covered visits is limited in two thirds of plans. © 2013 American Physical Therapy Association."

Consumers enrolled in self-insured health plans, for which employers are financially responsible for medical claims, make up a majority of Americans with employer-sponsored health coverage. Unlike their fully insured counterparts, self-insured plans are not subject to state health insurance regulation. They are also exempt from certain provisions in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA). Employers who offer health plans can thus avoid certain insurance regulations and consumer protections by electing to self-insure. This research explores the impact of self-insurance on consumer welfare and how that is expected to change under the ACA. We describe the major consumer concerns regarding self-insurance - firm financial solvency, benefit generosity and stability, claims adjudication and recourse options - and present qualitative and quantitative evidence on their importance. We find a substantial degree of similarity between self-insured and fully insured plans with regard to benefit generosity and stability, at least with respect to available measures. In addition, we find no evidence that enrollees in self-insured plans face higher denial rates. While the ACA will not directly affect claims adjudication, it will improve recourse options for consumers with all plans and narrow the regulatory differences that existed between financing types. Policymakers must work to ensure the transparency of recourse options for enrollees in self and fully insured plans. In terms of financial solvency, while stop loss coverage is more common among smaller versus larger self-insured firms and such coverage typically commences at lower attachment points for smaller firms, roughly one-fourth of self-insured firms with fewer than 200 employees do not have such coverage. The ability of small firms without stop loss coverage to manage the risks associated with health care claims is uncertain, as are the consequences of health care expenditure-related risk for the overall financial solvency of the firm. Further, the financial security of firms who purchase stop loss coverage, and - by extension, the solvency of health plan benefits provided to employees - depends critically on the reliability of the stop loss insurer. State insurance commissioners may want to carefully consider the adequacy and appropriateness of their regulatory oversight of stop loss insurers in light of the potential move among smaller employers into the self-insured and stop loss marketplace. © 2013 Elsevier Inc."

Two days later, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (ATRA; P.L. 112-240) retroactively extended, and in certain cases modified, many of these provisions. The short time period between the expiration of these provisions and the enactment on January 2 of ATRA retroactively meant that from the perspective of all but upper-income taxpayers, income taxes remained unchanged between 2012 and 2013 (i.e., the amount of income tax withheld from their paycheck and the availability of certain tax deductions, credits, and exclusions remained unchanged). This report provides an overview of the tax provisions (Titles I-IV and Title X of P.L. 112-240) included in the ""fiscal cliff deal,"" including • the permanent extension and modification of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, often referred to collectively as the ""Bush-era tax cuts"" • the temporary extension of certain tax provisions originally included as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA; P.L. 111-5), often referred to as the ""2009 tax cuts"" • the permanent extension of the alternative minimum tax (AMT) patch; • the temporary extension of a variety of other temporary expiring provisions for individuals, businesses, and energy often referred to as ""tax extenders"" and • the expansion of in-plan conversions of traditional employersponsored retirement accounts (like 401(k) plans) to employersponsored Roth accounts (like Roth 401(k) plans). ATRA did not extend the payroll tax cut. The payroll tax cut-temporarily enacted for 2011 and 2012-reduced Social Security taxes from 6.2% to 4.2% for employees and from 12.4% to 10.4% for the self-employed on the first $110,100 of wages in 2012. In addition, P.L. 112-240 did not change another component of the fiscal cliff, namely new taxes primarily related to Medicare and enacted as part of the Affordable Care Act (ACA; P.L. 111-148, as amended), which went into effect at the beginning of 2013. The Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) estimates that the tax provisions of ATRA (Titles I-IV and Title X) would reduce revenues by $3.9 trillion over the 10-year budgetary window from 2013 to 2022 in comparison to the official current law baseline. (The official current law baseline was an estimate of future revenue if all temporary tax provisions had expired as originally scheduled.) Of this $3.9 trillion, $1.5 trillion (39%) is a result of permanently extending certain income tax provisions of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, $369.1 billion (9%) is a result of permanently extending and modifying estate tax provisions, $134.2 billion (3%) is a result of temporarily extending 2009 tax cut provisions, $1.8 trillion (46%) is a result of permanently extending the AMT patch, and $76.3 billion (2%) is a result of temporarily extending certain temporary expiring provisions and ""tax extenders."" In contrast, using a current policy baseline which estimates future revenues if all temporary tax provisions (excluding the payroll tax cut) had been extended, the Administration has stated that these tax provisions would raise revenues by $618 billion. ATRA includes other non-tax provisions, including those related to budget sequestration, emergency unemployment benefits, and Medicare.

Concern over these large deficits, as well as the long-term trajectory of the federal budget, resulted in significant debate during the 112th Congress over how to achieve meaningful deficit reduction and how to implement a plan to stabilize the federal debt. Numerous expiring provisions, across-the-board spending cuts, and other short-term considerations having a major budgetary impact, were scheduled to take effect at the very end of 2012 or in early 2013. This combination of policies, estimated by CBO to reduce the deficit by $502 billion between FY2012 and FY2013, was referred to by some as the ""fiscal cliff."" Had these policies taken effect, CBO projected that the economy would have returned to recession in FY2013. On January 2, 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (ATRA; H.R. 8 as enacted), which addressed many of these tax and spending policies. As Congress changed the trajectory of these policies by increasing spending and decreasing revenue, these policies have increased the deficit relative to the current law baseline. The provisions of ATRA were estimated by CBO to increase the budget deficit by $330 billion in FY2013 and nearly $4 trillion over the FY2013-FY2022 period. ATRA addressed several revenue provisions that had been set to expire at the end of 2012. These included the ""Bush-era tax cuts,"" provisions related to the estate tax, certain tax provisions enacted or expanded as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT), and a number of temporary tax provisions (also known as ""tax extenders""). ATRA permanently extended a modified version of the ""Bush-era tax cuts"" and the estate tax, as well as a permanent AMT patch. The law also temporarily extended the ARRA tax provisions and a variety of ""tax extenders."" ATRA did not extend the two-percentage-point reduction in the Social Security payroll tax, which expired at the end of 2012, or delay the Affordable Care Act (ACA) taxes on higher-income tax filers, which are scheduled to take effect in 2013. Combined, these provisions were estimated by CBO and JCT to increase the deficit by $280 billion in FY2013 and $3.93 trillion over the FY2013-FY2022 period. In addition to these revenue provisions, ATRA also addressed several spending policies that were scheduled to reduce spending beginning in FY2013. It extended the federal share of extended benefit payments for unemployment and postponed the expiration of the authorization for temporary emergency unemployment benefits through 2013. It delayed a reduction in payments to Medicare physicians under the Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) system through 2013. It eliminated the first two months of the automatic spending cuts enacted as part of the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA; P.L. 112-25), postponing their onset from January 2 to March 1. It extended the 2008 farm bill through 2013. These provisions, some of which were offset, were estimated by CBO to increase the deficit by $48 billion in FY2013 and $34 billion over the FY2013-FY2022 period. Despite the enactment of ATRA, many policy issues affecting the federal budget remain unresolved. Specifically, in early 2013, Congress will likely consider a debt limit increase, additional actions related to the postponed BCA automatic spending reductions, and appropriations for the final six months of FY2013. Finally, long-term fiscal sustainability issues remain unresolved. In the context of large budget deficits, Congress was faced with a variety of policies that were set to reduce spending and increase revenues at the end of 2012, referred to by some as the ""fiscal cliff."" Had these policies taken effect, CBO projected that the ensuing fiscal contraction would have resulted in a recession in 2013. On January 2, 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (ATRA; H.R. 8 as enacted), which prevented many-but not all-of the fiscal cliff policies from going into effect. Budget issues are likely to continue into the 113th Congress surrounding two issues that the ATRA did not resolve. First, financing of the federal budget for the last six months of the fiscal year is unresolved because of uncertainties associated with the debt limit and appropriations. More specifically, the continuing resolution to fund the federal government, enacted in September, runs out at the end of March and current fiscal policy would require an increase to the debt limit in early 2013 to meet existing obligations. Second, the federal debt remains on an unsustainable path in the long-term because of the imbalance between spending and revenues.1 This report provides a brief overview of the major tax and spending policies that comprised the ""fiscal cliff.""

Second, it reinstituted automatic entitlement to benefits for certain eligible survivors of coal miners whose lifetime benefit claims were awarded because they were totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis. These regulations clarify how the statutory presumption may be invoked and rebutted and the application and scope of the survivor-entitlement provision.

However, few studies have identified and described what factors contribute to delays that might result in patient harm in the outpatient setting. We analyzed 111 root cause analysis reports that investigated such delays and were submitted to the Veterans Affairs National Center for Patient Safety in the period 2005-12. The most common contributing factors noted in the reports included coordination problems resulting from inadequate follow-up planning, delayed scheduling for unspecified reasons, inadequate tracking of test results, and the absence of a system to track patients in need of shortterm follow-up. Other contributing factors were team-level decisionmaking problems resulting from miscommunication of urgency between providers and providers' lack of awareness of or knowledge about a patient's situation; and communication failures among providers, patients, an other health care team members. Our findings suggest that to support care goals in the Affordable Care Act and the National Quality Strategy, even relatively sophisticated electronic health record systems will require enhancements.

There is concern that high-deductible health plans might cause enrollees of low socioeconomic status to forgo emergency care as a result of burdensome out-of-pocket costs. We analyzed emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations over two years among enrollees insured in highdeductible plans through small employers in Massachusetts. We found that plan members of low socioeconomic status experienced 25-30 percent reductions in high-severity ED visits over both years, while hospitalizations declined by 23 percent in year 1 but rose again in year 2. Similar trends were not found among high-deductible plan members of high socioeconomic status. Our findings suggest that plan members of low socioeconomic status at small firms responded inappropriately to high-deductible plans and that initial reductions in high-severity ED visits might have increased the need for subsequent hospitalizations.

Most of these policies include language that allows providers to opt out of the requirement because of religious or moral beliefs-conscience clause exemptions. There is striking variation in how these exemptions are defined. This article investigates the sources and consequences of ambiguous versus precise statutory language in conscience clauses.We find that some forms of political and institutional fragmentation (party polarization and gubernatorial appointment power) are correlated with the degree of policy specificity in state contraceptive mandates. This finding reinforces previous law and policy scholarship that has shown that greater fragmentation promotes ambiguous statutory language because broad wording acts as a vehicle for compromisewhen actors disagree. Interestingly, it is the more precisely worded statutes that have prompted court battles. We explain this with reference to the asymmetry of incentives and mobilizing costs between those disadvantaged by broad (primarily female employees) versus precisely worded statutes (primarily Catholic organizations). Our findings suggest that the impact of statutory ambiguity on court intervention is heavily contextualized by the resources and organization of affected stakeholders. © 2013 by Duke University Press."

This is largely because of regulatory constraints and pervasive suboptimal clinical practices. Fewer than 10 percent of all people dependent on opioids in the United States are receiving substitution treatment, although the proportion may increase with expanded health insurance coverage as a result of the Affordable Care Act. In light of the accumulated evidence, we recommend eliminating restrictions on office-based methadone prescribing in the United States; reducing financial barriers to treatment, such as varying levels of copayment in Canada and the United States; reducing reliance on less effective and potentially unsafe opioid detoxification; and evaluating and creating mechanisms to integrate emerging treatments.

As such, hospitals across the country have been trying to identify and implement successful strategies for reducing hospitalizations. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of a combined pharmacist and social worker program on reducing 30-day, all-cause readmission rates to the same hospital. METHODS: Our study design was a retrospective, cross-sectional study that included 100 inpatients discharged from a large academic medical center. Fifty patients were enrolled in the combined pharmacist and social worker program, and 50 received usual care; all were deemed high risk for readmission due to clinical or social factors. In the program group, a phar- macist performed a thorough medication history and review of discharge medications and, in some cases, communicated with the patient after discharge. The program group was also followed by a social worker team in the hospital and after discharge; as necessary, psychosocial interventions were performed. RESULTS: The 2 patient cohorts had similar demographic and clinical char- acteristics. Ten percent of patients enrolled in the combined pharmacist and social worker program were readmitted to the hospital for any reason within 30 days of discharge, compared with 30% of patients in the usual care group (P = 0.012). CONCLUSION: The combined pharmacist and social worker program dem- onstrated a significant reduction in 30-day, all-cause readmission rates to the same hospital. © 2013, Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy."

While several hospital to home transitional care models demonstrated a reduction in readmissions and cost savings, programs adapted to population needs and existing resources was essential. Methods. Focusing on process and outcomes evaluation, a retrospective analysis of a modified community based care transitions program was conducted. Results: In addition to high levels of patient satisfaction with the care transitions program, participants' confidence with self care was significantly improved. Further, the program evaluation demonstrated a 73% reduction in readmissions and an actual Medicare cost savings during the 9-month study period of $214,192, excluding the cost to administer the program. Conclusions: While there are several transitional care programs in existence, a customized approach is desirable and often required as the most cost effective way to manage care transitions and employ evidence based policy making. This study established some of the pitfalls when implementing a community-based transitional care program and demonstrated encouraging outcomes. © 2013 Logue and Drago; licensee BioMed Central Ltd."

I employ a ten-year sample of market-level financial data and quality variables for Texas insurers, as well as relevant control variables, in regression analyses that utilize insurer and market fixed effects. Of the 15 quality measures, only one has a statistically significant relationship with the MLR. For this measure, the relationship is negative.

Advocates of personal liberty are often critical, particularly in the USA, of public health measures which they deem to be overly restrictive of personal choice. In addition to the alleged restrictions of individual freedom of choice when it comes to the question of whether or not to purchase health insurance, opponents to the PPACA also argue that certain requirements of the Act violate the right to freedom of conscience by mandating support for services deemed immoral by religious groups. These issues continue the long running debate surrounding the demands of religious groups for special consideration in the realm of health care provision. In this paper I examine the requirements of the PPACA, and the impacts that religious, and other ideological, exemptions can have on public health, and argue that the exemptions provided for by the PPACA do not in fact impose unreasonable restrictions on religious freedom, but rather concede too much and in so doing endanger public health and some important individual liberties. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York."

We explored childhood cancer survivors' familiarity with and opinion of the ACA to understand how survivors' insurance coverage may be affected. Materials and Methods: From April to July 2012 we conducted in-depth, semistructured telephone interviews with 53 adult survivors recruited from the Utah Cancer SEER Registry. Participants were randomly selected from sex, age, and rural/ urban strata and were younger than 21 years at time of diagnosis. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed with NVivo 9 by two coders (kappa = 0.94). We report on the 49 participants who had heard of the ACA. Results: Most survivors were unaware of ACA provisions beyond the insurance mandate. Few knew about coverage for children up to age 26 or pre-existing insurance options. Although one third believed the ACA could potentially benefit them via expanded insurance coverage, many were concerned that the ACA would lead to rising health care costs and decreasing quality of care. Survivors had concerns specific to their cancer history, including fears of future health care rationing if they developed subsequent health problems. Conclusion: Childhood cancer survivors have a low level of familiarity with the ACA and are unaware of how it may affect them given their cancer history.

Information regarding this population is vital to physicians as they prepare for more patients with coverage. Our objective was to describe demographic and health characteristics of potentially eligible Medicaid beneficiaries. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional study using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2007-2010) to identify and compare adult US citizens potentially eligible for Medicaid under provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) with current adult Medicaid beneficiaries. We compared demographic characteristics (age, sex, race/ethnicity, education) and health measures (self-reported health status; measured body mass index, hemoglobin A1c level, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, depression screen [9-item Patient Health Questionnaire], tobacco smoking, and alcohol use). Results: Analyses were based on an estimated 13.8 million current adult nonelderly Medicaid beneficiaries and 13.6 million nonelderly adults potentially eligible for Medicaid. Potentially eligible individuals are expected to be more likely male (49.2% potentially eligible vs 33.3% current beneficiaries; P <.001), to be more likely white and less likely black (58.8% white, 20.0% black vs 49.9% white, 25.2% black; P =.02), and to be statistically indistinguishable in terms of educational attainment. Overall, potentially eligible adults are expected to have better health status (34.8% ""excellent"" or ""very good,"" 40.4% ""good"") than current beneficiaries (33.5% ""excellent"" or ""very good,"" 31.6% ""good""; P <.001). The proportions obese (34.5% vs 42.9%; P =.008) and with depression (15.5% vs 22.3%; P =.003) among potentially eligible individuals are significantly lower than those for current beneficiaries, while there are no significant differences in the expected prevalence of diabetes or hypertension. Current tobacco smoking (49.2% vs 38.0%; P =.002), and moderate and heavier alcohol use (21.6% vs 16.0% and 16.5% vs 9.8%; P <.001, respectively) are more common among the potentially eligible population than among current beneficiaries. Conclusions: Under the ACA, physicians can anticipate a potentially eligible Medicaid population with equal if not better current health status and lower prevalence of obesity and depression than current Medicaid beneficiaries. Federal Medicaid expenditures for newly covered beneficiaries therefore may not be as high as anticipated in the short term. Given the higher prevalence of tobacco smoking and alcohol use, however, broad enrollment and engagement of this potentially eligible population is needed to address their higher prevalence of modifiable risk factors for future chronic disease."

This tendency to fall beneath the radar is clear in the realm of health policy, especially in the area of insurance coverage. This article provides an initial assessment of the potential impact of health reform on the US Virgin Islands (USVI) and, in light of this assessment, considers how the results of a USVI household survey conducted in 2003 and 2009 might be used as a baseline for future monitoring of the impact of national reform. METHODS: A study by the Virgin Island's Bureau of Economic Research, Office of the Governor, and the University of Minnesota, was conducted in 2003 and 2009. The Virgin Islands Health Insurance telephone Surveys were random digit dial landline telephone surveys of households in the USVI. A stratified sample was drawn to produce precise estimates of insurance coverage for the USVI as a whole and for the 3 islands separately. RESULTS: Almost one-third of the residents (28.7%) in the Virgin Islands were uninsured in 2009. This rate is twice the US average (15.4%) and significantly higher than the uninsured rate of 24.1% when a similar survey was last conducted the Virgin Islands in 2003. CONCLUSIONS: The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 provides special funding to the territories through a mix of increased Medicaid caps for each territory and the provision of premium subsidies through newly established health insurance exchanges to low-income populations. However, the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansions to newly eligible adults - primarily adults without children - are limited to current eligibility levels in the territories, which is $5,500 in annual income for adult coverage in the USVI. Within these abbreviated parameters, the Medicaid expansion can go so far only toward mitigating uninsurance among the lowest income groups in the territories. With certain low-income childless adults overlooked, the Affordable Care Act does not fully address the high need for affordable health insurance coverage in the territories.

These 11 hospitals (which are paid fee-for-service rather than on a DRG system) began reporting measures (2 general safety, 2 breast, 1 colon) in 2013. Given this reporting mandate, we set out to determine whether the PPS-exempt gynecologic oncology programs could identify quality measures specific to the care of our patients. Methods A list of 12 quality measures specific to gynecologic oncology was created (from sources including the National Quality Forum and the SGO). Measures already in use were not included. The list was ranked by the gynecologic oncology program directors at the PPS-exempt hospitals. Descriptive statistics (including mean and SD for rankings) were utilized. Results Despite mandatory reporting of quality measures for PPS-exempt cancer hospitals, little consensus exists regarding specific gynecologic cancer measures. Documentation of debulking status, cancer survival, and offering minimally invasive surgery (for endometrial cancer) and intraperitoneal chemotherapy (for ovarian cancer) are important, but with widely variable responses (when ranked 1-12, standard deviations are 2-3). General issues regarding adherence to guidelines for the use of GCSF, documentation of functional status, and tracking of patient satisfaction scores were ranked the lowest. Three of the directors reported that their compensation is partially linked to quality outcomes. Conclusions There is wide variability in ranking of quality measures, and may relate to provider or institutional factors.

They epitomize the evidence-based movement, which recognizes that mere ""clinical judgment"" is often inadequate to synthesize all the important data to determine the best management for a particular patient. This movement has at its core the fundamental expectation that medical decisions be based on sound data rather than anecdote. Unfortunately, this concept rarely manifests in daily practices where significant variations in care still exist. Guidelines were designed to improve patient care, reduce unnecessary variation, and reduce attributed costs. Therefore, it is not surprising that associated recommendations are now being incorporated into health care legislation as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.

Objectives: This objective of this study is to examine organizational policies on worksite lactation support as they relate to the new federal standards in state employees and within large state public and private universities. Methods: State laws were collected from National Conference of State Legislators. Policies for state employees and large public and private universities were collected via human resource or personnel administration websites. The policies were coded for content and compared to FLSA requirements. The presence of state law on lactation support and extent to which the organizational policies encompass FSLA were compared with state breastfeeding rates at 6 months. Results: After the ACA became effective in 2010, 33 state organizations, 36 state public universities, and 13 private universities issued the administrative notice and aligned their organizational policies with the federal requirements. Twenty-four states enacted worksite breastfeeding law prior to the 2010 federal law. Nineteen states with enacted worksite breastfeeding state laws also have lactation policies for state employees. Conclusion: States and universities vary in the presence of a formal, written lactation support policy for state employees. There was a significant correlation between State law and 6 months exclusive breastfeeding rates. Future research should investigate whether the federal law serves as stronger catalyst for organizational policies than does state law. Additionally, other policies such as paid maternity leave may also contribute to achieving the desired breastfeeding rates. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc."

Less is known about underinsurance among low-income adults, particularly those with public insurance. OBJECTIVE: To compare rates of underinsurance among low-income adults with private versus public insurance, and to identify predictors of being underinsured. DESIGN: Descriptive and multivariate analysis of data from the 2005-2008 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. PARTICIPANTS: Adults 19-64 years of age with family income less than 125 % of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) and full-year continuous coverage in one of four mutually exclusive insurance categories (N = 5,739): private insurance, Medicaid, Medicare, and combined Medicaid/Medicare coverage. MAIN MEASURES: Prevalence of underinsurance among low-income adults, defined as out-of-pocket expenditures greater than 5 % of household income, delays/failure to obtain necessary medical care due to cost, or delays/failure to obtain necessary prescription medications due to cost. KEY RESULTS: Criteria for underinsurance were met by 34.5 % of low-income adults. Unadjusted rates of underinsurance were 37.7 % in private coverage, 26.0 % in Medicaid, 65.1 % in Medicare, and 45.1 % among Medicaid/Medicare dual enrollees. Among underinsured adults, household income averaged $6,181 and out-of-pocket spending averaged $1,115. Due to cost, 8.1 % and 12.8 % deferred or delayed obtaining medical care or prescription medications, respectively. Predictors of underinsurance included being White, unemployed, and in poor health. After multivariate adjustment, Medicaid recipients were significantly less likely to be underinsured than privately insured adults (OR 0.22, 95 % CI 0.17-0.28). CONCLUSIONS: Greater than one-third of low-income adults nationally were underinsured. Medicaid recipients were less likely to be underinsured than privately insured adults, indicating potential benefits of expanded Medicaid under health care reform. Nonetheless, more than one-quarter of Medicaid recipients were underinsured, highlighting the importance of addressing cost-related barriers to care even among those with public coverage. © 2013 Society of General Internal Medicine."

Quality measures currently used or proposed for these new health reform-related programs addressing care coordination primarily capture continuity of care. Other key areas of care coordination, such as care transitions, patient-centeredness, and cross-cutting care across multiple conditions are infrequently addressed. The lack of a comprehensive and consistent measure set for care coordination will pose challenges for healthcare providers and policy makers who seek, respectively, to provide and reward well-coordinated care.

Starting in 2014, some states will extend Medicaid to thousands of previously uninsured, low-income women. Given this changing landscape, it is important to have a baseline of current levels of Medicaid financing for births in each state. This article aims to 1) provide up-to-date, multiyear data for all states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico and 2) summarize issues of data comparability in view of increased interest in program performance and impact assessment. Methods: We collected 2008-2010 data on Medicaid births from individual state contacts during the winter of 2012-2013, systematically documenting sources and challenges. Findings: In 2010, Medicaid financed 48% of all births, an increase of 19% in the proportion of all births covered by Medicaid in 2008. Percentages varied among states. Numerous data challenges were found. Conclusions/Implications for Research and Policy: Consistent adoption of the 2003 birth certificate in all states would allow the National Center for Health Statistics Natality Detail dataset to serve as a nationally representative source of data for the financing of births in the United States. As states expand coverage to low-income women, women of childbearing age will be able to obtain coverage before and between pregnancies, allowing for access to services that could improve their overall and reproductive health, as well as birth outcomes. Improved birth outcomes could translate into substantial cost savings, because the costs associated with preterm births are estimated to be 10 times greater than those for full-term births. © 2013 Jacobs Institute of Women's Health."

Without enough good risks to offset older and sicker people who are likely to jump at the opportunity to gain more-affordable coverage, the exchanges risk significant adverse selection--attracting a sicker-than-average population--that will drive up premiums. Key to persuading younger and healthier uninsured people to opt for cover-age will be convincing them that health insurance is a good deal, according to a new national study by the Center for Studying Health System Change (HSC). While most uninsured people believe health insurance is important, far fewer now believe coverage is affordable and worth the cost. However, new federal subsidies for lower-to-middle-income people may change the calculus of whether coverage is affordable. While uninsured people who are younger, have few or no health prob-lems, and are self-described risk-takers are more likely to believe they can go without health insurance, even a majority of these so-called young invincibles believe health insurance is important. The findings indicate that most uninsured people are not inherently resistant to the idea of having health insurance.

A lack of insurance is associated with premature death from preventable causes.

The magnitude and complexity of the US ""uninsurance"" problem, as well as recent federal initiatives to expand coverage options, inspire important questions: Can medical homes play a more active role in helping patients find and keep insurance coverage? How can basic tenets from the chronic care model be operationalized to build systems to treat the uninsurance ailment? Creating effective processes and tools within the medical home to keep a patient insured may be as important to improving population health as helping a patient maintain a normal blood pressure.

For behavioral health practitioners, IBH requires a shift to a brief, outcome-driven, and team-based model of care. Despite the fact that social workers comprise the majority of behavioral health providers in IBH settings, little research has been done to assess the extent to which social workers are prepared for effective practice in fast-paced primary care.

Medicaid patients have previously been noted to be at an increased risk for impaired access to health care, delayed medical treatment, and the receipt of substandard care. Conversely, those with commercial insurance may be subject to overtreatment. The goal of this study was to evaluate how Medicaid versus commercial insurance status affects outcomes following spinal cord stimulation (SCS) surgery. Materials and Methods A retrospective cohort study of 13,774 patients underwent either percutaneous or paddle permanent SCS implantation, selected from the Thomson Reuter's MarketScan database between 2000 and 2009. Patients were characterized by age at initial procedure, gender, baseline comorbidity burden, procedure-associated diagnosis code, follow-up, and type of insurance (Medicaid vs. commercial insurance). Outcome measures included probability of reoperation, timing and type of reoperation, presence of postoperative complications (immediate, 30 days, and 90 days), and overall utilization of health resources postoperatively. Multivariate analysis was performed comparing the relative effect of insurance status on outcomes following initial surgery. Results Medicaid patients had greater healthcare resource utilization as measured by medications prescribed, emergency department visits, and length of stay; however, commercially insured patients had significantly higher overall costs ($110,908 vs. $64,644, p < 0.0001). Commercial and Medicaid patients did not significantly differ in their complication rates during the index hospitalization or at 30 days or 90 days postoperatively. The group were also not significantly different in their two-year reoperation rates (7.32% vs. 5.06%, p = 0.0513). Conclusions There are substantial insurance disparities that affect healthcare utilization and overall cost following SCS.

A firmly rooted moral compass inspires, leads, guides, and provides a solid foundation--and some sense of security--for organizations navigating massive or significant transformational changes, such as those required by the Affordable Care Act. In addition, ""smaller"" changes, such as consolidation, rationalization, and relocation of services, have a strong chance of succeeding in organizations that operate within a moral framework from which the organization can shape its future strategies and make important decisions. Finally, an organization's moral compass guides actions, reactions, and behaviors when unexpected or devastating events occur in the lives of consumers, employees, physicians, business partners, patients, families, and members of the community. The direction toward which its moral compass is pointing determines the types and quality of relationships it has with those key stakeholders, and those individuals and groups come to depend on what they have observed and know to be true about how the organization behaves in certain circumstances. While no organization can predict the future and all of the implications of change, key stakeholder groups need and want to know how they will be treated in the face of such change-whether expected or unexpected. In this sense, every organization must establish ways to evaluate the validity of its moral compass and develop--and adhere to--guidelines that determine how its members will behave, whether in ordinary circumstances; in the face of extraordinary, high-impact situations; or in times of massive transformational change. Above all, executive leaders must always be mindful that their own personal moral compass becomes their organization's moral compass."

Despite federal spending slowing in the past 2 years, the Board of Medicare Trustees believes that cost savings are only achievable if health care providers are able to realize productivity improvements at a quicker pace than experienced historically. Consequently, the re-engineering of U.S. health care and bridging of the divide between health and health care have been proposed beyond affordable care. Thus, the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) envisions alignment of Medicare payment systems to eliminate variable rates for the same ambulatory services provided to similar patients in different settings, such as the physician's office, hospital outpatient departments (HOPDs), and ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs). MedPAC believes that if the same service can be safely provided in different settings, a prudent purchaser should not pay more for that service in one setting than in another. MedPAC is also concerned that payment variations across settings encourage arrangements among providers that result in care being provided in high paid settings. MedPAC recommends that payment rates be based on the resources needed to treat patients in the most efficient setting, adjusting for differences in patient severity, to the extent the severity differences affect costs. MedPAC has analyzed the costs of evaluation and management (E&M) services and the differences between providing them in a HOPD setting compared to a physician office setting, echocardiography services, and multiple services provided in ASCs and HOPDs. MedPAC has shown that for an established patient office visit (CPT 99213) provided in a free-standing physician's office, the program pays the physician 70% less than in HOPD setting with a payment for physician practice of $72.50 versus $123.38 for HOPD setting. Similarly, for a Level II echocardiogram, HOPD costs 141% more for the same service than a free-standing office ($188.31 versus $452.89). For interventional techniques, Medicare payments vary from physician office to HOPD setting, with $211.96 in an office setting, $407.28 in ASC setting, and $655.62 in HOPD for procedures such as epidural injections. The MedPAC proposal for changing HOPD payment rates for services would reduce program spending and result in beneficiary cost sharing by $900 million in one year. On average, hospitals' overall Medicare revenue will decline by 0.6% and HOPD revenue would fall by 2.7%. Further, MedPAC provided a specific example that aligning payment rates between HOPDs and freestanding offices only for cardiac imaging services would reduce program spending and beneficiary cost sharing by $500 million in one year. In estimating the savings that would be realized by equalizing payment rates between HOPDs and ASCs for certain ambulatory surgical procedures, MedPAC have shown potential Medicare program spending and beneficiary cost savings to be about $590 million per year. The impact of the proposed policies that are discussed in this manuscript would result in savings of approximately $1.5 billion per year for Medicare. MedPAC also has recommended a stop-loss policy that would limit the loss of Medicare revenue for those hospitals."

Unfortunately, it is not. Consumers see $4 billion of direct-to-consumer advertising annually, which typically fails to present data about how well drugs work. The professional label - the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) mechanism to get physicians information needed for appropriate prescribing - may also fail to present benefit data. FDA labeling guidance, in fact, suggests that industry omit benefit data for new drugs in an existing class and for drugs approved on the basis of unfamiliar outcomes (such as depression rating scales). The medical literature is also problematic: there is selective reporting of favorable trials, favorable outcomes within trials, and ""spinning"" unfavorable results to maximize benefit and minimize harm. In contrast, publicly available FDA reviews always include the phase 3 trial data on benefit and harm, which are the basis of drug approval. However, these reviews are practically inaccessible: lengthy, poorly organized, and weakly summarized. To improve accessibility, we developed the Drug Facts Box: a one-page summary of benefit and harm data for each indication of a drug. A series of studies - including national randomized trials - demonstrates that most consumers understand the Drug Facts Box and that it improves decision-making. Despite calls from their own Risk Communication Advisory Committee and Congress (in the Affordable Care Act) to consider implementing boxes, the FDA announced it needs at least 3-5 y more to make a decision. Given its potential public health impact, physicians and the public should not have to wait that long for better drug information."

Our objective is to estimate how many new GO patients may lose access to care if the state forgoes Medicaid expansion. Methods New patients referred to the GO service between July 1, 2010 and July 1, 2012 were identified. Data were collected regarding age, race, referral diagnosis, payor, and state pay scale. Pay scale 1 (PS1) is equal to the federal poverty level (FPL). Assumptions included the following: (1) pay scale is a surrogate for income, (2) PS1 patients will be ineligible for discounted insurance through the exchanges, and (3) decreasing DSH funds will result in a reduction of the free-care pool. Results There were 1623 referrals to the GO service and the majority (83%) was Caucasian. The payor distribution was 44% commercial insurance, 5.6% Medicaid, 31% Medicare, and 10.4% uninsured. Among the 361 women who were PS1, 32% were uninsured. Thirty percent of PS1 patients were minorities and 47.4% had a malignancy. Of note, 52% of new patients with cervical cancer were PS1. Conclusion Seven percent of new GO patients are PS1 and uninsured. This population contains a disproportionate number of minorities and women with cancer. These women will have difficulty affording care as DSH funding decreases, particularly in states with lean Medicaid that opt out of Medicaid expansion. The burden of lack of access to care will be shouldered by an unfortunate few. © 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

In 2009, the number of nonelderly persons with individual coverage ranged from 9.55 million in the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey to 25.3 million in the American Community Survey. Notable differences also exist between survey estimates and National Association of Insurance Commissioners administrative counts, an outcome likely driven by variation in the type and measurement of individual coverage considered by surveys relative to administrative data. Future research evaluating the impact of the Affordable Care Act coverage provisions must be mindful of differences across surveys and administrative sources as it relates to the measurement of individual market coverage. © The Author(s) 2013."

We identified those readmitted within 90 days of surgery and analyzed 87 random de-identified medical records. We then assigned a clinical diagnosis for each readmission, which was then compared with the coder-derived diagnosis by ICD-9 code. The overall 90-day readmission rate was 7.9%. We identified 22 of 87 patients for whom there was disagreement (25.3%, 95% CI = 16.6-35.8%). The most common were procedure-related complications.

Despite these advances, thousands of women continue to be diagnosed with and die of this highly preventable disease each year. This paper describes the initiatives and recommendations of national cervical cancer experts toward preventing and possibly eliminating this disease. Methods: In May 2011, Cervical Cancer-Free America, a national initiative, convened a cervical cancer summit in Washington, DC. Over 120 experts from the public and private sector met to develop a national agenda for reducing cervical cancer morbidity and mortality in the USA. Results: Summit participants evaluated four broad challenges to reducing cervical cancer: (1) low use of HPV vaccines, (2) low use of cervical cancer screening, (3) screening errors, and (4) lack of continuity of care for women diagnosed with cervical cancer. The summit offered 12 concrete recommendations to guide future national and local efforts toward this goal. Conclusions: Cervical cancer incidence and mortality can be greatly reduced by better deploying existing methods and systems. The challenge lies in ensuring that the array of available prevention options are accessible and utilized by all age-appropriate women - particularly minority and underserved women who are disproportionately affected by this disease. The consensus was that cervical cancer can be greatly reduced and that prevention efforts can lead the way towards a dramatic reduction in this preventable disease in our country. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht."

As such, strategies to decrease HFR are avidly sought and studied. There are many reasons for HFR that challenge programs aimed to reduce the frequency of HFR. Large pharmacological and device trials often incorporate hospital admission as an endpoint, and many programs have been developed in varied settings to address HFR. Some of the most successful programs use a multidisciplinary team approach, intensive patient education and system commitment. Many risk factors for HFR have been identified although prediction tools are limited. The reduction of HFR should incorporate a multidisciplinary approach with 1) evidenced-based physician-guided medical and device therapy; 2) institutional programs for effective care transitions; 3) strategies aimed to improve disease management; and 4) engage patients in self-care. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York."

The new United States healthcare reform law has created provisions for financial penalties for hospitals with higher than expected 30-day all-cause readmission rates for hospitalized Medicare beneficiaries aged ≥65 years with heart failure. We examined the effect of digoxin on 30-day all-cause hospital admission in older patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction. Methods: In the main Digitalis Investigation Group trial, 6800 ambulatory patients with chronic heart failure (ejection fraction ≤45%) were randomly assigned to digoxin or placebo. Of these, 3405 were aged ≥65 years (mean age, 72 years; 25% were women; 11% were nonwhite). The main outcome in the current analysis was 30-day all-cause hospital admission. Results: In the first 30 days after randomization, all-cause hospitalization occurred in 5.4% (92/1693) and 8.1% (139/1712) of patients in the digoxin and placebo groups, respectively, (hazard ratio {HR} when digoxin was compared with placebo, 0.66; 95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.51-0.86; P =.002). Digoxin also reduced both 30-day cardiovascular (3.5% vs 6.5%; HR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.38-0.72; P <.001) and heart failure (1.7 vs 4.2%; HR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.26-0.62; P <.001) hospitalizations, with similar trends for 30-day all-cause mortality (0.7% vs 1.3%; HR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.27-1.11; P =.096). Younger patients were at lower risk of events but obtained similar benefits from digoxin. Conclusions: Digoxin reduces 30-day all-cause hospital admission in ambulatory older patients with chronic systolic heart failure.

To simultaneously examine the geospatial patterns of service delivery and location of community health centers, the geographic information system shape files of local health department jurisdictions were used to examine prenatal care services. Additionally, the effect of service availability was examined by analyzing the rate of low birth weight births within the service areas of these facilities. Results show large variation in the distribution of community health centers. Additionally, the analysis of local health department services shows that prenatal care services are not available in every jurisdiction. Furthermore, the rates of low birth weight births in these areas are significantly higher than in areas where prenatal care is available.

Methods: This article addresses health care access for immigrant workers in the AgFF Sector, and the workforce providing care to these workers. Contents: Immigrant workers bear a disproportionate burden of poverty and ill health and additionally face significant occupational hazards. AgFF laborers largely are uninsured, ineligible for benefits, and unable to afford health services. The new Affordable Care Act will likely not benefit such individuals. Community and Migrant Health Centers (C/MHCs) are the frontline of health care access for immigrant AgFF workers. C/MHCs offer discounted health services that are tailored to meet the special needs of their underserved clientele. C/MHCs struggle, however, with a shortage of primary care providers and staff prepared to treat occupational illness and injury among AgFF workers. A number of programs across the US aim to increase the number of primary care physicians and care givers trained in occupational health at C/MHCs. While such programs are beneficial, substantial action is needed at the national level to strengthen and expand the C/MHC system and to establish widely Medical Home models and Accountable Care Organizations.

Data Sources/Study Setting 2001-2009 nursing home Minimum Data Set and Online Survey, Certification, and Reporting (OSCAR) datasets. Study Design Between 2001 and 2009, eight state Medicaid agencies adopted P4P programs in nursing homes. We use a difference-in- differences approach to test for changes in nursing home quality under P4P, taking advantage of the variation in timing of implementation across these eight states and using nursing homes in the 42 non-P4P states plus Washington, DC as contemporaneous controls. Principal Findings Quality improvement under P4P was inconsistent. While three clinical quality measures (the percent of residents being physically restrained, in moderate to severe pain, and developed pressure sores) improved with the implementation of P4P in states with P4P compared with states without P4P, other targeted quality measures either did not change or worsened. Of the two structural measures of quality that were tied to payment (total number of deficiencies and nurse staffing) deficiency rates worsened slightly under P4P while staffing levels did not change. Conclusions Medicaid-based P4P in nursing homes did not result in consistent improvements in nursing home quality.

Most private insurance plans, Medicare, and Medicaid expansion programs are required to cover US Preventive Services Task Force A- and B-rated services without cost sharing. However, because the Affordable Care Act treats newly eligible and existing Medicaid beneficiaries differently, all adult Medicaid beneficiaries within a state might not be eligible for the same preventive services. This study reviewed Medicaid programs across the country and found that most states do not cover all of these recommended services as preventive measures for adults. As a result, existing adult Medicaid beneficiaries might not have coverage of the same important preventive services that most other insured people have. In addition, aspects of how preventive services are defined in many states result in confusion about coverage parameters, potentially creating an additional access barrier for existing Medicaid beneficiaries. ©2013 Project HOPE."

In light of the ongoing national debate about immigration reform and the impact of the Affordable Care Act on immigrants, we examined differences in health care spending by nativity and legal status using Medical Expenditure Panel Survey data for the period 2000-09.We found that unauthorized, legal, and naturalized immigrants together accounted for $96.5 billion in average annual health care spending, compared to slightly more than $1 trillion for US natives.

Just 7.9 percent of unauthorized immigrants benefited from public-sector health care expenditures (receiving an average of $140 per person per year), compared to 30.1 percent of US natives (who received an average of $1,385).

We critically review a range of these efforts and show that many programs, although well-meaning, are unlikely to have much impact because they require information, expertise, and selfcontrol that few patients possess. As a result, benefits are likely to accrue disproportionately to patients who already are taking adequate care of their health. We show how these programs could be made more effective through the use of insights from behavioral economics. For example, incentive programs that offer patients small and frequent payments for behavior that would benefit the patients, such as medication adherence, can be more effective than programs with incentives that are far less visible because they are folded into a paycheck or used to reduce a monthly premium. Deploying more-nuanced insights from behavioral economics can lead to policies with the potential to increase patient engagement and deliver dividends for patients and favorable costeffectiveness ratios for insurers, employers, and other relevant commercial entities. ©2013 Project HOPE-The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc."

The WFTF data also suggest that for most states, the current demand for neurologist services already exceeds the supply, and by 2025 the demand for neurologists will be even higher. This future demand is fueled by the aging of the US population, the higher health care utilization rates of neurologic services, and by a greater number of patients gaining access to the health care system due to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Uncertainties in health care delivery and patient access exist due to looming concerns about further Medicare reimbursement cuts. This uncertainty is set against a backdrop of Congressional volatility on a variety of issues, including the repeal of the sustainable growth rate for physician reimbursement. The impact of these US health care changes on the neurology workforce, future increasing demands, reimbursement, and alternative health care delivery models including accountable care organizations, nonphysician providers such as nurse practitioners and physician assistants, and teleneurology for both stroke and general neurology are discussed.

Methods: A microsimulation supply model simulates likely career choices of individual neurologists, taking into account the number of newneurologists trained each year and changing demographics of the neurology workforce. A microsimulation demand model simulates utilization of neurology services for each individual in a representative sample of the population in each state and for the United States as a whole. Demand projections reflect increased prevalence of neurologic conditions associated with population growth and aging, and expanded coverage under health care reform. Results: The estimated active supply of 16,366 neurologists in 2012 is projected to increase to 18,060 by 2025. Long wait times for patients to see a neurologist, difficulty hiring new neurologists, and large numbers of neurologists who do not accept new Medicaid patients are consistent with a current national shortfall of neurologists. Demand for neurologists is projected to increase from ;18,180 in 2012 (11% shortfall) to 21,440 by 2025 (19% shortfall). This includes an increased demand of 520 full-time equivalent neurologists starting in 2014 from expanded medical insurance coverage associated with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Conclusions: In the absence of efforts to increase the number of neurology professionals and retain the existing workforce, current national and geographic shortfalls of neurologists are likely to worsen, exacerbating long wait times and reducing access to care for Medicaid beneficiaries. Current geographic differences in adequacy of supply likely will persist into the future.© 2013 American Academy of Neurology."

Private plans have been a part of the program since the 1970s. Debate about the policy goals--Should they cost less per beneficiary than FFS Medicare? Should they be available to all beneficiaries? Should they be able to offer additional benefits?--has long accompanied Medicare's private plan option.This debate is reflected in the history of Medicare payment policy,and policy decisions over the years have affected plans' willingness to participate and beneficiaries' enrollment at different periods of the program. Recently, evidence that the Medicare program was paying more per beneficiary in MA relative to what would have been spent under FFS Medicare prompted policymakers to reduce MA payments in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA). So far, plans continue to participate in MA and enrollment continues to grow, but payment reductions in 2012 through 2014 have been partially offset by payments made to plans through the quality bonus payment demonstration.This brief contains recent data on plan enrollment, availability, and benefits and discusses MA plan payment policy, including changes to MA payment made in the ACA and their actual and projected effects."

This issue brief highlights some of the health system changes that have taken place over the past 3 years, as well as some of the potential changes that are yet to come relating to insurance coverage, access to care, quality of care, rising health care costs, and overall population health."

Uncertainty exists regarding the scope of medical services required for new enrollees. Objective: To document the health care needs and health risks of uninsured adults who could gain Medicaid coverage under the ACA. These data will help physicians, other clinicians, and state Medicaid programs prepare for the possible expansions. Design, Setting, and Patients: Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2007-2010 were used to analyze health conditions among a nationally representative sample of 1042 uninsured adults aged 19 through 64 years with income no more than 138% of the federal poverty level, compared with 471 low-income adults currently enrolled in Medicaid. Main Outcomes and Measures: Prevalence and control of diabetes, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia based on examinations and laboratory tests, measures of self-reported health status including medical conditions, and risk factors such as measured obesity status. Results: Compared with those already enrolled in Medicaid, uninsured adults were less likely to be obese and sedentary and less likely to report a physical, mental, or emotional limitation. They also were less likely to have several chronic conditions. For example, 30.1% (95% CI, 26.8%-33.4%) of uninsured adults had hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, or diabetes compared with 38.6% (95% CI, 32.0%-45.3%) of those enrolled in Medicaid (P =.02). However, if they had these conditions, uninsured adults were less likely to be aware of them and less likely to have them controlled. For example, 80.1% (95% CI, 75.2%-85.1%) of the uninsured adults with at least 1 of these 3 conditions had at least 1 uncontrolled condition, compared with 63.4% (95% CI, 53.7%-73.1%) of adults enrolled in Medicaid. Conclusion and Relevance: Compared with adults currently enrolled in Medicaid, uninsured low-income adults potentially eligible to enroll in Medicaid under the ACA had a lower prevalence of many chronic conditions. A substantial proportion of currently uninsured adults with chronic conditions did not have good disease control; projections based on sample weighting suggest this may represent 3.5 million persons (95% CI, 2.9 million-4.2 million). These adults may need initial intensive medical care following Medicaid enrollment. ©2013 American Medical Association. All rights reserved."

A change from Medicare's fee-for-service reimbursement model to bundled payments offers one avenue for resolution. Pilots using such payment models have realized varying degrees of success, leading to the development and upcoming implementation of a bundled payment initiative led by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation.

Implications: Reimbursement models that reward those health systems that are able to meet benchmark performance standards will result in major shifts in how health systems operate. Expertise in care coordination across the healthcare continuum is essential for maximum reimbursement. Payment for value instead of volume delivered is a major reimbursement transition coming to the acute care setting, necessitating increased attention to mining data necessary to capture quality patient outcomes for maximum reimbursement.

Channeling patients toward more effective services is one of many approaches being used to control costs while improving health outcomes. This paper reviews value-based insurance design (VBID) concepts and discusses options for states to encourage these designs in the new health insurance exchanges (HIEs). Methods: We reviewed the literature on VBID as well as the text of the ACA for descriptions of how VBID might be encouraged through the new state health insurance exchanges. Results: States, under healthcare reform, are allowed to promote the use of VBID designs in their exchanges. There are 4 broad approaches a state HIE could pursue with regard to VBID, ranging from establishing a process for recommending high- or low-value services and requiring plans to adhere to the recommendations, to offering no guidance to plans. The evidence surrounding how well VBID designs work is growing, but it is still limited. To date there is no evidence that reducing or eliminating copays for preventive services cuts costs in the long term. However, modeling does suggest the potential for such long-term savings,so states should proceed with caution. Conclusions: Modifying copays, even in small amounts, can send signals to patients about the relative value of drugs and services. However, long-term savings will likely result from higher copays on low-value services. The leadership of each exchange has a unique opportunity to reshape the insurance benefit landscape in its state to improve value and invest in prevention."

We hypothesized that there are specific demographic factors associated with higher or lower physician satisfaction (PS) scores in trauma patients. METHODS: Press-Ganey PS scores for September 2004 to December 2010 were compared with trauma variables and the association of a mean PS greater than or equal to 75 (high score) or less than or equal to 50 (low score). Those variables that proved significant on univariate analysis were subjected to multivariate logistic regression analysis. Significance was at p G 0.05. RESULTS: There were 12,196 admissions, of whom 1,631 (13.4%) returned patient satisfaction survey. A total of 1,174 patients (75.5%) returned a high PS (Q75), and 126 patients (8.1%) returned a low PS (e50). In the multiple logistic regression analysis, 65 years or older (odds ratio [OR], 1.7), having had a surgical procedure (OR, 1.6), and having a positive impression of the hospital care (OR, 7.0) proved significant for a high PS. Those patients who scored a low PS were significantly more likely to be younger (18-29 years: OR, 2.4; 30-64 years: OR, 1.8), to have not had surgery (OR, 2.2), had an Injury Severity Score (ISS) of 16 or lower (OR, 2.6), had a complication of care (OR, 4.4), and rated the hospital care as poor (OR, 9.2). CONCLUSION: A trauma patient who is satisfied with his or her physician care is one who is 65 years or older, requires surgery, and is predominantly satisfied with other aspects of their hospital care. Unsatisfied patients are younger, are nonoperative, had lower ISS, had a complication of care, and rated their hospital care as poor. Understanding the specific characteristics of Press-Ganey results for trauma patients will allow trauma surgeons and their hospital partners to develop strategies to improve patients' satisfaction with their trauma surgeon's care.

Further work is needed to refine the instrument for a diverse range of health-care providers and to correlate social capital measures with quality of patient care. Implications for nursing management: Social capital measurement of the nurse work environment has the potential to provide managers with an enhanced set of tools for building productive capacity in health-care organisations and achieving desired outcomes. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."

Methods: Opioid dependent patients (. N=. 266) inducted on buprenorphine between July 2007 and December 2008 were retrospectively assessed at Connecticut's largest FQHC network. Six-month BMT retention and opioid-free time were collected longitudinally from electronic health records; 136 (51.1%) of patients were followed for at least 12 months. Results: Participants had a mean age of 40.1 years, were primarily male (69.2%) and treated by family practitioners (70.3%). Co-morbidity included HCV infection (59.8%), mood disorders (71.8%) and concomitant cocaine use (59%). Retention on BMT was 56.8% at 6 months and 61.6% at 12 months for the subset observed over 1 year. Not being retained on BMT at 12 months was associated with cocaine use (AOR. =. 2.18; 95% CI. =. 1.35-3.50) while prescription of psychiatric medication (AOR. =. 0.36; 95% CI 0.20-0.62) and receiving on-site substance abuse counseling (AOR. =. 0.34; 95% CI 0.19, 0.59) improved retention. Two thirds of the participants experienced at least one BMT gap of 2 or more weeks with a mean gap length of 116.4 days. Conclusions: Integrating BMT in this large FQHC network resulted in retention rates similarly reported in clinical trials and emphasizes the need for providing substance abuse counseling and screening for and treating psychiatric comorbidity. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd."

Objectives: 1) Explore psychometrics of the multidimensional Stay Well and Healthy! Health Risk Appraisal tool (SWH-HRA) among persons aging with disabilities acquired in early or mid-life, and 2) Assess SWH-HRA application to characterize disability subgroup differences. Methods: Psychometric analysis conducted on SWH-HRA interview data collected with 93 participants with an acquired disability of at least five years or more post-onset. ANOVA and Chi-square to explore differences in risks by subgroups identified by etiology (traumatic brain injury, stroke, spinal cord injury, and movement disorders). Results: A high prevalence of health risks was noted. Risks were associated with health, participation and quality of life outcomes.

These annually reported, publically available data are a major strategic opportunity to improve screening rates for CRC.

Methods and Results-We identified all readmissions within 30 days of discharge after PCI in nonfederal hospitals in Massachusetts between October 1, 2005, and September 30, 2008. Within a two-thirds random sample (Developmental cohort), we developed 2 parsimonious multivariable models to predict all-cause 30-day readmission, the first incorporating only variables known before cardiac catheterization (pre-PCI model), and the second incorporating variables known at discharge (Discharge model). Models were validated within the remaining one-third sample (Validation cohort), and model discrimination and calibration were assessed. Of 36 060 PCI patients surviving to discharge, 3760 (10.4%) patients were readmitted within 30 days. Significant pre-PCI predictors of readmission included age, female sex, Medicare or State insurance, congestive heart failure, and chronic kidney disease. Post-PCI predictors of readmission included lack of β-blocker prescription at discharge, post-PCI vascular or bleeding complications, and extended length of stay. Discrimination of the pre-PCI model (C-statistic=0.68) was modestly improved by the addition of post-PCI variables in the Discharge model (C-statistic=0.69; integrated discrimination improvement, 0.009; P<0.001). Conclusions-These prediction models can be used to identify patients at high risk for readmission after PCI and to target high-risk patients for interventions to prevent readmission. © 2013 American Heart Association, Inc."

These auspicious drugs are, however, inordinately expensive. The patents on many of these blockbuster biologics treatments will soon expire, creating high demand for cheap generic versions of biologics drugs. Yet until 2010, no FDA approval pathway for follow-on biologics existed in the United States. As part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Congress passed the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act. The BPCIA included an approval pathway for follow-on biologics modeled closely after the Hatch-Waxman approval process for generic small molecule drugs. Congress did not sufficiently consider the myriad of abuses that existed under the Hatch-Waxman Act, leaving open multiple avenues for abuse in the BPCIA, particularly in the Act's novel patent dispute resolution procedures. This Note analyzes several of the most serious issues with the BPCIA approval process. In particular, the BPCIA does not provide for any thirdparty input or public notification in the patent dispute provisions. Further, the BPCIA places no limit on abusive pay-to-delay settlements between pioneer and follow-on biologics manufacturers. This Note argues that Congress should amend the BPCIA to provide for greater public notification processes and opportunities for third-party intervention in patent disputes. Congress should also act to significantly limit pay-to-delay settlements by requiring the filing of such settlements with the FTC and DOJ for approval. Through such amendments, Congress will finally achieve a follow-on biologics process that provides significant avenues for both competition and innovation in the biologics industry."

Nevertheless, a number of interweaving provisions embedded within the Affordable Care Act create strong incentives that, starting in 2014, will tend to undermine these markets and, in the process, increase the fiscal cost of reform. First, small employers with predominantly low-income employees will tend to opt out of small-group markets. Second, small employers with mixed-income employees will have strong incentives to offer coverage that is either technically not ""affordable"" or that fails to provide ""minimum value"" in order to preserve the availability of premium and cost-sharing subsidies on individual markets for their low-income employees. Third, small employers with unusually low-risk employees will have strong incentives to self-insure any group plan they do offer in order to avoid cross-subsidizing higher-risk groups. Analyzing these risks collectively, this Article offers a number of recommendations for saving small-group markets. For instance, it argues that the Small Employer (""SHOP"") exchanges that are intended to organize small-group markets in 2014 must strategically target the weaknesses of selfinsurance by offering simple and risk-free coverage options that facilitate employee choice. They must also market this coverage aggressively in response to insurance brokers' likely financial incentives to push selfinsurance on small employers. Additionally, state and federal regulators should explore various possibilities for making small employers more likely to offer group coverage through SHOP exchanges. To accomplish this, they should consider regulating stop-loss insurance and preventing churning between the self-insured and small-group markets."

Part of the reason is that administrative law scholars typically train their attention on the sources of external control over agencies' exercise of the vast discretion that Congress so often delegates to them. Medicare's administrators, however, wield considerably less policy discretion than the agencies that feature prominently in the legal commentary. Traditional administrative law thus yields slim insight into Medicare's operation. But questions about external control do not-or at least they should not- exhaust the field. An old and often disregarded tradition in administrative law focuses not on external constraints, but on the internal control measures that agencies employ to shape the behavior of the bureaucrats who implement government programs on the ground. A robust set of internal controls is necessary whenever central administrators seek to align the actions of line officers with programmatic goals. And they are all the more necessary when, as is so often the case in the modern administrative state, implementation authority is vested in private actors, not government officers. So it is with Medicare, whose street-level bureaucrats are hundreds of thousands of private physicians with strong professional commitments and no particular allegiance to governmental priorities. Yet Congress's persistent failure to address weaknesses in Medicare's administrative structure has stymied a series of major reform efforts that have sought to make the program's physicians more attentive to the cost and quality of the medical care for which it pays. This dismal history suggests that crafting an effective internal law for Medicare will require Congress to refashion the program around private organizations with the capacity, incentives, and legitimacy to align the practice patterns of private physicians-its bedside bureaucrats-with federal priorities. Measured against that baseline, the set of Medicare reforms included in the Affordable Care Act is a disappointment. A more muscular, thoughtful, and sustained effort is needed."

Sebelius (NFIB), which addressed the constitutional challenge to the Affordable Care Act. As Justice Ginsburg pointed out, NFIB marks ""the first time ever"" that the Court has held that a spending condition unconstitutionally coerced the states. The implications of that holding are potentially massive, and some of the language in the decision, if read broadly, would seriously threaten the constitutionality of a broad swath of federal spending legislation. Notwithstanding some of the Court's language, this Article contends that the case is not best read as rendering federal spending conditions unconstitutional simply because they are attached to large amounts of federal money, change the terms of participation in entrenched cooperative programs, or tie together separate programs into a package deal. Rather, Chief Justice Roberts's pivotal opinion is best read as adopting an ""anti-leveraging principle"" that will find coercion only where all three of these conditions are present at the same time. The anti-leveraging principle both makes the most sense of what the Chief Justice actually said in NFIB and does a better job of accommodating the relevant constitutional values than do plausible alternative readings of the case. Although that principle threatens the constitutionality of far fewer conditionalspending laws than do those alternative readings, it raises challenging questions about the constitutionality of certain spending conditions. And it gives states an important new tool in negotiations with federal administrators."

Physical activity equivalent labels present calorie information in terms of the amount of physical activity that would be required to expend the calories in a specified food item. Methods. Three focus groups with a total of twenty participants discussed food choices and nutrition labeling. They provided information on comprehension, usability and acceptability of the label. A systematic coding process was used to apply descriptive codes to the data and to identify emerging themes and attitudes. Results: Participants in all three groups were able to comprehend the label format. Discussion about label format focused on issues including gender of the depicted figure, physical fitness of the figure, preference for walking or running labels, and preference for information in miles or minutes. Feedback from earlier focus groups was used to refine the labels in an iterative process. Conclusions: In contrast to calorie labels, participants shown physical activity labels asked and answered, ""How does this label apply to me?""

The purpose of this study was to examine factors associated with general surgeon workforce within counties in Tennessee in light of the ACA. Materials and methods: The Area Resource File for 2011 was utilized for this study. Counties with less than 3 active surgeons/100,000 persons were classified as shortage counties (SC). Counties with more than 6 active surgeons/100,000 persons were considered over-supply counties (OC). Demographic factors for each county were determined. Univariate and multivariable analysis was used to determine factors associated with SC. Results: There are 95 counties in the state and 45.3% were SC and 33.7% were OC. Sixty-nine (72.6%) of the counties had at least one hospital and 57 (60%) were in non-metro counties. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that increasing percent uninsured in a county was positively associated with a SC. No other factors were associated with SC. To meet the cutoff of three surgeons per 100,000 in SC 23 general surgeons would be required. There was an excess of 219 general surgeons in OCs. Conclusions: There appears to be an adequate supply of general surgeons but a maldistribution exists, particularly if demand increases with the implementation of the ACA. If redistribution of surgeons does not occur through natural changes in supply and demand, careful policy changes may be considered to encourage redistribution of surgeon resources to meet demand in counties that are currently underserved. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Children's hospitals are not yet among these hospitals, although that is likely to change. Because chronic neurologic conditions represent a sizable proportion of all children's hospitals costs, and because some/many of the readmissions might not be easily prevented, children's hospitals and neurologists who care for children might be inappropriately penalized for some readmissions. We encourage more study to identify the correlates of readmission of children who have a neurologic disorder."

In 2009 Wisconsin created a new public insurance program for low-income uninsured childless adults. We analyzed administrative claims data spanning 2008 and 2009 using a case-crossover study design on a population of 9,619 Wisconsin residents with very low incomes who were automatically enrolled in this program in January 2009. In the twelve months following enrollment in public insurance, outpatient visits for the studypopulation increased 29 percent, and emergency department visits increased 46 percent.

With fourteen states opting out, we estimate that 3.6 million fewer people would be insured, federal transfer payments to those states could fall by $8.4 billion, and state spending on uncompensated carecould increase by $1 billion in 2016, compared to what would be expected if all states participated in the expansion.

The aim of the study was to provide information on the need for substance use disorder treatment among individuals who may be eligible for Medicaid under the ACA. Methods: The 2008 and 2009 National Survey on Drug Use and Health provided data on demographic characteristics, health status, and substance use disorders for comparison of current low-income Medicaid enrollees (N=3,809) with currently uninsured individuals with household incomes that may qualify them for Medicaid coverage beginning in 2014 (N=5,049). The incomes of the groups compared were 138%of the federal poverty level (133%provided in the ACA plus a 5%income ""disregard"" allowed by the law). Results: The rate of substance use disorders among currently uninsured incomeeligible individuals was slightly higher than the rate among current Medicaid enrollees (14.6%versus 11.5%, p=.03). Although both groups had significant unmet need for substance use disorder treatment, the treatment rate among those who needed treatment was significantly lower in the income-eligible group than in the currently enrolled group (31.3%versus 46.8%, p<.01). When the analysis excluded informal care received outside the medical sector, treatment rates among those with treatment needs were much lower in both groups (12.8%in the incomeeligible group and 30.7%among current enrollees). Conclusions: Findings suggest that Medicaid insurance expansions under the ACA will reduce unmet need for substance use disorder treatment."

This article examines rural issues surrounding network adequacy standards, and offers recommendations for crafting standards that optimize rural access. Method: This policy analysis reviews ACA requirements for QHP network adequacy standards, considering Medicaid managed care and Medicare Advantage (MA) standards as models. We analyze the implications of stringent vs flexible access standards in terms of how choices might affect health plans' participation in rural markets and rural enrollees' access to care. Finally, we propose strategies for designing standards with the degree of flexibility most likely to benefit rural consumers. Findings: A traditional approach to safeguarding rural access is to impose strict network adequacy standards on plans in rural areas. However, if strict standards prove difficult to meet due to rural provider scarcity, they might diminish QHPs' willingness to serve rural areas. Thus, they could exacerbate rather than alleviate rural access problems. Conclusions: To benefit rural communities, network adequacy standards must be strong enough to provide real protections for beneficiaries, yet flexible enough to accommodate rural delivery system constraints and remain attainable for QHPs. Useful strategies to achieve this balance might include: adjusting standards according to degrees of rurality and rural utilization norms; counting midlevel clinicians toward fulfillment of patient-provider ratios; and allowing plans to ensure rural access through delivery system innovations such as telehealth. © 2013 National Rural Health Association."

We examined the impact of Massachusetts health reform and its public health component (enacted in 2006) on change in health insurance coverage by perceived health. Methods. We used 2003-2009 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data. We used a difference-in-differences framework to examine the experience in Massachusetts to predict the outcomes of national health care reform. Results. The proportion of adults aged 18 to 64 years with health insurance coverage increased more in Massachusetts than in other New England states (4.5%; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.5%, 5.6%). For those with higher perceived health care need (more recent mentally and physically unhealthy days and activity limitation days [ALDs]), the postreform proportion significantly exceeded prereform (P < .001). Groups with higher perceived health care need represented a disproportionate increase in health insurance coverage in Massachusetts compared with other New England states-from 4.3% (95% CI = 3.3%, 5.4%) for fewer than 14 ALDs to 9.0% (95% CI = 4.5%, 13.5%) for 14 or more ALDs.

The consensus article was subsequently published and remains a vital resource for projecting emergency medicine workforce needs. In reaction to the enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, representatives from the same major organizations in emergency medicine convened in Dallas in January 2011. There was consensus that health care reform had the potential to increase the percentage of physicians, not just emergency physicians, employed by large groups or hospitals. Concerns were also raised about the need for physicians to gather non-value-added data that do not benefit the patient. The following additional areas emerged as topics of concern: the projected physician workforce requirements in emergency medicine, the provision of quality care in rural areas, effect of health care reform on the practice of emergency medicine, particularly the threat of increased employment of physicians, the role of nonphysicians in providing emergency care within the ED and in the out-ofhospital setting, and the use of telemedicine to expand the reach of the emergency physician workforce. The group agreed that (1) emergency care should be provided by physicians who are board certified by the American Board of Emergency Medicine (ABEM)/American Osteopathic Board of Emergency Medicine (AOBEM) in emergency medicine or residency trained in emergency medicine, and when of necessity care is provided by non-board-certified physicians, such individuals should have additional training, oversight, and continuing medical education; (2) all providers of emergency care should maintain lifelong learning in emergency medicine in addition to the requirements of their primary specialty; (3) rural emergency care requires the same skills and training as urban care and perhaps is more challenging because of the lack of ready access to consultants; emergency physician shortages will likely be more pronounced in rural areas in the near future; (4) ideally, all health care providers in emergency departments (EDs) will have access to the expertise of an emergency physician either on site or through telemedicine; (5) the clinical practice of emergency medicine should be based on the benefit to the patient (""value-added""); (6) quality measures of emergency care should be developed by the specialty of emergency medicine and should be evidence based and validated; and (7) the electronic medical record should enhance the practice of emergency medicine and benefit the patient. Specific to the Affordable Care Act, the group suggested that (1) areas of special interest for emergency medicine include alternatives to hospital admission, alternatives to advanced imaging, alternatives to consultation, confronting issues of futile care, and facilitating early palliative care; (2) a compendium of possible options or alternatives to traditional ED care be devised that would include observation medicine, case management, callback systems, community paramedicine, telemedicine, home health care, and telecommunication vehicles; and (3) physicians, particularly young physicians, be made aware of their rights in vany employment model.

Methods: Numerous public data sets and actuarial methods were used to estimate spending for services from specialty behavioral health providers (general hospital specialty units; specialty hospitals; psychiatrists; other behavioral health professionals; and specialty mental health and substance abuse treatment centers). Results: Between 1986 and 2005, hospitals-which had received the largest share of behavioral health spending-declined in importance, and spending shares trended away from specialty hospitals that were largely funded by state and local governments. Hospitals' share of funding from private insurance decreased from 25%in 1986 to 12%in 2005, and the Medicaid share increased from 11%to 23%. Office-based specialty providers continued to be largely dependent on private insurance and out-of-pocket payments, with psychiatrists receiving increased Medicaid funding. Specialty centers received increased funding shares fromMedicaid (from 11%to 29%), and shares from other state and local government sources fell (from 64%to 46%). Conclusions: With ACA's full implementation, spending on behavioral health will likely increase under private insurance and Medicaid. Parity in private plans will also push a larger share of payments for office-based professionals from out-of-pocket payments to private insurance. As ACA provides insurance for formerly uninsured individuals, funding by state behavioral health authorities of center-based treatment will likely refocus on recovery and support services. Federal Medicaid rules will increase in importance as more people needing behavioral health treatment become covered."

The authors also describe new options for financing that will become available as the Affordable Care Act (ACA) is implemented more fully. The ACA will rationalize coverage of firstepisode services, but the allimportant Medicaid provisions will also require individual state action to implement services optimally."

The reasoning of his decision is equally surprising. He resorted to semantic gamesmanship and suspect logic to find the law constitutional. Congress explicitly bottomed its enactment of the mandate on its authority under the Constitution to regulate interstate commerce. It invoked only this authority; it did not pretend to be acting under its constitutional power to impose taxes. President Obama specifically assured Americans that the penalty was not a tax. The administration also argued, as a backup, that if the mandate is not authorized under the Commerce Clause, the penalty it imposes for failing to have the required insurance is nonetheless constitutional as an exercise of Congress's authority to levy taxes."

While states are given the opportunity to develop and administer these private insurance marketplaces, their plans must meet certain minimum standards or risk preemption by the federal government. This policy design establishes a hybrid model of intergovernmental policy making, which may serve to heighten conflict during implementation and further polarize states' policies. Using new data on states' efforts to establish exchanges and repeated-events duration modeling, we examine states' early exchange implementation-identifying a key role for ideological and partisan considerations, as well as the implications of a federal policy design that puts conservative states in the difficult political position of choosing between resisting a law they oppose and preventing further federal intrusion. © 2013 The Author."

The model we must now practice and teach is one that emphasizes collaboration and prevention, quality and efficiency. Changes in practice recommended by the 2001 US Institute of Medicine report are being implemented system-wide, following the enactment of the US Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. This paper discusses the evolving needs of patients with chronic psychiatric illness, and the psychiatrist's role in a rapidly changing healthcare landscape as a care provider, an interdisciplinary role model, and educator. In an aging population in which multi-morbidity is the norm, episodic, crisis-driven care is prohibitively expensive and does not serve patients well. Yet we still teach that model of care. The medications we prescribe for psychiatric illness, particularly antipsychotics, can cause and/or aggravate some of the commonest chronic medical illnesses; psychiatric educators must address the management of these complications. The management of chronic psychiatric illness in multi-morbid patients demands that we practice and teach a 'whole patient' approach to care, preferably delivered as part of a patient-centred team. The Affordable Care Act has mandated and created opportunities for new models designed to facilitate this, and a paradigm shift is needed in medical education. Clinicians must become adept at identifying underlying and contributing factors and collaborating with the patient, other providers, and the patient's family and significant others. Psychiatric formulation and patient care rely on these principles; we must now teach their application to other specialties, disciplines and professions. © 2013 Institute of Psychiatry."

The Medicare Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) Survey is the largest survey of Medicare beneficiaries about their care experiences. Each year, a nationally representative random sample of beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans receive a mail survey, followed by a telephone follow-up of nonrespondents. The mail survey lists the respondent's plan name at the beginning and repeats the plan name in several of the questions. However, some beneficiaries may not recognize their plan name, potentially affecting their level of engagement with the survey and, in turn, unit and item response rates. An alternative approach is to use a generic survey in which the plan name appears only once, on the back of the survey booklet. This manuscript reports the results of a 2010 experiment in which a random subsample of beneficiaries were mailed a generic survey. Differences in unit and item response rates, as well as evaluations of care experiences, between beneficiaries who received a generic survey and those who received a customized survey were compared. The use of a generic survey did not appear to affect either unit or item response rates, and did not appear to affect the ways in which beneficiaries evaluate various aspects of their care experiences. These results suggest that generic mail surveys may be preferable to customized surveys, especially since they entail lower printing and mailing costs. © 2012 The Author."

To evaluate the extent to which Medicaid versus commercial insurance status affects outcomes after lumbar stenosis surgery. Summary of Background Data. The Affordable Care Act aims to expand health insurance and to help narrow existing health care disparities. Medicaid patients have previously been noted to be at an increased risk for impaired access to health care. Conversely, those with commercial insurance may be subject to overtreatment. We examine the surgical treatment of low back pain as an example that has raised significant public health concerns. Methods. A total of 28,462 patients, ages 18 and older, were identified who had undergone laminectomy or fusion for spinal stenosis between 2000 and 2009. Patients were characterized by baseline demographic information, comorbidity burden, and type of insurance (Medicaid vs. commercial insurance). Multivariate analysis was performed comparing the relative effect of insurance status on reoperation rates, timing and type of reoperations, postoperative complications, and total postoperative health resource use. Results. Medicaid patients had similar reoperation rates to commercially insured patients at 1 year (4.60% vs. 5.42%, P = .38); but had significantly lower reoperation rates at 2 (7.22% vs. 10.30%; adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 0.661; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.533-0.820; P = .0002) and more than 2 years (13.92% vs. 16.89%; aOR = 0.722; 95% CI, 0.612-0.851; P < .0001). Medicaid patients were particularly less likely to undergo fusion as a reoperation (aOR = 0.478; 95% CI, 0.377-0.606; P < 0001). Medicaid patients had greater health care resource utilization as measured by hospital days, outpatient services and medications prescribed; however, commercially insured patients had significantly higher overall health utilization costs at 1 and 2 years. Conclusion. There are insurance disparities that affect important surgical outcomes after initial surgery for spinal stenosis. Efforts for national health care reform should include explicit efforts to identify such system factors that will reduce current inequities in care. Copyright © 2013 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins."

More recently, Section 6411 of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) expanded the RAC program to include the Medicaid program. This shows the Cent ers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) believe RAC audits are a cost-effective method to ensure health care providers are paid correctly and thereby protect the Medicare Trust Fund. RAC audits are highly complex and require significant manpower to handle the large volume of requests received during a short period of time. Additionally, the RAC audit appeal process is complicated and requires a high level of technical expertise. The demonstration project found that RAC audits resulted in sizeable amounts of overpayments collected (""take-backs"") from many providers. This research study assesses the potential impact of the RAC audit program on US acute care hospitals. Data obtained from CMS show that RAC overpayments collected for FY 2010 were $75.4 million, increased to $797.4 million in FY 2011, and increased to $986.2 million in the first six months of FY 2012. According to the American Hospital Association (AHA) RACTrac audit survey, the vast majority of these collections represent complex denials where hospitals are required to provide medical record documents in support of their billed claims. This study found that the RAC audit program collections are increasing significantly over time. As a result, these collections are having a significant negative impact on the profitability of US hospitals."

Study Design: Case analysis. Methods: We reviewed literature on healthcare costs in Hawaii and analyzed descriptive statelevel and national data from a variety of sources, including MEPS and Hawaii's Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs. In addition, we conducted 14 interviews with 12 stakeholder organizations in Hawaii's healthcare market, including representatives of health plans, delivery systems, physicians, employers, government, the non-profit sector, and academia. Results: After almost 40 years of mandated employer-based coverage, Hawaii has a lower uninsured rate than other states and lower employer-based premiums. Stakeholders we interviewed attributed lower costs in part to the concentrated insurance market, in which the dominant carrier acts largely like a single payer in the commercial market; stakeholders raised administrative cost efficiencies and negotiating clout as factors contributing to lower employerbased premiums. While premiums are lower than the US average, the rate of growth in costs is not. As a result, Hawaii's healthcare stakeholders are focused on aligning incentives for payers and providers. Conclusions: Based on interviews with stakeholders and the review of current data, we conclude that mandated coverage will not slow the inexorable rise in healthcare costs or solve the growing affordability issues for health insurance in the United States. To expand access to coverage in a manner that is sustainable over time, healthcare cost growth must be addressed. Copyright © HCPLive 2006-2013 | Intellisphere, LLC."

One way to overcome common barriers to care for low-income women is to do therapy in the mother's home. The objective of this study was to compare the cost-effectiveness of in-home interpersonal therapy (IPT) to two standard therapies for depression treatment: office based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and psychotropic medication. This cost utility analysis used a Markov model with a 3-year time horizon to compare the cost-effectiveness of the alternate therapies from the public payer perspective. We followed a hypothetical cohort of 1,000 women age 19 to 35 years with depressive symptoms who had an income level at or below 200% of the federal poverty level. Costs were based on the number of women who completed the therapy. We used data from published literature on clinical trials with low-income minority women to determine the completion rates, duration, and effectiveness of each type of therapy. Additionally, costs for in-home IPT were calculated from unpublished trial data. Costs were determined using 2011 North Carolina Medicaid reimbursement rates; utility weights were taken from published literature. The endpoint was the total outpatient medical cost (therapy and outpatient medical visits). The study outcomes were depression free days (DFD), which were translated into quality of adjusted life years (QALY). We calculated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of each therapy based on the number of QALYs gained. We conducted deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses to determine how robust the results were to uncertainty in the parameters. Treating patients with IPT resulted in an ICER of USD 13,479/QALY and USD 29,309/QALY as compared to CBT and medications, respectively. The results were most sensitive to the efficacy of IPT. Simulations showed that, with a threshold of USD 50,000/QALY, IPT was cost-effective 95% and 78% of the time as compared to CBT and medications, respectively. If policy makers were willing to pay USD 50,000 per QALY, IPT had a 0.586 probability of being the cost-effective option relative to medication and in-office CBT. Due to higher completion rates, in-home IPT cost more but resulted in more QALYs gained than the other therapies. Our results indicated that in-home IPT was cost-effective as compared to office-based CBT and at least as cost-effective as medication therapy. The analysis was based on limited data because there have been few randomized, controlled studies on treatments for depression in low-income women, however; additional studies are needed to improve the accuracy of the model. In coming years, the number of low-income women covered by public insurance should increase due to the Affordable Care Act. Given the high prevalence of depression in this population, it will be important to consider the value of potential resources spent on depression treatments. This study found that both in-home IPT and medication could be cost-effective treatments for depression. The results of this study support public payers reimbursing for in-home services."

We conducted a study to determine how the implementation of this provision changed rates of insurance coverage for young adults seeking medical care for major emergencies. METHODS: We evaluated more than 480,000 nondiscretionary visits made to emergency departments from 2009 through 2011, as recorded in a large, geographically diverse data set of hospital claims, to estimate how the ACA provision affected private insurance coverage of such visits by young adults (19 to 25 years of age). To adjust for underlying trends in insurance coverage, we compared changes in the target age group with changes among adults 26 to 31 years of age, who were unaffected by the provision (control group). RESULTS: After the ACA provision took effect, private coverage of nondiscretionary visits to emergency departments by young adults increased by 3.1 percentage points (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.3 to 3.9; relative increase, 5.2%; P<0.001), as compared with similar visits in the control group. The percentage of visits by uninsured young adults also fell significantly (-1.7 percentage points; 95% CI, -2.8 to -0.7; relative decrease, 9.1%; P<0.001). The rates of nondiscretionary visits that were covered by Medicaid or other nonprivate insurers remained relatively steady throughout the study period. The coverage expansion led to an estimated 22,072 visits to emergency departments by newly insured young adults and $147 million in associated costs that were covered by private insurance plans during a 1-year period. CONCLUSIONS: Enactment of the dependent-coverage provision was associated with a significant increase in the proportion of young adults who were protected from the financial consequences of a serious medical emergency.

These annually reported, publically available data are a major strategic opportunity to improve screening rates for CRC.

If fully implemented as planned, the PPACA has the potential to improve reproductive health in the United States in at least three ways: increasing the number of women and men with insurance coverage; increasing the value of insurance coverage for addressing reproductive health needs; and improving access to reproductive health services and information more generally. Several PPACA provisions stand out as having particular importance for reproductive health, including Medicaid family planning expansions, standards for an essential health benefits package, expanded coverage for contraception and other clinical preventive services, and teen pregnancy prevention programs.

Our results also suggest that many young women who would otherwise lack health insurance after aging out of foster care will be eligible for Medicaid under the health care reform law.

Others will study its implications for constitutional limits on a range of federal powers beyond health care. This article considers to what extent the decision is also about health care law, properly conceived. Under one view, health care law is the subdiscipline that inquires how courts and government actors take account of the special features of medicine that make legal or policy issues especially problematic - rather than regarding health care delivery and finance more generically, like most any other economic or social enterprise. Viewed this way, the opinions from the Court's conservative justices are mainly about general constitutional law principles. In contrast, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's dissenting opinion for the four more liberal justices is just as much about health care law as it is about constitutional law.

This is not an accurate picture of American governance as it has operated over the past half century - most important areas of American life are regulated concurrently by both the federal government and the states. The Supreme Court's June 2012 decision clearing the way for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) to move forward thus should not be regarded as an affront to state sovereignty but as a realistic embrace of state power in its active, modern form. The PPACA is infused with multiple major roles for the states, and as the statute goes into operation over the next few years, states retain, and are already exercising, substantial policy discretion. © 2013 by Duke University Press."

The highly political opinions of two federal district judges - carefully chosen by challenging plaintiffs - of no particular distinction did not shake that confidence that the act was constitutional. This disdain for the challengers' arguments was only confirmed when the act was upheld by two highly respected conservative court of appeals judges in two separate circuits. But after the hostile, even mocking questioning of the government's advocate in the Supreme Court by the five Republican-appointed justices, the expectation was that the act would indeed be struck down on that ground. So it came as no surprise when the five opined the act did indeed exceed Congress's commerce clause power. But it came as a great surprise when Chief Justice John Roberts, joined by the four Democrat-appointed justices, ruled that the act could be sustained as an exercise of Congress's taxing power - a ground urged by the government almost as an afterthought. It was further surprising, even shocking, that Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy, Clarence Thomas, and Samuel Alito not only wrote a joint opinion on the commerce clause virtually identical to that of their chief, but that in writing it they did not refer to or even acknowledge his opinion. Finally surprising was the fact that Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer joined the chief in holding that aspects of the act's Medicaid expansion were unconstitutional.

One such issue is how the states should structure the health insurance exchanges mandated by the new law. As funding is an important consideration in this decision, examining the approaches taken by the first eleven jurisdictions to act on the requirement may inform the decisions of other states. This Note examines the legislation passed by these ""vanguard states"" in response to the exchange mandate. In doing so, it denotes the array of funding options afforded to health insurance exchanges in the ""vanguard states"" and organizes them according to the governance models chosen by each state. The conclusion analyzes the rough trends apparent and recommends that states should choose the state-agency model in order to ensure the exchanges comply with the financial sustainability requirements of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act."

To examine health care access disparities with regard to health status and presence of functional limitations, a common measure of disability and multimorbidity, after controlling for individual's race/ethnicity, insurance status and income in the U.S. using the latest survey data. Methods. Using data from the 2009 Family Core component of the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), we examined six measures of access to care in the twelve months prior to the interview. Covariates included self-perceived health status and the presence of functional limitations, race/ethnicity, insurance status, income, and other socioeconomic characteristics. Multiple logistic regressions were used to examine the associations. Results: People with functional limitations or worse health status experience greater barriers to access. Insurance status was the single factor that was associated with all six measures of access. Disparities among racial/ethnic groups in most access indicators as well as income levels were insignificant after taking into account individuals' health status measures. Conclusions: Interventions to expand insurance coverage and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act are expected to contribute to reducing disparities in access to care. However, to further improve access to care, emphasis must be placed on those with poorer health status and functional limitations. © 2013 Wang et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd."

In recent years, the increasing cost of health care as well as the relatively large number of individuals without any health care insurance coverage has prompted repeated attempts to modify or overhaul the current health care delivery paradigm. The largest legislative change to this system occurred on March 23, 2010, when President Barack Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA).The PPACA is a multifaceted and sweeping piece of legislation. The law introduces a myriad number of changes into both public and private health insurance. Understanding the law, its implications, and how to navigate through these changes is essential to provide high-quality health care to patients. Although the law or parts of it are still at risk of being modified either through judicial or political action, it is important to recognize the current aspects of the law to understand any future modifications. Providing health care coverage in the United States is sure to be as it has always been: a constantly changing and evolving set of private and public policies that carry with them significant complexities and challenges. Health care providers must constantly strive to maximize access to and quality of medical care in whatever paradigm evolves in the future."

Clarity in the debate on reducing Medicare spending growth requires recognition of three important distinctions: the difference between public and total spending on health, the difference between the level of health spending and rate of health spending growth, and the difference between growth per beneficiary and growth in the number of beneficiaries in Medicare. The primary policy issue facing the US health care system is the rate of spending growth in public programs, and solving that problem will probably require reforms to the entire health care sector. The Affordable Care Act created a projected trajectory for Medicare spending per beneficiary that is lower than historical growth rates. Although opportunities for one-time savings exist, any long-term savings from Medicare, beyond those already forecast, will probably require a shift in spending from taxpayers to beneficiaries via higher beneficiary premium contributions (overall or via means testing), changes in eligibility, or greater cost sharing at the point of service. © 2013 Project HOPE-The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc."

FINDINGS/ CONCLUSIONS: In moving forward, the one fact that rings true is there will be constant change in our industry. As the health care terrain shifts and new influences continually surface, there will be consequences for case management practice. These impacts require nimble clinical professionals in possession of recognized and firmly established competencies. They must be agile to frame (and reframe) their professional practice to facilitate the best possible outcomes for their patients. Case managers can choose to be Gumby or Pokey. This is exactly why the definition of a competency-based case management modelÊs time has come, one sufficiently fluid to fit into any setting of care. IMPLICATIONS FOR CASE MANAGEMENT PRACTICE: The practice of case management transcends the vast array of representative professional disciplines and educational levels. A majority of current models are driven by business priorities rather than by the competencies critical to successful practice and quality patient outcomes. This results in a fragmented professional case management identity. While there is inherent value in what each discipline brings to the table, this advanced model unifies behind case managementÊs unique, strengths-based identity instead of continuing to align within traditional divisions (e.g., discipline, work setting, population served). This model fosters case managementÊs expanding career advancement opportunities, including a reflective clinical ladder.Copyright © 2013 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams and Wilkins."

The financial burden and unexpected costs were even more pronounced for families with greater numbers of children and for families with incomes below 400 percent of the federal poverty level. We conclude that those with lower incomes, increased health care needs, and more children will be at particular risk after they obtain coverage through exchanges in 2014.

Multiple team types fit within this definition, and they all need support from leadership to succeed. Teams have been invoked as a necessary tool to address the needs of patients with multiple chronic conditions and to address medical workforce shortages. Invoking teams, however, is much easier than making them function effectively, so we need to consider the implications of the growing emphasis on teams. Although the ACA will spur team development, organizational leadership must use what we know now to train, support, and incentivize team function. Meanwhile, we must also advance research regarding teams in health care to give those leaders more evidence to guide their work."

We examined the motivations for seeking recognition in one group and assessed why the group allowed recognition to lapse 3 years later. METHODS As part of a larger mixed methods case study, we conducted 38 key informant interviews with executives, clinicians, and front-line staff. Interviews were conducted according to a guide that evolved during the project and were audiorecorded and fully transcribed. Transcripts were analyzed and thematically coded. RESULTS PCMH principles were consistent with the organization's culture and mission, which valued innovation and putting patients fi rst. Motivations for implementing specifi c PCMH components varied; some components were seen as part of the organization's patient-centered culture, whereas others helped the practice compete in its local market. Informants consistently reported that National Committee for Quality Assurance recognition arose incidentally because of a 1-time incentive from a local group of large employers and because the organization decided to allocate some organizational resources to respond to the complex reporting requirements for about one-half of its clinics. CONCLUSIONS Becoming patient centered and seeking recognition as such ran along separate but parallel tracks within this organization. As the Affordable Care Act continues to focus attention on primary care redesign, this apparent disconnect should be borne in mind."

One such provision establishes a new category of health care provider - the accountable care organization. These organizations provide a form of coordinated health care delivery. The successful integration of an accountable care organization, along with a better coordinated, higher quality case management care model, will provide better access to health care, improved care transitions and safety for the patients, and lower costs to the health system. PRIMARY PRACTICE SETTING(S): Acute-care hospitals; ambulatory care centers; and primary care physician practices. FINDINGS/CONCLUSIONS: • Banner Health has experienced success, using a single standardized model for Case Management despite varying care settings. • The standardized process allows the interdisciplinary teams to use standardized assessment tools, ation plans, and workfl ows. As a result, Banner Health has experienced reductions in variations, duplications, and handoffs, as well as great effi ciencies, clearer communication, and improved outcomes. In addition, auxiliary programs have been developed to support and mimic the standardized approach to case management. • In 2012, the average length of stay for Banner Health was 3.81. This number represents an overall 7.52% improvement in average length of stay or a total of 66,986 total potential saved days across the 11 hospitals within the system. IMPLICATIONS FOR CASE MANAGEMENT PRACTICE: • A successful implementation of this type of case management model requires systematic changes to technological and organizational structures. • The stewards of the case management model must be proactive in garnering and maintaining executive and fi nancial support. • By designing an electronic documentation system with one workfl ow and a standard set of data defi nitions, health systems will be abe to provide standardization and reduce variations of care. This type of standardization creates a central database for easy reporting and decision making. • Achieved successes, associated with improved clinical outcomes, can translate into considerable reductions in the controllable expenses for a health system.Copyright © 2013 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams and Wilkins."

The empirical lens then focuses on one component of the US system, the Medicare program for the elderly and disabled. It shows how a fully public system has become increasingly privatized through a series of policy reforms starting in the 1990s.

Most tax-exempt hospitals will need to meet this requirement by the end of 2013. METHODS: We conducted a national study of the level and pattern of community benefits that tax-exempt hospitals provide. The study comprised more than 1800 tax-exempt hospitals, approximately two thirds of all such institutions. We used reports that hospitals filed with the Internal Revenue Service for fiscal year 2009 that provide expenditures for seven types of community benefits. We combined these reports with other data to examine whether institutional, community, and market characteristics are associated with the provision of community benefits by hospitals. RESULTS: Tax-exempt hospitals spent 7.5% of their operating expenses on community benefits during fiscal year 2009. More than 85% of these expenditures were devoted to charity care and other patient care services. Of the remaining community-benefit expenditures, approximately 5% were devoted to community health improvements that hospitals undertook directly. The rest went to education in health professions, research, and contributions to community groups. The level of benefits provided varied widely among the hospitals (hospitals in the top decile devoted approximately 20% of operating expenses to community benefits; hospitals in the bottom decile devoted approximately 1%). This variation was not accounted for by indicators of community need. CONCLUSIONS: In 2009, tax-exempt hospitals varied markedly in the level of community benefits provided, with most of their benefit-related expenditures allocated to patient care services. Little was spent on community health improvement. Copyright © 2013 Massachusetts Medical Society."

Although this legislation is the first massive social and regulatory overhaul completed through the tax code, in the past twenty-five years the U.S. Congress and presidential administrations have substantially increased their use of tax law for non-revenue-raising purposes. Growing reliance on the tax code represents a structural transformation of how Congress and presidential administrations have come to approach lawmaking goals. This transformation defies the near-consensus of previous tax scholarship, which, following Stanley Surrey, disapproves of embedding social and regulatory programs in the tax code. However, that dominant view rests on assumptions that have become outdated.

To achieve these goals in the newly emerging health care environment, the nephrology community must plan for and direct integrated delivery and coordination of renal care, focusing on population management. Even though the ESRD patient population is a complex group with comorbid conditions that may confound integration of care, the nephrology community has unique experience providing integrated care through ACO-like programs. Specifically, the recent ESRD Management Demonstration Project sponsored by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and the current ESRD Prospective Payment System with it Quality Incentive Program have demonstrated that integrated delivery of renal care can be accomplished in a manner that provides improved clinical outcomes with some financial margin of savings. Moving forward, integrated renal care will probably be linked to provider performance and quality outcomes measures, and clinical integration initiatives will share several common elements, namely performance-based payment models, coordination of communication via health care information technology, and development of best practices for care coordination and resource utilization. Integration initiatives must be designed to be measured and evaluated, and, consistent with principles of continuous quality improvement, each initiative will provide for iterative improvements of the initiative. © 2013 by the American Society of Nephrology."

This level of participation reflects the response of Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to criticism that the program as outlined in the proposed rule was overly burdensome, prescriptive, and too risky. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service made significant changes in the final rule, making the Accountable Care Organization program more attractive to these participants. However, none of these changes addressed the serious concerns raised by subspecialty societies-including theAmerican Society ofNephrology-regarding care of patients with multiple chronic comorbidities and complex and end stage conditions. Virtually all of these concerns remain unaddressed, and consequently, Accountable Care Organizations will require guidance and partnership from the nephrology community to ensure that these patients are identified and receive the individualized care that they require. Although the final rule fell short of addressing the needs of patients with kidney disease, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation presents an opportunity to test the potentially beneficial concepts of the Accountable Care Organization program within this patient population. The American Society of Nephrology Accountable Care Organization Task Force developed a set of principles that must be reflected in a possible pilot program or demonstration project of an integrated nephrology care delivery model. These principles include preserving a leadership role for nephrologists, encompassing care for patients with laterstage CKDand kidney transplants aswell as ESRD, enabling the participation of a diversity of dialysis provider sizes and types, facilitating research, and establishing monitoring systems to identify and address preferential patient selection or changes in outcomes. © 2013 by the American Society of Nephrology."

Data Sources Data came from three large employers and a sampling of premiums from ehealthinsurance.com. We supplemented the employer data with information on state Medicaid eligibility and costs from the Kaiser Family Foundation. National predictions were based on the MEPS Household Component. Study Design We estimated a conditional logit model of health plan choice in the large group market. Using the coefficients from the choice model, we predicted take-up in the group and individual health insurance markets. Following ACA implementation, we added choices to the individual market corresponding to plans that will be available in state and federal exchanges. Depending on eligibility for premium subsidies, we reduced the out-of-pocket premiums for those choices. We simulated several possible patterns for states opting out of the Medicaid expansion, as allowed by the Supreme Court. Principal Findings The ACA will increase coverage substantially in the private insurance market and Medicaid. HSAs will remain desirable in both the individual and employer markets. Conclusions If states opt out of the Medicaid expansion, this could increase the federal cost of health reform, while reducing the number of newly covered lives. © Health Research and Educational Trust."

Methodology The model considers the risk that the firm bears when self-insuring and the opportunity to mitigate that risk by purchasing stop-loss insurance. The model makes use of a structural, utility maximization framework to account for numerous aspects of the firm decision, and a multinomial probit to reproduce the elasticity of the firm's demand for health insurance. Findings and Conclusions Our simulations provide three important conclusions. First, they project significant increases in self-insurance rates among small firms - presumably induced by the desire to avoid ACA's rate-banding and risk adjustment regulations - only if generous stop-loss policies become widely available. Second, they show that this increase would be due to this hypothetical adoption of widespread, generous reinsurance by the market and not by passage of the ACA. Third, even with a substantial increase of self-insurance rates among small firms, they project negligible adverse selection in the exchanges, as indicated by our finding that the increase in exchange premium is less than 0.5% when assuming very generous stop-loss policies after implementation of the ACA. © Health Research and Educational Trust."

The Social Security Amendments of 1967 established the program of early and periodic screening, diagnosis and treatment (EPSDT) as a required Medicaid benefit. The EPSDT amendments directed agencies to cover ""early and periodic"" screening and diagnostic services to ascertain ""defects"" and ""chronic conditions"" in children, as well as health care and treatment needed to ""correct or ameliorate"" such defects and conditions discovered during the screening examinations. The 1997 enactment of the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) shifted federal policy from the use of an early coverage standard to one that gives insurers much more discretion to define medical necessity and coverage exclusions. CHIP programs offer coverage that is narrower than the benefits available under Medicaid. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) requires significantly more classes of care to be covered than does CHIP but well below the level of coverage under Medicaid. Implementation of the ACA to date suggests that the US Department of Health and Human Services will only demand pediatric coverage pegged to the commercial insurance market standards, rather than Medicaid's unique pediatric coverage standard. Although EPSDT's emphasis on early, developmental, and ameliorative services might result in more comprehensive benefits for children, particularly those with special health needs, one might still describe the ACA coverage as providing a basic, minimal level of services from a distributive justice perspective. It may, however, vary from state to state. States have the authority to decide whether to use an EPSDT-style approach or to follow the more restrictive approach of commercial insurance plans. Advocacy at the state level will determine which approach different states take. Copyright © 2013 by the American Academy of Pediatrics."

Health reforms in Switzerland and the Netherlands in 1996 and 2006, respectively, created managed competition in the countries' health insurance markets, which are somewhat analogous to the US state and federally operated health insurance exchanges scheduled to begin operations in 2013 under the Affordable Care Act. We review the Swiss and Dutch experience with exchanges and offer specific lessons for the US exchanges. First, risk-adjustment mechanisms-which provide premium adjustments intended to compensate health plans for enrolling people expected to have high medical costs-need to be sophisticated and continually updated. Second, it is important to determine why people eligible for coverage don't enroll and to craft responses that will overcome enrollment barriers. Third, applying for subsidies must be simple. Fourth, insurers will need bargaining power similar to that of providers to create a level playing field for negotiating about prices and quality of services, and interim cost containment measures may be necessary. Fifth and finally, insurers and consumers alike will need meaningful information about providers' costs and quality of care so they can become prudent purchasers of health services, since managed competition among health plans by itself will not substantially drive down health costs. © 2013 Project HOPE-The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc."

Study Design: Retrospective data analysis based on pharmacy claims data from a national pharmacy benefit manager. Methods: We used a difference-in-difference-indifference method to evaluate the impact of coverage gap reform on adherence to diabetes medications. Two cohorts (2010 and 2011) were constructed to represent the last year before Affordable Care Act (ACA) reform and the first year after reform, respectively. Each patient had 2 observations: 1 before and 1 after entering the coverage gap. Patients in each cohort were divided into groups based on type of gap coverage: no coverage, partial coverage (generics only), and full coverage. Results: Following ACA reform, patients with no gap coverage and patients with partial gap coverage experienced substantial drops in copayments in the coverage gap in 2011. Their adherence to diabetes medications in the gap, measured by percentage of days covered, improved correspondingly (2.99 percentage points, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.49-5.48, P = .019 for patients with no coverage; 6.46 percentage points, 95% CI 3.34-9.58, P <.0001 for patients with partial coverage). Patients with full coverage also had lower copayments in the gap in 2011. However, their adherence did not increase (-0.13 percentage point, P = .8011). Conclusions: In the first year of ACA coverage gap reform, copayments in the gap decreased substantially for all patients. Patients with no coverage and patients with partial coverage in the gap had better adherence in the gap in 2011."

Data Sources 2002-2009 Annual Social and Economic Supplements of the Current Population Survey linked to data from multiple secondary data sources. Study Design We use a selection correction model to simultaneously estimate program eligibility and coverage outcomes conditional upon eligibility. We simulate the effects of three premium schedules representing a range of generosity levels and the effects of income eligibility thresholds ranging from 200 to 400 percent of the federal poverty line. Principal Findings Premium contribution requirements decrease enrollment in public coverage and increase enrollment in private coverage, with larger effects for greater contribution levels. Our simulation results suggest minimal changes in coverage outcomes from eligibility expansions to higher income families under premium schedules that require more than a modest contribution (medium or high schedules). Conclusions Our simulation results are useful counterpoints to previous research that has estimated the average effect of program expansions as they were implemented without disentangling the effects of premiums or other program features. The sensitivity to premiums observed suggests that although contribution requirements may be effective in reducing crowd-out, they also have the potential, depending on the level of contribution required, to nullify the effects of CHIP expansions entirely. The persistence of uninsurance among children under the range of simulated scenarios points to the importance of Affordable Care Act provisions designed to make the process of obtaining coverage transparent and navigable. © Health Research and Educational Trust."

However, an overlooked area of general fitness has been the importance of oral health. Dental caries and periodontal disease are among the most common chronic diseases that disproportionately affect the most vulnerable populations. Despite significant progress in preventing and managing these oral diseases, there is a large segment of the population that have not experienced the same gains. This paper seeks to begin to fill this gap by identifying key epidemiological, professional and ethical issues related to social justice and oral health. Disparities of oral disease and access to oral health care in the United States will be addressed by examining questions and issues related to social justice. Critical problems are identified, including inadequate financial resources, a disjointed infrastructure of care, separation from the general medical care system, and poor understanding of important oral health determinants. Furthermore, if oral health is integral to one's overall health and general well-being, then the concept of a basic human right should be entertained. Faith-based groups could provide a link for bridging this disparity gap in oral health among their parishioners through active listening, advocacy and targeted educational programs. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC."

The new legislation provides federal funding for center expansion, increased Medicaid enrollment, enhanced Medicare payments, training to increase primary care providers, and incentives to develop CHCs as accountable care organizations. Health reform could place CHCs in a vulnerable financial situation. Newly insured patients may seek care at private providers, whereas CHCs are left caring only for the uninsured. Thus, CHCs are unable to benefit from enhanced insurance payments needed to offset care given to the uninsured. Conversely, if CHCs participate in developing comprehensive care networks for low-income populations by strengthening referral networks, developing primary medical care homes and accountable care organizations, and investing in infrastructure, then health center medical care will be a desired option for the newly insured, and a robust safety-net system may result. © 2013 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins."

As a new model of healthcare delivery, the Accountable Care Organization (ACO) offers potential opportunities for addressing the healthcare needs of rural populations, yet little is known about how the ACO model will meet the needs of RHCs. This article reports on the results of a survey, focus groups, and phone interviews with RHC management personnel on the subject of benefits of and barriers to RHC participation in ACOs. Survey research, focus groups, and phone interviews were used to gather and analyze the opinions of RHCs' management about the benefits of and barriers to ACO participation. The study population consisted of all 2011 RHCs in Region 4 (Southeastern USA; as designated by the Department of Health and Human Services). California RHCs were used for comparison. Themes and concepts for the survey questionnaire were developed from recent literature. The survey data were analyzed in two stages: (1) analyses of the characteristics of the RHCs and their responses; and (2) bivariate analyses of several relationships using a variety of statistics including analysis of variance, Pearson's &amp;#967;2 and likelihood &amp;#967;2. Relationships were examined between the RHCs' willingness to join ACOs and the respondent clinic's classification (as provider-based or independent). In addition, willingness to join ACOs among Region 4 RHCs was compared with those in California. Finally, in order to gain a broader understanding of the results of the survey, focus groups and phone interviews were conducted with RHC personnel. It was found that the&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;ACO model is generally unfamiliar to RHCs. Approximately 48% of the survey respondents reported having little knowledge of ACOs; the focus group participants and interviewees likewise reported a lack of knowledge. Among respondents who were knowledgeable about ACOs, the most frequently citied potential benefit of ACOs (58%) was improved patient quality of care, followed by a focus on the patient (54%). More than half of the respondents (53%) cited 'financing' as a deterrent to RHC participating in ACOs. Many (43%) reported that their clinic had inadequate capital to improve their information technology systems. Another 51% cited legal and regulatory barriers. While the ACO model was unfamiliar to many of the RHC study participants, many suggested that ACOs may promote the quality of health care for RHC patients and their communities. If, on the other hand, RHCs are not provided the necessary technical assistance or not valued as ACO partners, ACOs may not improve the services that RHCs provide. As the ACO model evolves, the authors will determine whether it will benefit RHCs and their patients, or how the ACO must be modified to accommodate the unique needs of RHCs."

This research study examined the characteristics of NPs working in NMHCs and measured job satisfaction and perceived level of autonomy. No studies about job satisfaction or autonomy for NPs working in NMHCs had been previously reported. Data sources: This descriptive, quantitative study surveyed primary care NPs working in NMHCs that are part of the National Nursing Centers Consortium (NNCC). NP e-mail addresses were obtained from NNCC center directors. Of 198 NPs invited to the electronic survey, 99 completed the Misener Nurse Practitioner Job Satisfaction Scale, demographic questionnaire, questions about perceived autonomy, and whether they would recommend working in an NMHC. Participants came from 16 states and 46 NMHCs. Conclusions: NPs working in NMHCs have job satisfaction, perceive their role as autonomous, and are satisfied with the autonomy they have. Implications for practice: NMHCs can provide access to primary health care for many Americans.

Roberts had mixed success during his first years on the bench, as the Court handed down a series of highpro file decisions by polarized, 5-4 votes. In the health care decision, however, Roberts did precisely what he said he would do, casting a tie-breaking vote to uphold the Affordable Care Act because he thought the bipartisan legitimacy of the Court required it. But the reaction to the health care decision-which Democrats approved and Republicans did not-suggests that Roberts's task of preserving the Court's bipartisan legitimacy is more complicated than he may have imagined, and that his success in the future will depend on the willingness of his colleagues to embrace his vision. Given the Court's declining approval ratings, an increase in partisan attacks on the Court, and a growing perception that the Court decides cases based on politics rather than law, the Chief Justice's vision of the Court as a bipartisan steward is more difficult-and also more urgently needed-than ever. © 2013 by Jeffrey Rosen."

Nevertheless, it remains the second most common cause of cancer death amongst men and women combined in U.S. Most cases of colon cancer are diagnosed at a late stage leading to poor survival outcomes for patients. After extensive research of publically available data, it would appear that the state of Connecticut does not have available state-wide data on patient wait times for routine colonoscopy screening. Furthermore, there are no publicly available, or Connecticut-specific, reports on Medicaid participation rates for colorectal screening amongst gastroenterologists (GI) in Connecticut. In 2012, the American Cancer Society report on Colorectal Cancer Screening Rates confirmed barriers to health-care access and disparities in health outcomes and survival rates for colon cancer patients based on race, ethnicity, and low socioeconomic status. Given this information, one could conjecture that low Medicaid participation rates among GIs could potentially have a more severe impact on health-care access and outcomes for underserved populations. At present, funding and human resources are being employed across the state of Connecticut to address bottlenecks in colorectal cancer screening. More specifically, pa-tient navigation and outreach programs are emerging and expandingto address the gaps in services for hardto-reach populations and the medically underserved. LowMedicaid participation rates and increased wait times for colonoscopy screening may impair the efficacy of colorectal cancer patient navigation and outreach efforts and potentially funding for future interventions. In this study, we report the results of our secret-shopper telephone survey comprising of 73 group and independent gastroenterologist (GI) practices in different counties of Connecticut. Methods: Reviewing online resources and yellow pages, researchers compiled a county-specific list of GI practices throughout Connecticut and conducted a secret-shopper survey by telephone. A standard script and set of questions was formulated and used for each telephone call to GI practices. Data was analyzed in context of statistics available to the public at large from the U.S. Census Bureau. Results: Overall, 46% of all 93 practices and 62% of individual GIs from all 93 practices state-wide reported Medicaid participation. About 35% of surveyed practices were independent practices; 41% of these reported Medicaid participation. About 65% of surveyed practices were group practices; 49% of these reported Medicaid participation. Approximately, 85% of all practices are in Fairfield, Hartford, or New Haven counties. Of all three counties, New Haven reported the highest Medicaid participation rate by practices; 62% of all practices in New Haven reported participation. Fairfield reported the lowest Medicaid participation rate by practices; 29% of all practices in Fairfield reported participation. When Medicaid participation rates were calculated for total number of gastroenterologists from all practices in a given county (as opposed to participation ratesby number of practices),Medicaid participation rates were 80% and 44% for New Haven and Fairfield, respectively. Of all practices in Hartford, only 50% reported Medicaid participation, whereas 67% of the total number of gastroenterologists (as opposed to practices) reported Medicaid participation. According to a recent national survey, 47% of gastroenterologists reported stopping accepting new Medicaid patients. Overall minimum and maximum wait times were reported to be the highest for Hartford, but wait times were long even for smaller counties, reflecting a possible imbalance in supply and demand or inefficiency in allocating the available resources. Conclusion: Only a limited number of gastroenterology practices in Connecticut accept Medicaid patients, notablyin selected counties, but in all counties, and this may add to access barriers. It is yet unclear whether these disparities are significant enough to create a supply-demand imbalance and thus, have a significantly negative impact on health outcomes for the underserved. Nevertheless, with the high unemployment rates and impending implementation of mandated state-wide health-care reform as outlined in the Affordable Care Act, the Medicaid population in the state of Connecticut will increase, increasing future demand for services. In addition, based on the survey findings, longer wait times for colonoscopy screening are reported for the many of GI practices in Connecticut for Medicaid-insured as well as non-Medicaid patients. Longer wait times may have an impact on patient compliance, especially for the underserved populations that are hard to reach and ensure follow-up, contributingto potential delayed diagnosis. A Medicaid-associated disparity in this area will serve to exacerbate the problem for the underserved compared to those relatively well served. Those currently not seeking screening are at even higher risk of contributing to the higher mortality rate, and we need to find out how best to ensure that we can more uniformly apply screening and have the capacity to do so."

The behavior of such facilities is likely to change under the Affordable Care Act. We modeled how accountable care reform may affect the financial standing of PBT centers and their incentives to treat complex patient cases. Methods and Materials: We used operational data and publicly listed Medicare rates to model the relationship between financial metrics for PBT center performance and case mix (defined as the percentage of complex cases, such as pediatric central nervous system tumors). Financial metrics included total daily revenues and debt coverage (daily revenues - daily debt payments). Fee-for-service (FFS) and accountable care (ACO) reimbursement scenarios were modeled. Sensitivity analyses were performed around the room time required to treat noncomplex cases: simple (30 minutes), prostate (24 minutes), and short prostate (15 minutes). Sensitivity analyses were also performed for total machine operating time (14, 16, and 18 h/d). Results: Reimbursement under ACOs could reduce daily revenues in PBT centers by up to 32%. The incremental revenue gained by replacing 1 complex case with noncomplex cases was lowest for simple cases and highest for short prostate cases. ACO rates reduced this incremental incentive by 53.2% for simple cases and 41.7% for short prostate cases. To cover daily debt payments after ACO rates were imposed, 26% fewer complex patients were allowable at varying capital costs and interest rates. Only facilities with total machine operating times of 18 hours per day would cover debt payments in all scenarios. Conclusions: Debt-financed PBT centers will face steep challenges to remain financially viable after ACO implementation. Paradoxically, reduced reimbursement for noncomplex cases will require PBT centers to treat more such cases over cases for which PBT has demonstrated superior outcomes. Relative losses will be highest for those facilities focused primarily on treating noncomplex cases. © 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

Assessments of the adequacy of physician supply often focus on three dimensions of the physician population: its size; its composition (e.g., the mix between primary care and specialty physicians); and its geographic distribution. Policies that aim to alter physician supply generally focus on both current and future supply along these three dimensions because physician training is a lengthy process; therefore, changes implemented to alter supply do not have immediate effects. Each of the three dimensions of physician supply is important for health care spending and for population health because physician clinical decisions affect approximately 90% of each health care dollar spent. In addition, as physicians provide health care services that, with some exceptions, cannot be provided by non-physicians, the size, composition, and geographic distribution of the physician population affects the amount and type of health care services available. A number of studies have found physician shortages overall, in certain specialties, and in certain geographic areas. The federal government pays for physician services, primarily through the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and supports physician training through a number of programs in various departments and agencies. Given current investments in physician services and the physician workforce, the adequacy of the current and future physician supply may be of interest to Congress. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA, P.L. 111-148) may affect physician supply because it expands insurance coverage to those previously uninsured. PPACA also includes provisions that may affect the size, composition, and geographic distribution of the physician population by supporting changes to physician training, compensation, and practice. Specifically, provisions targeting the number of physicians trained and their productivity may affect the size of the physician population. The composition of the physician population may be altered by provisions targeting the supply of primary care providers or specialties in shortage. Provisions addressing the diversity of the physician workforce and those incentivizing practice in rural or other underserved areas may affect the geographic distribution of the physician population. Finally, PPACA includes provisions that provide for data collection and evaluation of the adequacy of the workforce in general, and federal workforce programs specifically. Whether and how these provisions will affect physician supply is not yet known because some of these provisions have not been implemented yet, are temporary, will not have immediate effects, or rely on discretionary funding. This report examines each dimension of physician supply, separately discussing current (and, where appropriate, future) concerns and relevant changes included in PPACA that may affect each dimension. The report then discusses workforce planning activities included in PPACA that may affect all three dimensions of supply. © 2013 Nova Science Publishers, Inc."

In the aggregate, insurers paid less than 1 percent of premiums on either MLR rebates or quality improvement activities in 2011, with amounts varying by insurer type. Publicly traded insurers had significantly lower MLRs in each market segment (individual, small group, and large group), and were more likely to owe a rebate in most segments compared with non-publicly traded insurers. The median quality improvement expenditure per member among nonprofit and provider-sponsored insurers was more than the median among for-profit and non-provider-sponsored insurers."

The resulting Alzheimer's Association Medicare Annual Wellness Visit Algorithm for Assessment of Cognition includes review of patient Health Risk Assessment (HRA) information, patient observation, unstructured queries during the AWV, and use of structured cognitive assessment tools for both patients and informants.

The intervention, which began in 2005, was associated with a 41 percent decrease, relative to a comparison group, in hospitalizations for conditions targeted by the wellness program but with no significant decrease in other hospitalizations. We found reductions in inpatient costs but similar increases in non-inpatient costs.

Recognizing the risk that unhealthy employees might be punished rather than helped by such programs, the act also forbids health-based discrimination. We reviewed results of randomized controlled trials and identified challenges for workplace wellness programs to function as the act intends. For example, research results raise doubts that employees with health risk factors, such as obesity and tobacco use, spend more on medical care than others. Such groups may not be especially promising targets for financial incentives meant to save costs through health improvement. Although there may be other valid reasons, beyond lowering costs, to institute workplace wellness programs, we found little evidence that such programs can easily save costs through health improvement without being discriminatory.

This contributes to increased incidences of overweight and obesity. Implementing policies that require restaurants to disclose nutrition information has the potential to improve nutrition knowledge and food behaviors. The purpose of this paper was to examine the potential health benefits of nutrient menu labeling in restaurants, the progress of this legislation and to provide results regarding the implementation of these policies. Data sources were obtained from a search of multiple databases including PubMed, Science Direct, Academic Search Premier, and Google Scholar. Study inclusion criteria were publication in the past ten years, obesity prevention, and utilization of nutrition labeling on menus in restaurants. The initial policies to provide consumers with nutrition information in restaurant settings began at the state levels in 2006. These laws demonstrated success, other states followed, and a national law was passed and is being implemented. Mandating nutrient menu disclosure has the potential to influence a large number of people; this legislation has the opportunity to impact Americans who dine at a fast food or chain restaurant. Given the growing obesity epidemic, continued research is necessary to gauge the effectiveness of this new law and its effects on the health status of the American people."

Using a web-based survey, participants were randomly assigned to one of four menus which differed only in their labeling schemes (n=802): (1) a menu with no nutritional information, (2) a menu with calorie information, (3) a menu with calorie information and minutes to walk to burn those calories, or (4) a menu with calorie information and miles to walk to burn those calories. There was a significant difference in the mean number of calories ordered based on menu type (p=0.02), with an average of 1020 calories ordered from a menu with no nutritional information, 927 calories ordered from a menu with only calorie information, 916 calories ordered from a menu with both calorie information and minutes to walk to burn those calories, and 826 calories ordered from the menu with calorie information and the number of miles to walk to burn those calories. The menu with calories and the number of miles to walk to burn those calories appeared the most effective in influencing the selection of lower calorie meals (p=0.0007) when compared to the menu with no nutritional information provided. The majority of participants (82%) reported a preference for physical activity based menu labels over labels with calorie information alone and no nutritional information. Whether these labels are effective in real-life scenarios remains to be tested. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd."

On the other hand, concerns about liability could stymie development and implementation. We categorize legal developments concerning patient decision aids into the following five sections: 1.

An employer's liability under the mandate, and the scope of penalties, depends on the number of the employer's full-time employees. If the employer hires only full-time workers, it is not difficult to count them. But if the employer has seasonal or part-time workers, determining the number of full-time employees and the potential penalties is more difficult. This column discusses regulatory guidance provided by the government that explains how such determinations can be made. It also discusses how to coordinate the rules for determining employee status with the prohibition on waiting periods of more than 90 days."

First, small employers with predominantly low-income employees may tend to opt out of small group markets because their employees will be better off with subsidized individual coverage. Second, small employers with employees of heterogeneous income levels will have strong incentives to offer coverage that is either ""unaffordable"" or fails to provide ""minimum value"" in order to preserve the availability of government subsidies for their low-income employees. Finally, small employers that continue to offer group plans will face increased incentives to self-insure those plans, further contracting small group markets and subjecting them to adverse selection. Collectively, these forces may destabilize small group markets and increase the ACA's fiscal cost. We therefore conclude by offering various reforms aimed at offsetting these risks and preserving the viability of small group markets. © Risk Management and Insurance Review, 2013."

Increasingly, they are being recognized for their relationship to the soaring incidence of Type 2 diabetes in the US, as well as the opportunities they present for us to counter it. Many current Type 2 diabetes interventions focus on biologic and behavioral factors, such as symptoms, diet, and physical activity. However, it is equally important to address the influence of physical and social environments, which may include low income, employment insecurity, low educational attainment, and poor living conditions, on health outcomes. Section 4302 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 offers an opportunity to improve data collection and policy development to more effectively identify populations at high risk for developing Type 2 diabetes and to proactively refer them to appropriate social support services that may ultimately support reduction of health disparities. Expanding the scope of this legislation to include data that incorporate social determinants would improve the ability of clinicians and health systems to engage and to treat patients with chronic conditions, such as Type 2 diabetes, while expanding policymakers' ability to conform to the legislation's intent of shaping efforts to reduce chronic conditions nationwide."

But a new form of this foundational practice is being implemented with increasing frequency: the delegation to agencies of the power to waive requirements that Congress itself has passed. It appears, among other places, as a central feature of two signature statutes of the last decade, the No Child Left Behind Act and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. We call this delegation of the power to unmake major statutory provisions ""big waiver"". This Article examines the basic structure and theory of big waiver, its operation in various regulatory contexts, and its constitutional and policy implications. While delegation by Congress of the power to unmake the law it makes raises concerns, we conclude the emergence of big waiver represents a salutary development. By allowing Congress to take ownership of a detailed statutory regime-even one it knows may be waived-big waiver allows Congress to codify policy preferences it might otherwise be unwilling to enact. Furthermore, by enabling Congress to stipulate a baseline against which agencies' subsequent actions are measured, big waiver offers a sorely needed means by which Congress and the executive branch may overcome gridlock. And finally, in a world laden with federal statutes, big waiver provides Congress a valuable tool for freeing the exercise of new delegations of authority from prior constraints and updating legislative frameworks that have grown stale. We welcome this new phase of the administrative process."

However, little is known about how adherence to recommendations by the American Academy of Pediatrics for well-child visits has changed over time. Using the 1996-2008 Medical Expenditure Panel Surveys, we examined trends in adherence and whether differences across population subgroups narrowed or widened over time. We found that the ratio of actual to recommended well-child visits rose from 46.3 percent during the 1996-98 time period to 58.9 percent during the 2007-08 time period. Although this increase in adherence is important, improvement occurred unevenly. We observed large differences in adherence at the start of the study period across income, race or ethnicity, parent education, region, insurance coverage, and having a usual source of care. None of these differences had narrowed significantly by the end of the study period. Indeed, differences widened across parent education, between those with and without insurance coverage, by usual source of care, and between the Northeast and the Midwest and West regions.

While recent changes to Internal Revenue Service (IRS) reporting requirements have improved transparency, the lack of clearly defined charitable expectations has resulted in critical scrutiny of not-for-profit hospitals' community benefits and numerous challenges to their tax exempt status. Using data from the revised IRS Form 990 Schedule H for 2009, this article documents the wide range of community benefit activities that not-for-profit hospitals in California engage in and compares them to a set of minimum spending thresholds. The findings show that when community benefit was defined narrowly in terms of charity care, very few hospitals would have met any of the minimum spending thresholds. When community benefit was defined as in the revised IRS Form 990 Schedule H, however, a majority of hospitals in California would have been considered charitable. Whether focusing on expenditures is the most appropriate way to assess the adequacy of a hospital's community benefits remains an open question.

The GME Initiative recommends Congress (1) invigorates primary care physician (PCP) supply through GME benchmarking and enforcement by creating a workforce that is at least 40% PCPs, holding teaching hospitals accountable, and increasing the primary care residency position cap, (2) establishes a GME system supported by all insurers-public and private-and implements a fixed floor funding of direct GME (DME) at $100,000 per resident per year for residencies that produce graduates who truly go on to practice primary care, (3) reallocates some indirect GME (IME) to support primary care residency education, including enhanced PCP education outside hospitals, including teaching health centers, (4) restores funding for the 1997 full-time equivalent (FTE) PCP residency slots cut for training outside the teaching hospital, (5) allows states expanding Medicaid through the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) to increase PCP education capacity through Medicaid DME and/or IME at the enhanced Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP)."

The moves are part of a broader trend toward consolidation in health care, with the overall number of mergers and acquisitions in the sector at the highest level in a decade. Alterations in physician practice appear to be a response to a number of factors. Younger doctors are more eager than their predecessors to work for an outside institution, such as a hospital, to secure a set schedule and salary. Private practices have become more complex to manage, even as physician compensation has been declining. Doctors see financial advantages to building larger practices, in terms of ability to control expenses and negotiate higher fees with insurers. Further, not all trends are toward consolidation. A small but growing number of doctors are reacting to market incentives by moving in a different direction: creating concierge practices in which they see a limited number of patients who pay an annual retainer. According to experts, physician practices also may be affected, in part, by provisions of the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA, P.L. 111-148, as amended), designed to spur closer financial and clinical affiliation among health care providers. For example, the ACA creates health care delivery systems called Accountable Care Organizations (ACO), under which providers contract to oversee a patient's total course of care in a bid to manage costs and improve quality. A number of physician practices, insurers, and hospitals have announced affiliations to qualify as ACOs. In another move partly spurred by the ACA, hospitals and health plans have been hiring physicians to ensure they will have adequate staff to treat the millions of Americans projected to gain insurance during the next few years. Several major studies have warned of a looming shortage of physicians, particularly primary care doctors. Congress is playing dual roles regarding the consolidation. On the one hand, the ACA was designed, in part, to prompt affiliation among doctors and other health care providers in order to reduce fragmentation and help control government and private health spending. At the same time, lawmakers are monitoring the health care system for signs that consolidation is having negative effects on consumer access, prices, and competition. The health care sector went through a similar round of restructuring during the 1980s and 1990s, including mergers and acquisitions of physician practices, ultimately prompting a backlash from some consumers who complained they were being blocked from specialists and procedures. The ACA envisions a different system of ""patient-centered care,"" where doctors and other providers are given incentives to improve quality and efficiency, rather than to limit services. Still, it remains to be seen how the current round of changes will play out as physicians and other providers form larger organizations. This report provides background on factors contributing to changes in physician practice organization, including physician supply, sources of revenue, operating costs, and government incentives. It also examines the different types of integration, the legal intricacies of affiliation, and the possible implications for consumer and federal policy. © 2013 Nova Science Publishers, Inc."

These disparities highlight a critical public health concern because the majority of SUD patients in the United States are treated in the publicly funded treatment sector. This study uses recent data to examine disparities in access to physicians and availability of medications for the treatment of SUDs between publicly and privately funded SUD treatment programs. Method: Data were collected from 595 specialty SUD treatment programs from 2007 to 2010 via face-to-face interviews, mailed surveys, and telephone interviews with treatment program administrators. Results: Publicly funded programs were less likely than privately funded programs to have a physician on staff, even after controlling for several organizational characteristics that were associated with access to physicians. The results of negative binomial regression indicated that, even after taking into account physician access and other organizational variables, publicly funded programs prescribed fewer SUD medications than privately funded SUD treatment programs. Conclusions: Patients seeking treatment in publicly funded treatment programs continue to face disparities in access to high-quality SUD treatment that supports patients' choices among a range of medication options. However, implementation of the Affordable Care Act may facilitate greater access to physicians and use of medications in publicly funded SUD treatment programs."

Many Americans lack health care insurance of any kind, and many others with insurance are nonetheless exposed to financial risk because of high premiums, deductibles, co-pays, limits on insurance payments, and uncovered services. One might expect that the U.S. poverty measure would capture these financial effects and trends in them over time. Yet the current official poverty measure developed in the early 1960s does not take into account significant increases and variations in medical care costs, insurance coverage, out-of-pocket spending, and the financial burden imposed on families and individuals. Although medical costs consume a growing share of family and national income and studies regularly document high rates of medical financial stress and debt, the current poverty measure does not capture the consequences for families' economic security or their income available for other basic needs. In 1995, a panel of the National Research Council (NRC) recommended a new poverty measure, which compares families' disposable income to poverty thresholds based on current spending for food, clothing, shelter, utilities, and a little more. The panel's recommendations stimulated extensive collaborative research involving several government agencies on experimental poverty measures that led to a new research Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM), which the U.S. Census Bureau first published in November 2011 and will update annually. Analyses of the effects of including and excluding certain factors from the new SPM showed that, were it not for the cost that families incurred for premiums and other medical expenses not covered by health insurance, 10 million fewer people would have been poor according to the SPM. The implementation of the patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) provides a strong impetus to think rigorously about ways to measure medical care economic burden and risk, which is the basis for Medical Care Economic Risk. As new policies - whether part of the ACA or other policies - are implemented that seek to expand and improve health insurance coverage and to protect against the high costs of medical care relative to income, such measures will be important to assess the effects of policy changes in both the short and long term on the extent of financial burden and risk for the population, which are explained in this report. © 2012 by the National Academy of Sciences.

Study Design: A decision-Analytic model was developed to compare the costs and outcomes of the current versus the proposed plan for contraceptive coverage (Federal Poverty Level=185% vs. 399%, respectively) over 5 years. The perspective adopted was that of Oregon state insurance providers. The primary outcomes were number of pregnancies averted, health costs and quality adjusted life years (QALYs). Contraceptive failure rates, costs, projected insurance coverage, contraception use and pregnancy outcome data were obtained from the published literature. Sensitivity analyses were performed for all variables. Results: Extending contraceptive coverage both saves money and improves outcomes for Oregon state insurance plan providers. The proposed policy would prevent an additional 72 pregnancies per 1000 women over 5 years. Extending coverage is cost-effective, saving an additional $489 per woman enrolled over 5 years while increasing QALYs.

The analysis finds that, to date, only one state passed new legislation on all of these protections, and an additional 10 states and the District of Columbia passed new legislation or issued a new regulation on at least one protection. The analysis also finds that--without new legislation--some states face limitations in fully enforcing these reforms.

We found that some federally supported programs made substantial progress in supporting and empowering patients by reorienting state agencies to become active advocates for their citizens. Yet progress across the country was inconsistent, and there was little evidence that programs addressed systemic problems experienced by consumers. On balance, the consumer assistance provisions of health carereform do not yet ensure protection for all privately insured Americans because of uneven implementation-a problem likely to be of further concern as coverage is expanded and health insurance exchanges come online in 2014.

However, it still remains unclear how Essential Health Benefits will be described and specifically what, if any, reproductive services will be included. Beyond the exchanges low income individuals will have access to the expansion in Medicaid occurring in many states starting also in 2014. Each state Medicaid program is responsible for describing their extent of coverage for reproductive services. Already in place affecting many younger individuals in need of reproductive services is the Dependent 26 provision, which provides coverage to dependents up to the age of 26 under a guardian's insurance. These provisions of the Affordable Care Act may increase access to reproductive services for many individuals previously uninsured or underinsured. © Journal of Reproductive Medicine®, Inc."

Methods: We conducted an experiment to determine if more aggressive media fact-checking could correct the false belief that the Affordable Care Act would create ""death panels."" Participants from an opt-in Internet panel were randomly assigned to either a control group in which they read an article on Sarah Palin's claims about ""death panels"" or an intervention group in which the article also contained corrective information refuting Palin. Findings: The correction reduced belief in death panels and strong opposition to the reform bill among those who view Palin unfavorably and those who view her favorably but have low political knowledge. However, it backfired among politically knowledgeable Palin supporters, who were more likely to believe in death panels and to strongly oppose reform if they received the correction. Conclusions: These results underscore the difficulty of reducing misperceptions about health care reform among individuals with the motivation and sophistication to reject corrective information. © 2012 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins."

It is unclear how this legislation will affect their access to employer-sponsored health insurance (ESI). We describe the health insurance experiences for survivors of childhood cancer with and without ESI. Methods: We conducted a series of qualitative interviews with 32 adult survivors from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study to assess their employment-related concerns and decisions regarding health insurance coverage. Interviews were performed from August to December 2009 and were recorded, transcribed, and content analyzed using NVivo 8. Results: Uninsured survivors described ongoing employment limitations, such as being employed at part-time capacity, which affected their access to ESI coverage. These survivors acknowledged they could not afford insurance without employer support. Survivors on ESI had previously been denied health insurance due to their preexisting health conditions until they obtained coverage through an employer. Survivors feared losing their ESI coverage, which created a disincentive to making career transitions. Others reported worries about insurance rescission if their cancer history was discovered. Survivors on ESI reported financial barriers in their ability to pay for health care. Conclusions: Childhood cancer survivors face barriers to obtaining ESI. While ACA provisions may mitigate insurance barriers for cancer survivors, many will still face cost barriers to affording health care without employer support. © 2012 Springer-Verlag."

Nothing this big happens overnight and without controversy. Numerous concerns were raised from all demographics and from both sides of the political aisle. Some of the concerns were legal questions regarding constitutionality and so legal processes began to address this issue. In June 2012, the Supreme Court decided in a 5-4 vote that the Act is constitutional. This has allowed the legislation to stand and over the next few years the more transforming parts will start to be implemented. It is important to understand the issues surrounding the Supreme Court decision and the impact this may have on health care and specifically the practice of neurology.

When trying to determine what services are covered, an individual may have to wade through multiple plan documents and interpret unfamiliar language. Even if a consumer does make such an effort, they may be unable to really understand the terms of their coverage. In an attempt to make insurance a little more understandable, Congress created the Uniform Glossary in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010. This document contains approximately two dozen commonly used insurance terms with easy-to-understand definitions. Every enrollee will receive the Uniform Glossary along with official plan documents, but the terms and definitions are not plan-specific and are not legally binding. Therefore, any given definition in the Uniform Glossary could be entirely different from the actual definition used by the insurer. This Note proposes that the Uniform Glossary provision is ineffective in its current state, particularly as it relates to employer-sponsored insurance. Although Congress explicitly intended the Uniform Glossary to be an informational tool and not binding on the terms of coverage, its intent will be meaningless if consumers cannot rely on those definitions to understand their health insurance coverage. In order to create a truly accessible marketplace, Congress must require insurance plans to use the terms as defined in the Uniform Glossary in all plan documents. This will put consumers in a position to adequately assess the terms of their insurance coverage, to make better-informed purchasing decisions when seeking medical treatment, and to participate in a more efficient and transparent marketplace."

Blacks have higher rates of such hospitalizations than whites. The 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) seeks to implement higher quality health care, which may help close the racial gap in these rates. The objective of this study was to analyze pre- PPACA baseline rates of preventable hypertension hospitalizations in the United States and racial differences over time. Methods: We used data from the 1995-2010 National Hospital Discharge Survey, a stratified, probability-designed survey representing approximately 1% of hospitalizations in the United States. Rates were calculated using specifications published by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality requiring census data as denominators for the rates. We combined at least 3 years of data to obtain more precise estimates and conducted a trend analysis by using rates calculated for each of the resulting 5 periods. Results: For both sexes, all age groups, and each period, blacks had higher crude rates than whites. Age- and sex-standardized rates confirmed this finding (eg, 2007-2010: blacks, 334 per 100,000; whites, 97.4 per 100,000). Rates were generally flat over time; however, white women aged 65 or older showed increasing rates. Conclusion: Using national data, we confirmed higher rates of preventable hypertension hospitalizations for blacks, showing little improvement in disparities over time. This pre-PPACA baseline for blacks and whites allows for ongoing monitoring of preventable hospitalizations for hypertension."

More than 1.3 million California HMO enrollees ages 18 to 64 do not speak English well enough to communicate with medical providers and may experience reduced access to high-quality health care if they do not receive appropriate language assistance services. Based on analysis of the 2007 and 2009 California Health Interview Surveys (CHIS), commercial HMO enrollees with limited English proficiency (LEP) in poorer health are more likely to have difficulty understanding their doctors, placing this already vulnerable population at even greater risk. The analysis also uses CHIS to examine the potential impact of health plan monitoring starting in 2009 (due to a 2003 amendment to the Knox-Keene Health Care Services Act) requiring health plans to provide free qualified interpretation and translation services to HMO enrollees. The authors recommend that California's health plans continue to incorporate trained interpreters into their contracted networks and delivery systems, paying special attention to enrollees in poorer health. The results may serve as a planning tool for health plans, providing a detailed snapshot of enrollee characteristics that will help design effective programs now and prepare for a likely increase in insured LEP populations in the future, as full implementation of the Affordable Care Act takes place over the next decade."

To fill that gap, this study examines how R&D spending is influenced by prior year cash flow and corporate market value using multiple regression analysis and a panel data set of medical device companies over the period 1962-2008. The empirical findings suggest that the elasticities of R&D spending with respect to cash flow and corporate market value equal 0.58 and 0.31, respectively. Moreover, based upon these estimates, simulations show that the recently enacted excise tax on medical devices, taken alone, will reduce R&D spending by approximately $4 billion and thereby lead to a minimum loss of $20 billion worth of human life years over the first 10 years of its enactment.

Such plans are complex and do not easily fit into the simplified, consumer-friendly comparison tools that many state health insurance exchanges are formulating for use in 2014. Nevertheless some states and plans are attempting to strike the right balance between a streamlined health exchange shopping experience and innovative, albeit complex, benefit design that promotes value. For example, agencies administering exchanges in Vermont and Oregon are contemplating offering value-based insurance plans as an option in addition to a set of standardized plans. In the postreform environment, policy makers must find ways to present complex value-based insurance plans in a way that consumers and employers can more readily understand."

(3) Rural MA enrollment varies across the country with concentrations of enrollment on the West Coast, the Great Lakes, and the Northeast regions of the United States. (4) The average monthly weighted premium for rural MA plans with prescription drugs fell in 2012 to $48 from $52 in 2011, but it remains significantly higher than the urban average which also fell during the same time from $38 to $34. (5) Zero premium plans are available to 73% of rural MA beneficiaries and to 95% of urban beneficiaries; however, only 48% of rural beneficiaries that have this option choose these plans compared to 63% of urban beneficiaries. The resulting average non-zero premium was $72 in rural areas in 2012, while the average non-zero premium in urban areas was $81.

Although much of the focus has been on the individual mandate provision's constitutionality, this Comment explores a less-mentioned but equally important implication of PPACA: a change to the rationales behind the common law collateral source rule. The collateral source rule allows an insured plaintiff to recover medical damages in the amount that the medical provider bills, regardless of the fact that the plaintiff's medical provider likely accepted a lesser amount from the plaintiff's insurance company as payment in full. This Comment argues that because PPACA provisions weaken, if not eliminate, at least two of the rationales behind the collateral source rule, courts should calculate medical damages by factoring in the amount the insurance company paid to the provider and a percentage of the health insurance premiums that the plaintiff paid, calculated based on the extent of the plaintiff's injury."

We conducted a literature review and key-informant interviews, reviewed selected online reporting tools, and found that quality and cost reporting fell into two categories. One emphasizes public reporting of information, supported by philanthropic or government institutions that aim to improve provider quality and efficiency. The other is characterized by proprietary websites that aim to provide personalized, integrated information on cost and quality to support consumers' decision making on providers and services. What consumers seem to want is quality data at the physician level and cost data that reflect their personal out-of-pocket exposure. These needs will be acute under the coverage expansions inherent in the Affordable Care Act. State and federal policy thus should support all-payer claims databases, standards for electronic health records to facilitate sharing of quality data, and a unified approach to presenting information that prioritizes consumers' needs."

This article first presents the historical background of the Obama Administration altering the government's 'final rule' for providing health services and protecting conscience rights. The mandate compels individuals and religious groups to provide insurance coverage for contraceptive, abortifacient, and sterilization services even though they are contrary to their values, and it narrowly defines what constitutes a religious group so fewer of them can claim exemption. Hence, the question is: Can individuals and religious groups obey the law without acting against their moral values or denying their religious identity? Using Church documents, the article answers that one cannot formally cooperate in evil but under certain conditions one can materially cooperate. The article uses the Summa Theologiae of Aquinas to explain what constitutes formal cooperation and how obeying the law can be material but not formal cooperation. It then examines whether the present conditions warrant material cooperation. It concludes that they do not and that religious groups are called to act as martyrs and give witness to their religious identity and moral values by resisting the law. © Catholic Medical Association 2013."

FEHBP is the largest employer-sponsored health plan in the United States, covering more than 8 million federal employees, retirees, and their families.Retired federal employees, including retired Members, who meet the minimum enrollment period requirements and who are eligible for an immediate annuity may continue to participate in FEHBP in retirement. Current federal employees, including Members of Congress, may also participate in the Federal Flexible Spending Account Program (FSAFEDS) to set up tax-exempt flexible spending accounts for reimbursement of health care, child care, and elder care expenses not otherwise reimbursed or covered by insurance. Current and retired federal employees, including Members of Congress, may enroll in the Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program (FEDVIP) for supplemental dental and vision insurance coverage. They may also apply for long-term care coverage under the Federal Long Term Care Insurance Program (FLTCIP).All federal employees, including Members of Congress, pay the same payroll taxes as other workers for Medicare Part A coverage, and they are eligible to enroll in Medicare Part B, Part C, and Part D. Current Members, unlike other federal employees, are also eligible to receive health care services from the Office of the Attending Physician in the U.S. Capitol and at military hospitals.The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA; P.L. 111-148) requires health benefit exchanges to be established in every state by January 1, 2014. A provision in ACA requires that the only health plans available to Members of Congress and certain congressional staff as a benefit of their federal employment are health plans created under the ACA or offered through health insurance exchanges, as created by the ACA. The language implies that Members of Congress and certain congressional staff will no longer be eligible to enroll in FEHBP. The director of OPM concluded that this provision is not effective until the health insurance exchanges become operational. Therefore, the provision does not currently affect Members of Congress or their staffs' participation in FEHBP.This report covers health benefits made available to Members of Congress through federal government employment, including FEHBP, dental and vision insurance, flexible spending accounts, long-term care insurance, services at the Office of the Attending Physician and military hospitals, and Medicare.

FEHBP provides many health insurance plan options for enrollees, including nationally available fee-for-service plans, locally available Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs), and, since 2003, various high-deductible health insurance plan options combined with a tax-advantaged account. Beneficiaries can use their tax-advantaged accounts to cover qualified medical expenses. Also, since 2003, FEHBP-eligible active employees can place their own pre-tax wages into a Health Care Flexible Spending Account (HCFSA) to cover qualified medical expenses. Since 2007, eligible individuals may also elect supplemental dental and vision plans.FEHBP is generally available to employees, annuitants, and their dependents. Eligible individuals may elect coverage in an approved health benefits plan for either individual or family coverage. For the 2012 plan year, there are about 206 different plan choices, including all regionally available options. As a practical matter, an individual's choice of plans is often limited to 6 to 15 different plans, depending on where the individual resides. While enrollees have a range of choices, they typically decide which options best match their needs, the amount of their wages they will contribute to health insurance, and how risk-averse they are to potential out-of-pocket costs.While most federal employees or annuitants reaching age 65 are automatically entitled to Medicare Part A, Medicare-eligible employees may also voluntarily choose to enroll in Medicare Part B and Part D. For individuals covered under a FEHBP plan as an annuitant, Medicare is the primary payer and FEHBP is the secondary payer. As a secondary payer, FEHBP could cover a share of Medicare deductibles and coinsurance for any services that are covered by both plans, and FEHBP would continue to reimburse for its covered services that are not covered by Medicare.FEHBP is administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), which is statutorily given the authority to contract with qualified carriers offering plans and to prescribe regulations necessary to carry out the statute, among other duties. Some of OPM's additional duties include coordinating the administration of FEHBP with employing offices, managing contingency reserve funds for the plans, and applying sanctions to health care providers according to the prescribed regulations.The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (P.L. 111-148, ACA, as amended) includes a number of provisions that require certain changes to be made to FEHBP plans or by employing agencies. For example, the ACA requires that, beginning January 2011, adult children up to age 26 can remain/enroll on their parent's plan. All plans in FEHBP have since adhered to this provision. © 2013 Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved."

Since its creation, it has provided private health insurance coverage to federal employees, annuitants, and their dependents. It is the largest employer-sponsored health insurance program in the country; in 2010, nearly 8 million individuals were covered under FEHBP.The program was created by the Federal Employees Health Benefits Act of 1959 (FEHBA, P.L. 86-382). FEHBA and its subsequent amendments established the parameters for eligibility and the election of coverage; the types of health plans and benefits that may be offered; the level of the government's share of premiums; the Employees Health Benefits Fund to pay for program expenses; and provisions for studies, reports, and audits. FEHBA also outlined the role of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). By law, OPM is given the authority to contract with insurers and to prescribe regulations to manage FEHBP, among other duties.The general model of FEHBP has not changed since its inception in 1959. FEHBP was and is a program that allows competing private insurers to offer numerous types of coverage to enrollees within broad federal guidelines. The federal government and the employee/annuitant have always shared the cost of the premium, and generally, employees and annuitants have always had access to the same plans at the same cost. However, specific features of FEHBP have been modified, in some cases multiple times, by Congress and OPM. For example, eligibility has been expanded to include additional types of federal employees and dependents, the formula for determining the government's share of premiums has changed, and the types of health benefits offered through FEHBP plans have been broadened.Congressional policymakers share responsibility with OPM for the program's viability and sustainability. Congress has financial and administrative interest in the program, as the government pays for a share of FEHBP premiums and Congress has legislative authority to modify FEHBP. Congressional interest in FEHBP also extends to FEHBP's potential applicability as a model for other health care programs or as an avenue to provide coverage, such as extending aspects of FEHBP to Medicare, or using it as one of the models for the state exchanges under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA, P.L. 111-148, as amended).The purpose of the report is to provide historical and background information that helps explain how FEHBP has evolved into the program it is today. Policymakers may use this report to understand how Congress has interacted with FEHBP in the past, and to inform its future interactions with FEHBP. Specifically, the report includes short discussions of how Congress has effected and maintained policy changes to FEHBP by restricting the use of federal funds; changed the formula for determining the government's share of FEHBP premiums; expanded eligibility for the program; and implemented policies that affect the relationship between Medicare and FEHBP. The Appendix includes detailed summaries of selected laws or provisions of laws that have directly amended or otherwise changed FEHBP. © 2013 Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved."

An important ingredient in achieving that goal is ensuring that patients have access to their primary care practice outside of regular business hours. This analysis of the 2010 Health Tracking Household Survey found that among people with a usual source of primary care, 40.2 percent reported that their practice offered extended hours, such as at night or on weekends. The analysis also found that one in five people who attempted after-hours contact with their primary care provider reported it was ""very difficult"" or ""somewhat difficult"" to reach a clinician. Those who reported less difficulty contacting a clinician after hours had significantly fewer emergency department visits (30.4 percent compared to 37.7 percent) and lower rates of unmet medical need (6.1 percent compared to 13.7 percent) than people who experienced more difficulty.

Additionally, racial and ethnic minorities with addiction disorders, who constitute approximately 40 percent of the admissions in publicly funded substance abuse treatment programs, may be particularly at risk for poor outcomes. Using national data, we found that blacks and Hispanics were 3.5-8.1 percentage points less likely than whites to complete treatment for alcohol and drugs, and Native Americans were 4.7 percentage points less likely to complete alcohol treatment. Only Asian Americans fared better than whites for both types of treatment. Completion disparities for blacks and Hispanics were largely explained by differences in socioeconomic status and, in particular, greater unemployment and housing instability. However, the alcohol treatment disparity for Native Americans was not explained by socioeconomic or treatment variables, a finding that warrants further investigation. The Affordable Care Act could reduce financial barriers to treatment for minorities, but further steps, such as increased Medicaid funding for residential treatment and better cultural training for providers, would improve the likelihood of completing treatment and increase treatment providers' cultural competence. © 2013 Project HOPE- The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc."

Using a unique data set of 5,900 patients who made a total of 10,509 visits in 2010-12 to the Family Van, an urban mobile health clinic in Massachusetts, we examined the effect of screenings and counseling provided by the clinic on blood pressure. Patients who presented with high blood pressure during their initial visit experienced average reductions of 10.7 mmHg and 6.2 mmHg in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively, during their follow-up visits. These changes were associated with 32.2 percent and 44.6 percent reductions in the relative risk of myocardial infarction and stroke, respectively, which we converted into savings using estimates of the incidence and costs of these conditions over thirty months. The savings from this reduction in blood pressure and patient-reported avoided emergency department visits produced a positive lower bound for the clinic's return on investment of 1.3. All other services of the clinic-those aimed at diabetes, obesity, and maternal health, for example-were excluded from this lower-bound estimate.

Reengineering the US health care system into a primary care-driven model will require widespread, rapid changes in the management and organization of primary care physicians (PCPs). Financial incentives to influence physician behavior have been attempted with various approaches, without empirical evidence of their effectiveness in improving care quality. This study examines the above research question adjusting for the patient-centeredness of the practice climate, a major contextual factor affecting PCPs' ability to provide high-quality care. Methods: Secondary data on a sample of salaried PCPs (n = 1733) from the nation-wide Community Tracking Study Physician Survey 2004-2005 were subject to generalized multinomial logit modeling to examine associations between financial incentives and PCPs' selfreported ability to provide quality care. Results: After adjusting for patient-centered medical home (PCMH)-consistent practice environment, financial incentive aligned with care quality/care content is positively associated with PCPs' ability to provide high-quality care. An encouraging finding was that financial incentives aligned with clinic productivity/profitability do not to impede high-quality care in a PCMH practice environment. Conclusion: Financial incentives targeted to care quality or content indicators may facilitate rapid transformation of the health system to a primary care-driven system. The study provides empirical evidence of the utility of practically deployable financial incentives to facilitate high-quality primary care. © The Author(s) 2012."

The program has expanded training and retention of primary care health professionals for the region through medical school education, graduate medical education, a physician assistant training program, and support for practicing health professionals.The ACA and resulting accountable care organizations (ACOs) present potential challenges for rural settings and health training programs like WWAMI that focus on building the health workforce for rural and underserved populations. As more Americans acquire health coverage, more health professionals will be needed, especially in primary care. Rural locations may face increased competition for these professionals. Medical schools are expanding their positions to meet the need, but limits on graduate medical education expansion may result in a bottleneck, with insufficient residency positions for graduating students. The development of ACOs may further challenge building a rural workforce by limiting training opportunities for health professionals because of competing demands and concerns about cost, efficiency, and safety associated with training. Medical education programs like WWAMI will need to increase efforts to train primary care physicians and increase their advocacy for student programs and additional graduate medical education for rural constituents."

ACA requires -American Health Benefit Exchanges"" to be established in every state by January 1, 2014, either by the state itself or by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS). Exchanges will not be insurers, but will provide eligible individuals and small businesses with access to private health insurance plans. Generally, the plans offered through the exchanges will provide comprehensive coverage and meet all ACA market reforms, as applicable. One of the requirements that most exchange plans must meet is to provide a certain level of coverage generosity based on actuarial value. Each level of coverage generosity is designated according to a precious metal and corresponds to a specific actuarial value: Bronze (actuarial value of 60%), Silver (70%), Gold (80%), and Platinum (90%). To make exchange coverage more affordable, certain individuals will receive premium assistance in the form of federal tax credits. The premium credit will be an advanceable, refundable tax credit, meaning taxpayers need not wait until the end of the tax year in order to benefit from the credit, and may claim the full credit amount even if they have little or no federal income tax liability. Although the premium credits will not be available until 2014, the illustrations provided in this report are based on current federal poverty levels, to reflect how the estimated premium credit amounts compare to current income levels. Under ACA, the amount received in premium credits is based on income tax returns. These amounts are reconciled in the next year and can result in overpayment of premium credits if income increases, which must be repaid to the federal government. ACA limited the amount of required repayments. Since the enactment of ACA, these limits have been increased in order to raise revenues for other legislative initiatives (e.g., P.L. 111-309 and P.L. 112-9). Most recently, on June 7, 2012, the House passed H.R. 436, the Health Care Cost Reduction Act of 2012, which includes a measure that would remove all limits on repayment, making individuals fully liable for the full amount of any premium credit overpayment. Relative affordability of health insurance premiums individuals and families might face within health insurance exchanges will likely vary from exchange to exchange based on a host of factors, including enrollees' age, the varying prices paid by plans for medical goods and services, the breadth of the provider network, the provisions regarding how out-of-network care is paid for (or not), and the use of tools by the plan to reduce health care utilization (e.g., prior authorization for certain tests). Examples provided in the Appendix of this report depict a range by which premiums might reasonably be expected to vary based on enrollees' age, and variation in medical costs across geographic areas, for purposes of illustration only. Actual premiums will likely vary among health insurance exchanges based on a wide range of factors other than those depicted in this report. New federal tax credits were authorized in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA, P.L. 111-148, as amended), to help certain individuals pay for health insurance coverage, beginning in 2014. The tax credits will go towards the cost of purchasing coverage offered through health insurance exchanges-marketplaces offering comprehensive, private health plans. This report describes who will be eligible for the premium credits,1 and how the credit amounts will be calculated. It also highlights key issues raised by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in the notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) on the premium credits.2 The Appendix provides analysis of the concept of -affordability"" as applicable to the premium credits. © 2013 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The ACA made broad-based changes to the law with respect to health insurance coverage in the individual and group markets and the law with respect to group health plans as well as laws that apply to Medicare and Medicaid. The ACA also includes a significant number of changes to the Code,3 including the addition of new Code sections and the amendment of previously existing Code sections. Further, the ACA also included off-Code revenue provisions that impose certain industry fees. The majority of the ACA revenue provisions are in effect as of 2013. However several of the ACA revenue provisions, including the refundable premium assistance credit, the tax on individuals who fail to maintain minimum essential coverage, and the shared responsibility for employer regarding health coverage, become effective in 2014. These provisions are designed to become effective at the same time as when the most comprehensive of the changes to the individual and small group health insurance markets go into effect, including the establishment of American Health Benefit Exchanges (State-based exchanges for the sale of individual and small group health insurance plans), mandatory community rating in health insurance premiums, guaranteed issue for purchasers of individual health insurance plans, and a prohibition against preexisting condition limitations in health insurance plans. One of the ACA revenue provisions, which provides an excise tax on high cost employer-sponsored health coverage, does not become effective until 2018. This document,4 prepared by the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation, provides a summary of health insurance changes made by the ACA and a description of the present-law rules with respect to the ACA revenue provisions5 and includes a discussion of implementation6 of these revenue provisions. The descriptions of the ACA revenue provisions are divided into three sections. Section I describes provisions in effect as of 2013; Section II describes provisions becoming effective in 2014; and Section III describes the one provision becoming effective in 2018. In the case of new Code provisions and the ACA revenue provisions creating new industry fees, this document describes the new provisions (reflecting post-enactment amendments, if any). In the case of pre-existing Code provisions amended by the ACA, this document describes the present law with respect to the relevant Code provision, as amended by the ACA. Other background with respect to a provision is included in the description to the extent needed to understand the present law with respect to that provision. © 2013 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Assessments of the adequacy of physician supply often focus on three dimensions of the physician population: its size; its composition (e.g., the mix between primary care and specialty physicians); and its geographic distribution. Policies that aim to alter physician supply generally focus on both current and future supply along these three dimensions because physician training is a lengthy process; therefore, changes implemented to alter supply do not have immediate effects. Each of the three dimensions of physician supply is important for health care spending and for population health because physician clinical decisions affect approximately 90% of each health care dollar spent. In addition, as physicians provide health care services that, with some exceptions, cannot be provided by non-physicians, the size, composition, and geographic distribution of the physician population affects the amount and type of health care services available. A number of studies have found physician shortages overall, in certain specialties, and in certain geographic areas. The federal government pays for physician services, primarily through the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and supports physician training through a number of programs in various departments and agencies. Given current investments in physician services and the physician workforce, the adequacy of the current and future physician supply may be of interest to Congress. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA, P.L. 111- 148) may affect physician supply because it expands insurance coverage to those previously uninsured. PPACA also includes provisions that may affect the size, composition, and geographic distribution of the physician population by supporting changes to physician training, compensation, and practice. Specifically, provisions targeting the number of physicians trained and their productivity may affect the size of the physician population. The composition of the physician population may be altered by provisions targeting the supply of primary care providers or specialties in shortage. Provisions addressing the diversity of the physician workforce and those incentivizing practice in rural or other underserved areas may affect the geographic distribution of the physician population. Finally, PPACA includes provisions that provide for data collection and evaluation of the adequacy of the workforce in general, and federal workforce programs specifically. Whether and how these provisions will affect physician supply is not yet known because some of these provisions have not been implemented yet, are temporary, will not have immediate effects, or rely on discretionary funding. This report examines each dimension of physician supply, separately discussing current (and, where appropriate, future) concerns and relevant changes included in PPACA that may affect each dimension. The report then discusses workforce planning activities included in PPACA that may affect all three dimensions of supply. © 2013 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved."

The authority and responsibilities of an exchange may vary, depending on statutory or other requirements for its establishment and structure. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA, P.L. 111-148, as amended) requires health insurance exchanges to be established in every state by January 1, 2014. ACA provides certain requirements for the establishment of exchanges, while leaving other choices to be made by the states. Qualified individuals and small businesses will be able to purchase private health insurance through exchanges. Issuers selling health insurance plans through an exchange will have to follow certain rules, such as meeting the private market reform requirements in ACA. While the fundamental purpose of the exchanges will be to facilitate the offer and purchase of health insurance, nothing in the law prohibits qualified individuals, qualified employers, and insurance carriers from participating in the health insurance market outside of exchanges. Moreover, ACA explicitly states that enrollment in exchanges is voluntary and no individual may be compelled to enroll in exchange coverage. Exchanges may be established either by the state itself as a ""state exchange"" or by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) as a ""federally-facilitated exchange."" A federally-facilitated exchange may be operated solely by the federal government, or it may be operated by the federal government in conjunction with the state, as a ""partnership"" exchange. All exchanges are required to carry out many of the same functions and adhere to many of the same standards, although there are important differences between the types of exchanges. States had to declare their intentions toestablish their own exchange no later than December 14, 2012; to date, 17 states and D.C. have received conditional approval from HHS to operate a state exchange. States interested in pursuing a partnership exchange must declare their intentions no later than February 15, 2013. ACA and regulations require exchanges to carry out a number of different functions. The primary functions relate to determining eligibility and enrolling individuals in appropriate plans, plan management, consumer assistance and accountability, and financial management. ACA gives various federal agencies, primarily HHS, responsibilities relating to the general operation of exchanges. Federal agencies are generally responsible for promulgating regulations, creating criteria and systems, and awarding grants to states to help them create and implement exchanges. A state that is approved to operate its own exchange has a number of operational decisions to make, including decisions related to organizational structure (governmental agency or a nonprofit entity); types of exchanges (separate individual and Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP) exchanges, or a merged exchange); collaboration (a state may independently operate an exchange or enter into contracts with other states); service area (a state may establish one or more subsidiary exchanges in the state if each exchange serves a geographically distinct area and meets certain size requirements); contracted services (an exchange may contract with certain entities to carry out one or more responsibilities of the exchange); and governance (governing board and standards of conduct). In general, health plans offered through exchanges will provide comprehensive coverage and meet all applicable private market reforms specified in ACA. Most exchange plans will provide coverage for ""essential health benefits,"" at minimum; be subject to certain limits on cost-sharing, including out-of-pocket costs; and meet one of four levels of plan generosity based on actuarial value. To make exchange coverage more affordable, certain individuals will receive premium assistance in the form of federal tax credits. Moreover, some recipients of premium credits may also receive subsidies toward cost-sharing expenses. This report outlines the required minimum functions of exchanges, and explains how exchanges are expected to be established and administered under ACA. The coverage offered through exchanges is discussed, and the report concludes with a discussion of how exchanges will interact with selected other ACA provisions. © 2013 Nova Science Publishers, Inc."

Although the German healthcare system has a number of shortfalls, its paradigm could offer the most appropriate compromise when selecting the economic incentives to reduce the percentage of the U.S. gross domestic product expenditure for healthcare from 17.4% to roughly 12.0%.

Purpose: The current review provides evidence on the economic impact of services that will be covered under the ACA, focusing on IOM-recommended measures that address women's health. Methods: This review analyzed the cost-effectiveness literature related to these services using the Tufts Medical Center Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Registry (www.cearegistry.org), which catalogs detailed information on cost-effectiveness studies published in English in the peer-reviewed literature. In order to keep the review relevant to current clinical practice, the analysis was restricted to studies published in 2000-2010. The data search and analysis were performed in 2011. Results: Cost-effectiveness studies have evaluated a limited subset of the preventive measures available for women. Further, few cost-effectiveness studies have evaluated the recommended counseling and screening services for women. Of 16 relevant studies found, eight focused on HIV screening, with results varying substantially depending on the specific groups screened and the screening frequency. Conclusions: The current review underscores the finding that there is a substantial gap in the health economic literature on preventive care, especially with respect to screening and counseling of women in the primary care setting. There is some evidence that better access to preventive services can be maintained at a reasonable cost to the healthcare system, and that certain services may even lower healthcare costs. © 2013 American Journal of Preventive Medicine."

The Affordable Care Act legislates a number of new strategies - such as innovative payment and delivery models and increased public health funding - intended to improve diabetes prevention and care quality. Health information technology (IT) is often cited as a critical part of these strategies. Through the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act of 2009, the federal government has been supporting the rapid adoption of health IT, and more specifically of electronic health records (EHRs) through the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) EHR Incentive Program. Health IT has the potential to contribute to diabetes prevention and improved quality of care, but the evidence supporting its benefits is mixed. This article provides a brief overview of the CMS EHR Incentive Program and meaningful-use criteria. Then it examines health IT strategies for diabetes prevention in the context of current evidence and identifies areas of needed research and innovation."

Data Sources/Collection We used national Medicare enrollment, claims, and the Minimum Data Set to examine 2.8 million newly discharged patients to 15,063 SNFs from 2,477 general hospitals between 2004 and 2006. Study Design We examined the relationship between the proportion of discharges from a hospital and alternative SNFs on the rehospitalization of patients treated by that hospital-SNF pair using an instrumental variable approach. We used distances to alternative SNFs from residence of the patients of the originating hospital as the instrument. Principal Findings Our estimates suggest that if the proportion of a hospital's discharges to an SNF was to increase by 10 percentage points, the likelihood of patients treated by that hospital-SNF pair to be rehospitalized within 30 days would decline by 1.2 percentage points, largely driven by fewer rehospitalizations within a week of hospital discharge. Conclusions Stronger hospital-SNF linkages, independent of hospital ownership, were found to reduce rehospitalization rates. As hospitals are held accountable for patients' outcomes postdischarge under the Affordable Care Act, hospitals may steer their patients preferentially to fewer SNFs. © Health Research and Educational Trust."

SCHLESINGER, JR., who served as ""court historian"" and Special Assistant to President John F. Kennedy, was asked not long after the chief executive was assassinated on November 22, 1963 to assess the Administration's impact. He responded by indicating that a quasi-categorical demurral best characterized the situation, by which he meant it still was much too early to be able to provide a full assessment of the achievements of the Kennedy presidency. Currently, self-appointed pundits on both sides of the political divide do not lack opinions on the value or lack thereof of the Patient Protection and Affordability Act (ACA), which became the law of the land on March 23, 2010. Yet, to invoke Schlesinger's point of view, it remains somewhat premature to issue a fully informed judgment on the value of this legislation because many of its main provisions have not been fully implemented as of mid-summer 2013. A useful term that underlies this essay is entelechy, which in one sense of the word means that there always are new forms of knowledge destined to emerge, but which despite that inevitability, observers of the health scene may be taken utterly by surprise. A good example is that an announcement on July 2, 2013 from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) indicated that the implementation date of a mandate aimed at companies with 50 or more full-time workers (i.e., employed 30 or more hours per week) to provide health insurance coverage would be postponed from January 1, 2014 to the beginning of the following year. One consequence is that there will be $12 billion in lost tax revenue and additional costs, according to the Congressional Budget Office [1]. The result of this decision was akin to tossing a banana to starving denizens of a zoo monkey cage. Opponents of the law, primarily Republicans, scrambled to seize on the announcement to proclaim that it provided just one more justification for scuttling an unworkable law. Accompanying this assertion was a demand that the imposition of the individual mandate, another key component of the ACA, also be deferred until 2015. Despite President Obama's veto threats, House lawmakers on July 17 approved two separate bills amending portions of the Affordable Care Act, the latest moves by Republicans to repeal the health law. A measure was approved 264 to 161, with 35 Democrats in favor, to codify President Obama's decision to suspend the employer mandate. A second bill was passed 251 to 174, with 22 Democrats joining the majority, to delay the individual mandate to purchase insurance for the same 1-year period. Both efforts are consistent with approximately 40 different attempts since the law was enacted to repeal it either in whole or in part. Meanwhile, Senator Mark Begich (D-AK) introduced S. 1330 on July 18 to delay the implementation of the employer mandate until 2016. Congress already has been instrumental in (1) achieving a repeal of the Form 1099 mandate that would require companies to track and report to the Internal Revenue Service all business-to-business transactions over $600, and (2) terminating the Community Living Assistance Services and Supports Act (CLASS), a long-term care insurance provision. Also, in March 2013, 79 Senators voted to repeal the 2.3% tax on medical-device company revenues that is in effect as of January of this year. © 2013, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc."

Hospitals, however, have roared back to life, in part by reworking their business model. There has been a wave of consolidations and acquisitions (including acquisitions of community-based clinics), with deals valued at $7.9 billion in 2011, the most in a decade, and the number of deals increasing another 18% in 2012. The costs of hospital care are enormous, with 31.5% ($851 billion) of the total health expenditures in the United States in 2011 devoted to these services. Hospitals are (1) placing growing emphasis on increasing revenue and decreasing costs; (2) engaging in pervasive marketing campaigns encouraging patients to view hospitals as an all-purpose care provider; (3) geographically targeting the expansion of their services to ""capture"" well-insured patients, while placing greater pressure on patients to pay for the services delivered; (4) increasing their size, wealth, and clout, with two-thirds of hospitals undertaking renovations or additional construction and smaller hospitals being squeezed out, and (5) expanding their use of hospital-employed physicians, rather than relying on community-based physicians with hospital privileges, and exercising greater control over medical staff. Hospitals have become so pivotal in the U.S. healthcare system that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (PPACA) frequently targeted them as a vehicle to enhance patient safety and control escalating health care costs. One such provision--the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program, which goes into effect in fiscal year 2013--will reduce payments ordinarily made to hospitals if they have an ""excess readmission"" rate. It is estimated that adverse events following a hospital discharge impact as many as 19% of all discharged patients. When hospitals and similar health care facilities fail to adequately manage the discharge of their patients, devastating medical emergencies and sizeable healthcare costs can result. The urgency to better manage these discharges is compounded by the fact that the average length of hospital stays continues to shorten, potentially increasing the number of discharged patients who are at considerable risk of relapse. Also exacerbating the problem is a lack of clarity regarding who, if anyone, is responsible for these patients following discharge. Confusion over who bears responsibility for discharge-related preparation and community outreach, concerns about compensation, a lack of clear institutional policies, and the absence of legal mandates that patients be properly prepared for and monitored after discharge all contribute to the potential abandonment of patients at a crucial juncture. Although the PPACA establishes financial incentives for hospitals and similar facilities to combat the long-standing problem of high readmission rates, it does not provide a remedy for patients who have suffered avoidable harm after being discharged without adequate preparation or post-discharge assistance. This omission is particularly problematic as existing legal remedies, including medical malpractice suits, have provided little recourse for patients who have suffered injury that could have been prevented through the implementation of reasonable discharge-related policies. To protect the many patients who are highly vulnerable to complications following discharge and to provide them redress when needed services are not provided, hospitals' obligations to these patients should be recognized for what they are: a fiduciary duty to provide adequate discharge preparation and post-discharge services. The recognition of this duty is driven by changes in the nature of hospital care that enhance the perception that hospitals have become a ""big business"" that should ""carry their own freight."" Properly interpreted, this duty requires facilities to implement an appropriate discharge plan and provide post-discharge services for a period of time commensurate with a patient's continuing health risks. Notably, this is not the same as a generalized duty to provide all patients with continuing post-discharge treatment. It is a more limited obligation to offer necessary clarification and direction to patients upon discharge, and to institute a reasonable post-discharge monitoring program for patients with continuing health risks."

Florida Medicaid introduced the Enhanced Benefits Rewards (EBR) program in 2006, providing financial incentives as rewards to beneficiaries who engage in health care seeking and healthy behaviors. Methods: This study analyzed beneficiary survey data from 2009 to determine predictors associated with awareness of and participation in the EBR program. Results: Non- English speakers, those in a racial and ethnic minority group, those with less than a high school education, and those with limited or no connection to a health care provider were associated with lower awareness of the program. Among those aware of the program, these factors were also associated with reduced likelihood of engaging in the program. Individuals in fair or poor health were also less likely to engage in an approved behavior. Individuals who speak Spanish at home and those without a high school diploma were more likely than other groups to spend their earned program credits. Conclusions: Findings underscore the fact that initial engagement in such a program can prove challenging as different groups are not equally likely to be aware of or participate in an approved activity or redeem a credit. Physicians may play important roles in encouraging participation in programs to incentivize healthy behaviors. © The Author(s) 2012."

Marketplace administrators may choose to limit the number and type of plans offered to further simplify consumer decision-making. This issue brief examines the policies set by some state-based marketplaces to simplify plan choices: adopting a meaningful difference standard, limiting the number of plans or benefit designs insurers may offer, or requiring standardized benefit designs. Eleven states and the District of Columbia took one or more of these actions for 2014, though their policies vary in terms of their prescriptiveness.

Contemporary research suggests that postacute, home-based care of patients with chronic heart failure may yield outcomes similar to those of clinic-based outpatient care. However, the transition to home-based care is associated with a number of risks. Indeed, these patients often experience a downward cycle of repeat hospitalization and worsening functional capacity. In 2010, a group at Cleveland Clinic launched the ""Heart Care at Home"" program in order to minimize the risks that patients experience both when being transitioned to home and when being cared for at home. This program joins a handful of transitional care programs that have been discussed in the medical literature."

However, there is no recommended standard time for delivery of AC. We explored the timeliness of AC with FOLFOX as a predictor of recurrence and its role as a quality indicator in patients with stage III colon cancer. Patients and Methods We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients with colon cancer who received AC at Los Angeles County Hospital and Norris Cancer Center between 2003 and 2011. Time to recurrence (TTR) was the primary end point of the study, Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank tests were used to assess the association between timing of the AC and TTR. Results We identified 102 patients with stage III colon cancer who had received AC. With a median follow-up of 3.2 years, time from surgery to AC was not a predictor of recurrence (P =.19). However, there was a nonsignificant trend toward higher risk of systemic recurrence when the delay of AC was more than 12 weeks (P =.068). Additionally, a significant association was found between age, race, type of hospital, and timeliness of AC. Conclusion To date, our study is the largest data set to assess the timeliness of FOLFOX as a predictor of outcome in stage III colon cancer. Because FOLFOX is the current standard for AC for colon cancer, we report a trend toward worse outcome when FOLFOX is delayed more than 12 weeks. This result, thus supports quality measures to assess the timeliness of AC in stage III colon cancer and might have a meaningful effect on the care of patients with colon cancer. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Those who do not maintain minimum essential coverage, and who are not exempt from the mandate, will be required to pay a penalty for noncompliance.

Methods: National Health Interview Survey data (1997-2010) were analyzed. Results: Unmet need increased from 4.3 million in 1997 to 7.2million in 2010. Rates in 2010 were about five times higher for uninsured than for privately insured persons.

To better understand how delivery systems can implement shared decision making, we interviewed representatives of eight primary care sites participating in a demonstration funded and coordinated by the Informed Medical Decisions Foundation. Barriers to shared decision making included overworked physicians, insufficient provider training, and clinical information systems incapable of prompting or tracking patients through the decision-making process.

It also illustrates how contentious public policy is debated, formulated, and implemented in today’s overheated political environment. Health care reform is perhaps the most divisive public policy issue facing the United States today. Michael Doonan provides a unique perspective on health policy in explaining how intergovernmental relations shape public policy. He tracks federal-state relations through the creation, formulation, and implementation of three of the most important health policy initiatives since the Great Society: the State Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), both passed by the U.S. Congress, and the Massachusetts health care reform program as it was developed and implemented under federal government waiver authority. He applies lessons learned from these cases to implementation of the Affordable Care Act. “Health policymaking is entangled in a complex web of shared, overlapping, and/or competing power relationships among different levels of government,“ the author notes. Understanding federal-state interactions, the ways in which they vary, and the reasons for such variation is essential to grasping the ultimate impact of federalism on programs and policy. Doonan reveals how federalism can shift as the sausage of public policy is made while providing a new framework for comprehending one of the most polarizing debates of our time. © 2013 The Brookings Institution.

Some have suggested that the Great Recession alone was the cause, but health expenditure growth in the depths of the recession was nearly identical to growth prior to the recession. Nor can the Affordable Care Act (ACA) take credit, since the slowdown began prior to its implementation. Instead, we identify three primary causes of the slowdown: the rise in high-deductible insurance plans, state-level efforts to control Medicaid costs, and a general slowdown in the diffusion of new technology, particularly for use by the Medicare population. A more difficult question is: Will this slowdown continue? On this question we are pessimistic, and not entirely because a similar (and temporary) slowdown occurred in the early 1990s. The primary determinant of long-term growth is the continued development of expensive technology, and there is little evidence of a permanent slowdown in that pipeline. Proton beam accelerators are on target to double between 2010 and 2014, while the market for heart-assist devices (costing more than $300,000 each) is projected to grow rapidly. Accountable care organizations (ACOs) and emboldened insurance companies may yet stifle health care cost growth, but our best estimate over the next two decades is that health care costs will grow at GDP plus 1.2 percent, a rate lower than previous estimates but still on track to cause serious fiscal pain for taxpayers and workers who bear the costs of higher premiums."

Certain demographic groups in the United States - including racial and ethnic minorities and individuals with lower socioeconomic status - have poorer health outcomes across a wide array of diseases, and have higher all-cause mortality. Yet despite growing understanding of how social-, structural-, and individual-level factors maintain and create inequities, solutions to reduce or eliminate them have been elusive. In this article, the authors envision how disparities-related provisions in the Affordable Care Act and other recent legislation could be linked with new value-based health care requirements and payment models to create incentives for narrowing health care disparities and move the nation toward equity.Specifically, the authors explore how recent legislative actions regarding payment reform, health information technology, community health needs assessments, and expanding health equity research could be woven together to build an evidence base for solutions to health care inequities. Although policy interventions at the clinical and payer levels alone will not eliminate disparities, given the significant role the social determinants of health play in the etiology and maintenance of inequity, such policies can allow the health care system to better identify and leverage community assets; provide high-quality, more equitable care; and demonstrate that equity is a value in health."

Community health centers (CHCs) are an underused resource that could facilitate rapid expansion of the primary care workforce and simultaneously prepare trainees for 21st-century practice. The Teaching Health Center Graduate Medical Education (THCGME) program, currently funded by the Affordable Care Act, uses CHCs as training sites for primary-care-focused graduate medical education (GME).The authors propose that the goals of the THCGME program could be amplified by fostering partnerships between CHCs and teaching hospitals (academic medical centers [AMCs]). AMCs would encourage their primary care residency programs to expand by establishing teaching health center (THC) tracks. Modifications to the current THCGME model, facilitated by formal CHC and academic medicine partnerships (CHAMPs), would address the primary care physician shortage, produce physicians prepared for 21st-century practice, expose trainees to interprofessional education in a multidisciplinary environment, and facilitate the rapid expansion of CHC capacity.To succeed, CHAMP THCs require a comprehensive consortium agreement designed to ensure equity between the community and academic partners; conforming with this agreement will provide the high-quality GME necessary to ensure residency accreditation. CHAMP THCs also require a federal mechanism to ensure stable, long-term funding.

METHOD: The authors identified residents who trained in safety net settings from 2001 to 2005 and in 2009 using 100% Medicare Part B claims files for FQHCs, RHCs, and CAHs and 2011 American Medical Association Masterfile residency start and end date histories.

RESULTS: The authors identified 662 residents who had a Medicare claim filed in their name by an RHC, 975 by an FQHC, and 1,793 by a CAH from 2001 to 2005 and in 2009. By 2009, that number of residents per year had declined for RHCs and FQHCs but increased substantially for CAHs.

The authors believe that although the pace of health system transformation has accelerated, a shortage of workers trained to function in the new models of care is hampering progress. In this Perspective, they argue that urgent attention must be paid to retraining the 18 million workers already employed in the system who will actually implement system change.Their view is shaped by work they have conducted in helping practices transform care, by extensive consultations with stakeholders attempting to understand the workforce implications of health system redesign, and by a thorough review of the peer-reviewed and gray literature. Through this work, the authors have become increasingly convinced that academic health centers (AHCs)-organizations at the forefront of innovations in health care delivery and health workforce training-are uniquely situated to proactively lead efforts to retrain the existing workforce.

This research has assessed individual categories of overpayment for, at most, a few years. However, no study has calculated the total overpayments to private plans since the program's inception. Prior to 2004, selective enrollment of healthier seniors was the major source of excess payments. We estimate this has added US$41 billion to Medicare's costs since 1985. Medicare adopted a risk-adjustment scheme in 2004, but this has not curbed private plans' ability to game the payment system. This has added US$122.5 billion to Medicare's costs since 2004. Congress mandated increased payment to private plans in the 2003 Medicare Modernization Act, which was mitigated, to a degree, by the subsequent Affordable Care Act. In total, we find that Medicare has overpaid private insurers by US$282.6 billion since 1985.

In 2009 and 2010, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) expanded governmental funding for CER in the USA by creating the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI). The PCORI plans to prioritize research aimed at helping patients, clinicians, and other stakeholders make more informed decisions in real-world situations, a goal that will likely require an emphasis on less traditional research methods that are more representative of typical clinical practice such as pragmatic trials and observational research. The new funds should provide a much-needed boost to CER, however several challenges loom. In addition to promoting research that is both valid and relevant in real-world situations, the PCORI will need to find more effective ways to ensure that CER findings are disseminated and implemented in clinical practice. The latter task may be particularly challenging since the ACA places limits on the use of CER findings for decisions related to payment, coverage, or treatment. In addition, the ACA limits the PCORI from supporting cost-effectiveness research, which stakeholders might use to allocate health care resources most efficiently. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

To provide high-quality care efficiently to the expanded population of insured individuals, the health care workforce and care delivery structures will need to be tailored to meet the needs of specific groups within the population.To help create a foundation for understanding the use patterns of the newly insured and to recommend possible approaches to care delivery and workforce development, the authors describe the 13-year-old experience of the Virginia Coordinated Care program (VCC). The VCC, developed by Virginia Commonwealth University Health System in Richmond, Virginia, is a health-system-sponsored care coordination program that provides primary and specialty care services to patients who are indigent. The authors have categorized VCC patients from fiscal year 2011 by medical complexity. Then, on the basis of the resulting utilization data for each category over the next fiscal year, the authors describe the medical needs and health behaviors of the four different patient groups. Finally, the authors discuss possible approaches for providing primary, preventive, and specialty care to improve the health of the population while controlling costs and how adoption of the approaches might be shaped by care delivery systems and educational institutions."

She became a leading feminist voice and influence on a number of topics. In later years, she returned to concerns about reproductive justice by presciently emphasizing the need to preserve women's access to abortions. This Essay discusses Professor Scales's concerns and feminist method and then turns to reproductive justice. The Essay notes that, with Scales, a right to abortion is foundational for reproductive justice. The Essay then examines the increasing narrowing of access to abortion through law. The Essay next examines a current crisis over access to contraception, including arguments that some contraceptives are abortifacients and therefore should not be available and the debate over insurance coverage for contraception under the Affordable Care Act. The Essay concludes with an examination of what reproductive justice advocates can do to stop what appears to be a steady undermining of rights to abortion and contraception, drawing in part on Professor Scales's concern with always examining women's voices and using political as well as litigation strategies."

The size and complexity of these programs will only increase with the implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Yet, many state Medicaid programs lack the resources and breadth of expertise to maximize the value of their programs not only for their beneficiaries but also for all those served by the health care system.Universities, especially those with medical schools and other health science programs, can serve as valuable partners in helping state Medicaid programs achieve higher levels of performance, including designing and implementing new approaches for monitoring the effectiveness and outcomes of health services and developing and sharing knowledge about program outcomes. In turn, universities can expand their role in public policy decision making while taking advantage of opportunities for additional research, training, and funding. As of 2013, approximately a dozen universities have developed formal agreements to provide faculty and care delivery resources to support their state Medicaid programs. These examples offer a road map for how others might approach developing similar, mutually beneficial partnerships."

ACA increases access to health insurance coverage, expands federal private health insurance market requirements, and requires the creation of health insurance exchanges to provide individuals and small employers with access to insurance. It also expands Medicaid coverage. The costs to the federal government of expanding health insurance and Medicaid coverage are projected to be offset by increased taxes and revenues and reduced spending on Medicare and other federal health programs. Implementation of ACA, which began upon the law's enactment and is scheduled to unfold over the next few years, involves all the major health care stakeholders, including the federal and state governments, as well as employers, insurers, and health care providers. Following the enactment of ACA, individuals, states, and other entities challenged various provisions of ACA on constitutional grounds. Many of these suits addressed ACA's requirement for individuals to have health insurance (i.e., the individual mandate), and claimed that it is beyond the scope of Congress's enumerated powers. The expansion of the Medicaid program was also challenged, as state plaintiffs contended that the expansion impermissibly infringes upon states' rights, coercing them into accepting onerous conditions in exchange for federal funds. On June 28, 2012, the Supreme Court issued its decision in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, finding that the individual mandate is a constitutional exercise of Congress's authority to levy taxes. However, the Court held that it was not a valid exercise of Congress's power under the Commerce Clause or the Necessary and Proper Clause. With regard to the Medicaid expansion provision, the Court further held that the federal government cannot terminate current Medicaid program federal matching funds if a state refuses to expand its Medicaid program. If a state accepts the new ACA Medicaid expansion funds, it must abide by the new expansion coverage rules, but, based on the Court's opinion, it appears that a state can refuse to participate in the expansion without losing any of its current federal Medicaid matching funds. All other provisions of ACA, as amended by HCERA, remain intact. The 111th Congress passed major health reform legislation, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA; P.L. 111-148), which was substantially amended by the health provisions in the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (HCERA; P.L. 111-152). Several other laws that were subsequently enacted made more targeted changes to specific ACA provisions. All references to ACA in this report refer to the law as amended.

However, prior research provides us with scant evidence as to whether federal parity legislation will hold the potential for improving access to SUD treatment. OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of state-level SUD parity laws on state-aggregate SUD treatment rates and to shed light on the impact of the recent federal SUD parity legislation. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We conducted a quasi-experimental study using a 2-way (state and year) fixed-effect method. We included all known specialty SUD treatment facilities in the United States and examined treatment rates from October 1, 2000, through March 31, 2008. Our main sourceof data was the National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services, which provides facility-level information on specialty SUD treatment. INTERVENTIONS: State-level SUD parity laws during the study period. MAINOUTCOMES ANDMEASURES: State-aggregate SUD treatment rates in (1) all specialty SUD treatment facilities and (2) specialty SUD treatment facilities accepting private insurance. RESULTS: The implementation of any SUD parity law increased the treatment rate by 9% (P <.001) in all specialty SUD treatment facilities and by 15% (P =.02) in facilities accepting private insurance. Full parity and parity only if SUD coverage is offered increased the SUD treatment rate by 13% (P =.02) and 8% (P =.04), respectively, in all facilities and by 21% (P =.03) and 10% (P =.04), respectively, in facilities accepting private insurance. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: We found a positive effect of the implementation of state SUD parity legislation on access to specialty SUD treatment. Furthermore, the positive association is more pronounced in states with more comprehensive parity laws. Our findings suggest that federal parity legislation holds the potential to improve access to SUD treatment. © Copyright 2013 American Medical Association. All rights reserved."

It will only get worse as many more Americans gain insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act and as additional millions enter the Medicare system. There is a serious concern that the pipeline for the production of the physician workforce is inadequate to meet future needs. It is imperative to continue to monitor the structure and size of this pipeline - the purpose of the research reported here. METHOD: This descriptive analysis uses data derived from the National Graduate Medical Education Census, which includes reports on the entire population of residents in programs accredited by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education. Data for the years 2001 to 2010 are reported both on specialties which can be entered directly from medical school or with one preliminary year and on subspecialty residencies and fellowships, which require completion of an earlier residency program. Estimates of the number of new trainees who will practice primary care are provided. RESULTS: In 2010, there were 4,754 residents reported in preliminary programs, 89,142 residents in core specialty and combined specialty programs, and 20,007 in subspecialty and sub-subspecialty programs. Between 2001 and 2010, there was a 13.6% (13,655) increase in all residents. Since 2001, there has been a 6.3% (540) decrease in the number expected to enter primary care. CONCLUSIONS: Without a substantially accelerated growth in graduate medical education, the physician workforce will fall short of the nation's needs, and competition for available residency positions will radically increase."

More recently, Section 6411 of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) expanded the RAC program to include the Medicaid program. This shows the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) believe RAC audits are a cost-effective method to ensure health care providers are paid correctly and thereby protect the Medicare Trust Fund. RAC audits are highly complex and require significant manpower to handle the large volume of requests received during a short period of time. Additionally, the RAC audit appeal process is complicated and requires a high level of technical expertise. The demonstration project found that RAC audits resulted in sizeable amounts of overpayments collected (""take-backs"") from many providers. This research study assesses the potential impact of the RAC audit program on US acute care hospitals. Data obtained from CMS show that RAC overpayments collected for FY 2010 were $75.4 million, increased to $797.4 million in FY 2011, and increased to $986.2 million in the first six months of FY 2012. According to the American Hospital Association (AHA) RAC Trac audit survey, the vast majority of these collections represent complex denials where hospitals are required to provide medical record documents in support of their billed claims. This study found that the RAC audit program collections are increasing significantly over time. As a result, these collections are having a significant negative impact on the profitability of US hospitals. © 2013 CCH Incorporated."

OBJECTIVES: To determine the relationship between hospital nursing; that is, nurse work environment, nurse staffing levels, and nurse education, and 30-day readmissions among Medicare patients with heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, and pneumonia. Method and Design: Analysis of linked data from California, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania that included information on the organization of hospital nursing (ie, work environment, patient-to-nurse ratios, and proportion of nurses holding a BSN degree) from a survey of nurses, as well as patient discharge data, and American Hospital Association Annual Survey data. Robust logistic regression was used to estimate the relationship between nursing factors and 30-day readmission. Results: Nearly 1 quarter of heart failure index admissions [23.3% (n=39,954)], 19.1% (n=12,131) of myocardial infarction admissions, and 17.8% (n=25,169) of pneumonia admissions were readmitted within 30 days. Each additional patient per nurse in the average nurse's workload was associated with a 7% higher odds of readmission for heart failure [odds ratio (OR)=1.07; confidence interval CI, 1.05-1.09], 6% for pneumonia patients (OR=1.06; CI, 1.03-1.09), and 9% for myocardial infarction patients (OR=1.09; CI, 1.05-1.13). Care in a hospital with a good versus poor work environment was associated with odds of readmission that were 7% lower for heart failure (OR=0.93; CI, 0.89-0.97), 6% lower for myocardial infarction (OR=0.94; CI, 0.88-0.98), and 10% lower for pneumonia (OR=0.90; CI, 0.85-0.96) patients.

Free Clinics is a mosaic formed by accounts of such clinics around the United States. These wide-ranging narratives-from urban to rural, from primary care to behavioral health care-provide examples that will assist other communities seeking to find the model that best fits their needs. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act has improved access to health care for many Americans, but millions remain and will remain uninsured or underinsured. Free clinics provide non-emergency care to those in need. Nationwide, professionals can be found offering volunteer services at these clinics. Contributors to this volume-typically people with personal familiarity (as clinicians or area residents) with the clinics they write about-cover a variety of topics, including a review of the literature, data-driven accounts of clinic usage, and ethical guidelines for student-run clinics. They describe the motivations of clinic staff, the day-to-day work of a family nurse practitioner working in clinics and teaching at a university, the challenges and rewards of providing health care for homeless people, and more. Student-run clinics are the topic of the second section: in addition to providing care to a small subset of those in need, student-run clinics are an important venue for training future clinicians and helping the seeds of altruism with which many enter their professions to germinate.

As such, reform in this area provides a unique opportunity to study the intersection between federal and state policy making in an area characterized by substantial uncertainty deriving from the lingering effects of the Great Recession, ongoing debate over the federal budget, and implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Invariably, states reform the way health care is delivered, regulated, and financed within broader parameters established by federal statutes and regulations. it is critical that effective strategies be put into place at each level of government if both current and future health and long-term care reform efforts are to have their greatest chances at success. Rhode Island is the first state to receive permission to operate its entire Medicaid program under a global cap. As a consequence, it has entered the national consciousness as a key data point potentially supporting the block grant approach to Medicaid reform.In this book, Edward Alan Miller draws on Rhode Island’s experiences to assess conservatives’ claims that the state’s Global Consumer Choice Compact Medicaid Waiver represents a national model for Medicaid reform. Evidence gathered from archival sources and in-depth interviews with key stakeholders exposes factors that facilitated and impeded the design and implementation of Rhode Island’s Global Waiver. These factors, in turn, suggest broader lessons for the Medicaid block grant debate and health and long-term care reform more generally; that, for example, Rhode Island’s experience does not support block granting Medicaid while highlighting the role of stakeholder engagement, provider capacity, and federal fiscal support in the implementation process.By providing a sophisticated understanding of factors enhancing or hindering state health reform, this book will contribute to improvements in the development and administration of policy development at both the state and federal levels. © 2014 Taylor & Francis."

Private health insurance premiums have increased, and state Medicaid programs have cut back coverage for adults. Concurrently, the Children's Health Insurance Program has made public insurance available to more children. We aimed to better understand how child and parent health insurance coverage patterns may have changed as a result of these policies. METHODS: We analyzed data from the nationally representative Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, comparing cohorts from 2003 and 2008. We assessed cross-sectional and full-year coverage patterns for child/parent pairs, stratified by income. We conducted chi-square tests to assess significant differences in coverage over time. RESULTS: Middle-income child/parent pairs had the most significant changes in their coverage patterns. For example, those with full-year health insurance coverage significantly decreased from 85.4% in 2003 to 80.6% in 2008. There was also an increase in uninsured middle-income child/parent pairs for the full year (5.6% in 2003 to 8.3% in 2008) and an increase in pairs who had a gap in coverage (9.7% in 2003 to 13.0% in 2008). CONCLUSIONS: The percentage of middle-income child/parent pairs who were lacking insurance, for part or all of the year, has risen, suggesting that these families may be caught between affording private coverage and being eligible for public coverage. Unless private coverage becomes more affordable, insurance instability among middle-income families may persist despite the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act."

The PCIP program was established by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA, P.L. 111-148, as amended). Under PPACA, the PCIP program is intended to help individuals with preexisting conditions who have been uninsured for six or more months to obtain health insurance coverage before 2014. In 2014, coverage will be available on a guaranteed issue basis and preexisting condition exclusions will be prohibited. To be a qualified PCIP, the insurance coverage must have an actuarial value (the average percentage of expenses that the plan covers) at least equal to 65% of total allowed costs, and out-of-pocket costs cannot exceed $5,950 for an individual in 2011. The premiums must be established at a standard rate for a standard population, and age rating cannot exceed a factor of 4 to 1. Claims and administrative costs will be subsidized by the federal government. States can run the program or elect to have the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) operate the program in their states. Slightly more than half of states (27 states) contracted to operate their own PCIPs. HHS administers the PCIPs in 23 states and the District of Columbia. PPACA appropriates $5 billion of federal funds to support the program, available from July 1, 2010, until the program ends on January 1, 2014. Originally projected to have 200,000 or more enrollees, the PCIPs had 21,454 enrollees as of April 30, 2011.

Cost will increasingly become a concern as millions more people become newly insured as a result of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA). Primary care delivery through patient-centered medical homes (PCMHs) and other coordinated-care models have improved care and reduced costs. Health plans have a strategic opportunity to promote better care at a lower cost by embracing medical homes and encouraging their growth. Health plans can play an important role in transforming the US healthcare system, as well as better position themselves for long-term corporate success. Objectives: To discuss several examples of organizations that serve a variety of beneficiaries and have been successful in promoting medical homes and coordinated primary care, and to suggest steps that health plans can take to improve the quality of care and reduce costs. Discussion: The models discussed in this article take a number of different approaches to create incentives for high-quality, cost-effective, coordinated primary care. Several health plans and groups use enhanced fee-for-service or per-member per-month payment models for primary care physician (PCP) practices that reach a specified level of medical home or electronic health record certification. Most of the examples addressed in this article also include an additional payment to encourage care management and coordination. The results showed a significant decline in costs and in the use of expensive medical services. One Medicaid coordinated-care program we reviewed saved almost $1 billion in reduced spending over 4 years, and achieves savings of approximately 15% within 6 months of the beneficiaries' enrollment into their program. Another PCMH payer program led to an approximate 28% reduction in acute care hospital admissions among Medicare beneficiaries and an approximate 38% reduction in admissions among commercial beneficiaries. Conclusion: Based on the review of real-world examples, we recommend 6 steps that health plans can use to take advantage of the opportunity to embrace medical homes as a means to improve healthcare quality and to reduce costs. These recommendations include getting feedback from PCPs to improve plan provider networks, creating value-based primary care reimbursement systems, encouraging biannual visits with high-risk patients, funding case managers for high-risk patients, considering Medicaid coordinated-care models, and promoting ACA policies that support primary care."

In general, the Medicaid law (1) raises Medicaid income eligibility levels for certain people up to 133% of the federal poverty level, (2) adds both mandatory and optional benefits to Medicaid, (3) increases the federal matching payments for certain groups of beneficiaries and for particular services provided, (4) provides new requirements and incentives for states to improve quality of care and encourage more use of preventive services, and (5) makes a number of other Medicaid program changes. Regarding CHIP, the law includes a new requirement for states to maintain their current program structures through FY2019 and extends additional CHIP funding through FY2015. To help explain the most important Medicaid and CHIP changes, provision descriptions are grouped into the following six major issue areas: eligibility, benefits, financing, program integrity, demonstrations and grant funding, and miscellaneous.Appendix A provides a detailed implementation timeline of the Medicaid and CHIP provisions. Appendix B is a crosswalk between the provision titles and the amending sections of P.L. 111-148 and P.L. 111-152 for all of the Medicaid and CHIP provisions. Finally, Appendix B is a list of abbreviations used in this report and their definitions. This report reflects the Medicaid and CHIP provisions at the time of ACA's enactment. It is meant to serve as a historical reference to the complete set of Medicaid and CHIP provisions included in the law, as of March 23, 2010. It will not be updated to capture subsequent legislative changes. © 2013 Nova Science Publishers, Inc."

The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission(MedPAC) estimated that these readmissions cost the Medicare programas much as $15 billion per year and that perhaps as much as two-thirds ofthese readmissions may be preventable. Many policymakers believe thatdifferent care transition programs coupled with payment reforms canconstrain hospital readmissions among Medicare's fee-for-service (FFS)beneficiaries, could improve patient care, and may generate cost savingsfor the program. Hospital readmissions are associated with a number offactors and are not necessarily attributable to problems with the quality ofpatient care, but strong evidence indicates specific interventions to bettermanage care transitions at the time of hospital discharge could reducereadmissions for certain conditions.Medicare is building on past work by Quality ImprovementOrganizations (QIOs) to help providers identify the underlying causes of hospital readmissions in their communities and then develop differentstrategies to prevent those rehospitalizations. In their newest round ofMedicare contracts, which began August 1, 2011, QIOs will work toreduce readmissions 20% by 2013 and provide technical assistance toparticipants in the Community Care Transitions Program (CCTP), a $500million, five-year demonstration program established by the PatientProtection and Affordable Care Act (ACA as amended, P.L. 111-148) tohelp participating hospitals improve discharge procedures and managepatients' care transitions more effectively. CCTP may be continued orexpanded if the Office of the Actuary (OACT) certifies that the expansionwould reduce Medicare spending without reducing quality. By mid-March 2012, 30 sites had been selected.As well as establishing CCTP, ACA included several paymentinitiatives to encourage FFS providers, particularly hospitals, to work tominimize rehospitalizations and coordinate patient care across settings.Two initiatives in particular are discussed in this report, the HospitalReadmission Reduction Program (HRRP) and bundled payments. TheHRRP will penalize an acute care hospital with higher than expectedreadmission rates by as much as 1% of its base payments starting inFY2013. Initially, the HRRP must use the three existing readmissionmeasures that are endorsed by the National Quality Forum (NQF) and areincluded on Medicare's Hospital COMPARE website (where publicallyreported data can be used to assess hospital performance). Hospitals andindustry advocates have expressed concerns about the existing measuresand the effect of the readmission penalties on certain safety-net hospitals;issues that are likely to attract significant Congressional attention as theprogram's implementation date approaches. CMS is also exploringbundled payment methods where a single payment is made for a definedgroup of services rather than individual payments for each service. Thenational bundled payment pilot program established by the Center forMedicaid and Medicare Innovation (CMMI) is a three-year projectstarting in 2012 that will encompass four different bundled paymentmodels. Changing these FFS financial incentives may be Medicare'smost effective strategy for addressing hospital readmissions.This report examines the complex issue of hospital readmissionsalong with Medicare's ongoing efforts and future activities to reduceunnecessary readmissions. © 2013 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

It was established in 1965 under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act to provide health insurance to individuals 65 and older, and has been expanded over the years to include permanently disabled individuals under 65. Medicare, which consists of four parts (A-D), covers hospitalizations, physician services, prescription drugs, skilled nursing facility care, home health visits, and hospice care, among other services. Generally, individuals are eligible for Medicare if they or their spouse worked for at least 40 quarters in Medicare-covered employment, are 65 years old, and are a citizen or permanent resident of the United States. Individuals may also qualify for coverage if they are a younger person with a permanent disability, have End-Stage Renal disease (permanent kidney failure requiring dialysis or transplant), or have amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease). The program is administered by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS), and by private entities that contract with CMS to provide claims processing, auditing, and quality oversight services. In FY2013, the program will cover approximately 52 million persons (43 million aged and 9 million disabled) at a total cost of about $598 billion. Spending under the program (except for a portion of administrative costs) is considered mandatory spending and is not subject to the appropriations process. Services provided under Parts A and B (also referred to as ""traditional Medicare"") are generally paid directly by the government on a ""fee-for-service"" basis, using different prospective payment systems or fee schedules. Under Parts C and D, private insurers are paid a monthly ""capitated"" amount to provide enrollees with at least a minimum standard benefit. Medicare is required to pay for all covered services provided to eligible persons, so long as specific criteria are met. Since 1965, the Medicare program has undergone considerable change. For example, during the 111th Congress, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA; P.L. 111-148 and P.L. 111- 152) made numerous changes to the Medicare program that modify provider reimbursements, provide incentives to increase the quality and efficiency of care, and enhance certain Medicare benefits. However, in the absence of further congressional action, the Medicare program is expected to be unsustainable in the long run. The Hospital Insurance (Part A) trust fund has been estimated to become insolvent in 2024. Additionally, although the Supplementary Medical Insurance (Parts B and D) trust fund is financed in large part through federal general revenues and cannot become insolvent, associated spending growth is expected to put increasing strains on the country's competing priorities. As such, Medicare is expected to be a high-priority issue in the 113th Congress, and Congress may consider a variety of Medicare reform options ranging from further modifications of provider payment mechanisms to redesigning the entire program. © 2013 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

These programs target individuals who cannot obtain or afford health insurance in the private market, primarily because of preexisting health conditions. Also, many states use their high risk pools to comply with the portability and guaranteed availability provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-191). In general, state high risk pools tend to enroll a small percentage of the uninsured. In December 2009, approximately 208,000 individuals were enrolled in high risk pools. State-established nonprofit organizations typically run these pools, with private insurance companies handling day-to-day operations, along with plan administrative staff. Although benefit packages vary across states and plans, they generally reflect health benefits that are available in the private insurance market. The majority of high risk pools cap premiums between 150% to 200% of market rates, and pools are subsidized through insurer assessments and other funding mechanisms. The Trade Act of 2002 (P.L. 107-210) appropriated a total of $100 million for FY2003-FY2004. With the expiration of authorizing legislation for federal funding of state pools, the 109th Congress took up this issue. The House passed H.R. 4519, the State High Risk Pool Funding Extension Act of 2006, which reauthorized federal grants to state high risk pools through FY2010, and changed the funding formula used for such grants. The Act authorized $15 million for seed grants and $75 million for operational and bonus grants for FY2006. The Senate passed H.R. 4519 without amendment, and it was signed into law (P.L. 109-172) on February 10, 2006. As part of the budget reconciliation process, the Senate passed S. 1932, the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (DRA) conference agreement, which provided appropriations for the grants authorized under H.R. 4519. The measure also included conforming language on enactment of H.R. 4519. The House agreed to the Senate-amended DRA bill, and it was signed it into law (P.L. 109-171) on February 8, 2006. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) awarded grants to 31 states that experienced operational losses in 2005. Of those 31 states, 25 also received bonus grants. In 2006, CMS awarded seed grants to five states, and to another five states in 2007. The 110th Congress took up the issue of extending the federal grant program by making funding available pursuant to the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2008 (P.L. 110-161). The grant funding totaled $49,127,000. In July 2008, CMS announced that 30 states received operational and bonus grants totaling $49,126,500. The 111th Congress provided $75,000,000 in appropriations for grants to state high risk pools under the Omnibus Appropriations Act of 2009 (P.L. 111-8). On September 30, 2009, CMS awarded operational grants to 31 states and bonus grants to 28 states. Furthermore, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-117) provided $55,000,000 in additional appropriations for high risk pools. In addition to state-established high risk pools, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA, P.L. 111-148), as amended, requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a temporary high risk pool program to provide health insurance coverage for certain uninsured individuals with preexisting health conditions. © 2013 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The initial intent of using MAGI was to standardize the definition of income for Medicaid eligibility purposes to reduce some of the variability and complexity that exists under the current program and to provide consistency between Medicaid and the health insurance exchange. The use of MAGI, however, has raised some concerns among Congress and the Obama Administration, as it excludes some types of income either partially or altogether. Of particular interest has been the potential impact of eligibility for Medicaid and premium credits for early retirees (aged 62 through 64) receiving Social Security benefits, as some or all of their Social Security income may be excluded from the MAGI definition of income. By excluding some types of income, individuals and families with a higher percentage of total income relative to the federal poverty level may qualify for Medicaid and premium credits. A recent cost estimate by the Congressional Budget Office finds that changing the MAGI income calculation to include all Social Security benefits would reduce the deficit by $13 billion over the 2012-2021 period. On November 21, 2011, President Obama signed into law P.L. 112-56, which will change the definition of income for these programs and include non-taxable Social Security in the definition of MAGI. The new law, however, does not address other forms of non-taxable income that are not currently in the MAGI definition. In evaluating the definition of MAGI, a number of issues might be considered. First, an alternative definition may add complexity compared with the use of MAGI. Specifically, because adjusted gross income (on which MAGI is based) can be computed largely from information on an individual's federal tax return, verification of income is streamlined. If an alternative definition is used that is not based on tax return information, the administrative complexity of verifying nontaxable income from different sources comes into play. Second, the definition was developed to ensure coordination between Medicaid and premium credits in the health insurance exchange. A change in the definition of income for Medicaid should then also apply to premium credits to ensure consistency between Medicaid and the premium credit offered to selected individuals who purchase private health insurance through the exchanges. Finally, the recent enactment of P.L. 112-56 focused largely on the inclusion of Social Security benefits in income definitions for eligibility purposes. However, most other low-income programs include other types of income (e.g., nontaxable pensions) and asset holdings that are also excluded from MAGI. © 2013 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Under ACA, Medicaid and exchanges are envisioned to work in tandem, with the potential to provide a continuous source of subsidized coverage for lower-income individuals and families, beginning in 2014. On June 28, 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a decision in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius. The Court held that the federal government cannot terminate current Medicaid program federal matching funds if a state does not expand its Medicaid program, effectively making the ACA expansion ""optional."" As a result, some states may choose not to expand their Medicaid program. Individuals who are eligible for Medicaid are not eligible for subsidies in exchange plans. Thus, some individuals in these states would not be eligible for Medicaid and could become eligible for subsidized exchange coverage, while others may remain uninsured. Individuals who receive coverage through exchange plans will likely not receive the same benefits offered by the Medicaid program, and vice versa. For example, traditional Medicaid provides a wide range of benefits to certain beneficiaries that are not typically covered in major medical plans in the private market, such as non-emergency transportation services or Early Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment (EPSDT). Exchange plans will reflect a ""typical"" private health insurance plan offered by employers, which generally includes a wide range of benefits, but not necessarily all, that are offered to various Medicaid groups of individuals. Exchange plans will be required to offer essential health benefits, which include preventive services with no cost-sharing, a benefit available to many, but not all, Medicaid beneficiaries. Thus there will likely bedifferences in available benefits for some individuals, depending on whether they are covered by Medicaid or exchange plans. In lieu of traditional Medicaid benefits, states can choose to offer an alternative set of benefits (benchmark and benchmark-equivalent coverage) that will include the essential health benefits, but only to certain groups of Medicaid beneficiaries. This alternative set of benefits has the potential to more closely align the benefits under Medicaid and the exchange for certain individuals. In addition to differences in benefits, there may also be differences with regard to the costs required of individuals. Currently, states may require certain Medicaid beneficiaries to share in the cost of services, but because of their lower income, such obligations are generally limited. Nonetheless, variation exists across the different categories of Medicaid eligibility groups with respect to costs. Similarly, ACA provides for premium and cost-sharing assistance for the purchase of exchange plans for certain lower-income individuals. However the only permissible variation across qualified individuals (or families) for these exchange subsidies is based on income. Another group for whom the alignment between Medicaid and exchanges is important is composed of individuals who are covered by Medicaid today, but who may lose Medicaid coverage when states are allowed to scale back their Medicaid program. This state ""maintenance of effort"" requirement for covering certain adults will be lifted beginning in 2014 (and in 2019 for the coverage of children). Some of these individuals will qualify for subsidies through exchange plans, while other may become uninsured. Additionally, some individuals may ""churn"" that is, they may go back and forth between Medicaid and exchange coverage, depending on their financial or other situation at the time. While some ""churning"" may be unavoidable, minimizing its effects may be critical to the health coverage of affected individuals and families. The 113th and future Congresses will likely continue to play a significant role in shaping U.S. health care policy. This report provides an analysis of some of the key similarities and differences between Medicaid and insurance plan structure in plans offered through exchanges. Because Medicaid services vary by population covered and by state, and exchanges plans can also vary by state, this report provides insight into the complexities and issues when comparing beneficiary benefits and costs to individuals for Medicaid and the exchanges. The inherent variations in Medicaid and the uncertainty about exactly how the exchanges will operate are just two of the factors that complicate a comparison. © 2013 Nova Science Publishers, Inc."
