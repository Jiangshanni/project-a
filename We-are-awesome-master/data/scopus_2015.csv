We describe and analyze those involving assisted reproductive technologies (ART). ART in the United States has been regulated in piecemeal fashion, with oversight primarily by individual states. While leaving state authority largely intact, the ACA federalized key practices by establishing essential health benefits (EHBs) that regulate insurance markets and prohibit insurance-coverage denials based on pre-existing conditions. Whatever their intentions, the ACA's drafters thus put infertility in a subtly provocative new light clinically, financially, normatively, politically, and culturally. With particular attention to normative and political dynamics embedded in plausible regulatory trajectories, we review - and attempt to preview - the ACA's effects on infertility-related delivery of health services, on ART utilization, and on reproductive medicine as a factor in American society. © 2015 Association for Politics and the Life Sciences."

Trouble was easy to foresee, as North Carolina had instituted a law barring any state agency from assisting enrollment in health-insurance plans made available through the ACA. Trained workers were needed to help citizens and legal immigrants ""navigate"" to these plans. Some of these ""navigators"" could be paid with federal funds, but many others had to work as volunteers. I was one of these volunteer navigators. Much went wrong in training, staffing, and operations, but much still was accomplished.

Might rival explanations also apply? Using a cross-sectional 50-state regression model, we studied standard political variables coupled with public-health indicators. This work differs from existing research by employing a dependent variable of five additive measures of ACA support, examining the impact of both political and socioeconomic indicators on state policy decisions. Expanding on recent empirical studies with our more nuanced additive index of support measures, we found that same-party control of a state's executive and legislative branches was indeed by far the single best predictor of policy decisions. Public-health indicators, overwhelmed by partisan effect, did not sufficiently explain state policy choice. This result does not allay the concerns that health policy has become synonymous with health politics and that health politics now has little to do with health itself. © 2015 Association for Politics and the Life Sciences."

Its durability - meaning both avoidance of outright retrenchment and fidelity to its policy aims - is thus of scholarly interest. Past literature suggests that social constructions of a policy's beneficiaries may impact durability. Questions: This paper first describes media portrayals of ACA beneficiaries with an eye toward answering three descriptive questions: (1) Do portrayals depict beneficiaries as economically heterogeneous? (2) Do portrayals focus attention on groups that have acquired new political relevance due to the ACA, such as young adults? (3) What themes that have served as messages about beneficiary ""deservingness"" in past social policy are most frequent in ACA beneficiary portrayals? The paper then assesses how the portrayal patterns that these questions uncover may work both for and against the ACA's durability, finding reasons for confidence as well as caution. Methods: Using manual and automated methods, this paper analyzes newspaper text from August 2013 through January 2014 to trace portrayals of two ACA ""target populations"" before and during the new law's first open-enrollment period: those newly eligible for Medicaid, and those eligible for subsidies to assist in the purchase of private health insurance under the ACA. This paper also studies newspaper text portrayals of two groups informally crafted by the ACA in this timeframe: those gaining health insurance and those losing it. Results: The text data uncover the following answers to the three descriptive questions for the timeframe studied: (1) Portrayals may underplay beneficiaries' economic heterogeneity. (2) Portrayals pay little attention to young adults. (3) Portrayals emphasize themes of workforce participation, economic self-sufficiency, and insider status. Health status, age, gender, and race/ethnicity appear to receive little attention. Implications and Conclusions: Existing literature suggests that these portrayal patterns may both support and limit ACA durability. In favor of durability is that ACA beneficiaries are depicted in terms that have been associated with deservingness in past American social policy - particularly being cast as workers and insiders. Yet, the results also give three reasons for caution. First, ACA insurance-losers are also portrayed as deserving. Second, it is unclear how the portrayal patterns found may impact the durability of the ACA's efforts to cut insurance disparities by age, health status, and especially race/ethnicity. Third, portrayals' strong casting of beneficiaries as workers, and limited attention to beneficiaries' economic heterogeneity and to young adults, may do little to help cultivate beneficiary political engagement around the ACA. © 2015 Association for Politics and the Life Sciences."

As Per the Affordable Care Act of 2010, hospitals may be reimbursed at a reduced rate for patients readmitted to a hospital within 30 days of discharge. In this project, we used statistical and machine-learning methods to analyze the Nationwide Inpatient Sample dataset provided by HCUP (Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project) to identify various clinical, demographic and socio-economic factors that play crucial roles in predicting the revenue loss due to readmissions. Three medical conditions, namely chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD), total hip arthroplasty (THA), and total knee arthroplasty (TKA) have been primarily used for this purpose. Our analysis builds on both non-parametric and parametric statistical models and machine learning techniques such as Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression and Neural Networks. We evaluated and compared these models based on Area under ROC (AUC) and misclassification rate. By including visual analytics, this analysis not only enables the hospitals to compute the loss of revenue but also monitors their quality of service in a real-time fashion. © 2015 IEEE."

Thereafter, the bishops were generally unsuccessful in persuading the public that contraceptive access should be restricted. Recently, however, the bishops succeeded in a campaign to restrict access to contraceptives for Catholic and non-Catholic women alike. Their lobbying and public criticism of the contraceptive mandate of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which requires employer health plans to offer preventive reproductive care coverage, forced Obama administration officials into a series of accommodations that gutted portions of the law intended to provide contraception to employees without copayment or cost sharing. In contrast to their earlier efforts to restrict reproductive freedom, the bishops successfully characterized their efforts against the ACA as a battle for religious freedom rather than against reproductive rights. This successful strategy may lead to future setbacks for women’s reproductive liberty. © 2015 by the author; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."

Concern exists that POHs increase costs and target healthier patients. However, limited historical data support these claims and are not weighed against contemporary measures of quality and patient satisfaction. The purpose of this study was to investigate the quality, costs, and efficiency across hospital types. Methods: One hundred forty-five hospitals in a single state were analyzed: 8 POHs; 16 proprietary hospitals (PHs); and 121 general, full-service acute care hospitals (ACHs). Multiyear data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Medicare Cost Report and the statewide Health Care Cost Containment Council were analyzed. Results: ACHs had a higher percentage of Medicare patients as a share of net patient revenue, with similar Medicare volume. POHs garnered significantly higher patient satisfaction: mean Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems summary rating was 4.86 (vs PHs: 2.88, ACHs: 3.10; P = .002). POHs had higher average total episode spending ($22,799 vs PHs: $18,284, ACHs: $18,856), with only $1435 of total spending on post-acute care (vs PHs: $3867, ACHs: $3378). Medicare spending per beneficiary and Medicare spending per beneficiary performance rates were similar across all hospital types, as were complication and readmission rates related to hip or knee surgery. Conclusion: POHs had better patient satisfaction, with higher total costs compared to PHs and ACHs. A focus on efficiency, patient satisfaction, and ratio of inpatient-to-post-acute care spending should be weighted carefully in policy decisions that might impact access to quality health care. © 2016 Elsevier Inc."

Such descriptions do not reflect the variability found in practices. For the purposes of this paper, the American College of Physicians (ACP) defines a direct patient contracting practice (DPCP) as any practice that directly contracts with patients to pay out-of-pocket for some or all of the services provided by the practice, in lieu of or in addition to traditional insurance arrangements, and/or charges an administrative fee to patients, sometimes called a retainer or concierge fee, often in return for a promise of more personalized and accessible care. This definition encompasses the practice types previously described. The move to DPCPs is based on the premise that access and quality of care will be improved without third-party payers imposing themselves between the patient and the physician. Yet concerns have been raised that DPCPs may cause access issues for patients who cannot afford to pay directly for care. This ACP position paper, initiated and written by its Medical Practice and Quality Committee and approved by the Board of Regents on 25 July 2015, assesses the impact of DPCPs on access, cost, and quality; discusses principles from the ACP Ethics Manual, Sixth Edition, that should apply to all practice types; and makes recommendations to mitigate any adverse effect on underserved patients. © 2015 American College of Physicians."

Survey results were compared to a prior survey conducted in the same communities prior to ACA implementation. Despite gains due to Obamacare, a much higher level of uninsurance was reported in this survey than has been reported statewide.

This issue brief suggests that the Cadillac tax is a ""blunt instrument"" for addressing these concerns because it will affect workers on a rolling timetable, does relatively little to address the regressive nature of the current exclusion, and may penalize firms and workers for cost variation that is outside their control. Replacing the current exclusion with tax credits for employer coverage that scale inversely with income might allow for regional adjustments in health care costs and eliminate aspects of the tax exclusion that favor high-income over low-income workers."

Objective: This study describes the opinions, perceptions, and comprehension of the ACA and health care reform by a cross-section of medical students in Wisconsin. Methods: A total of 578 students (35%) completed an original survey developed from previous surveys. Results: Of those sampled, one-half identified as liberal or very liberal and 20% as conservative or very conservative. Respondents were split equally in their opinions of whether the United States or other nations had the highest quality care. One-half felt that faculty physicians and the media influenced their opinion of the ACA, while two-thirds felt that coursework and peers had no influence on their views. The vast majority sampled thought everyone is entitled to adequate medical care regardless of ability to pay and that physicians have a major responsibility to help reduce health care costs. A majority of liberal students and a minority of conservative students, supported the ACA. Personal and family experience as a patient influenced most liberals to support and most conservatives to oppose the ACA. One-half felt that medical school spent adequate time on health care policy education. Conclusions: The results were used in curriculum development; these approaches may be useful to medical educators nationally. © 2015 Wisconsin Medical Society."

Although the increasing number of recommended immunizations is essential for patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the potentially uncompensated costs of expanded immunizations will present significant challenges for clinics and health systems serving HIV-infected patients. Methods. We estimated costs of providing Gardasil, Prevnar, and Zostavax to eligible patients at a US Ryan White Part C academically affiliated HIV clinic in 2013. Clinic expenditures were calculated using vaccine price and administrative fees. Revenue was calculated using insurance reimbursement data for vaccination and administration. Three scenarios were used: 100% uptake of vaccines, adjusted uptake based on published rates, and adjusted reimbursement according to pre-Affordable Care Act (ACA) insurance status. Results. 2887 patients (27% Medicare, 13% Alabama Medicaid, 26% Commercial, 34% Uninsured), received care with wide variation in immunization reimbursement ($0 to $210) by insurance and vaccine. The net yield (revenue minus expenditure) was calculated for each vaccine. Prevnar was most costly: annual net yield of -$60 691. Provision of all 3 vaccines would lead to a net yield of -$97 122. Adjusting for reduced uptake led to annual clinic losses of $44 119. Using pre-ACA reimbursement for immunization of the uninsured led to reduced clinic losses (-$62 326), attributable to reimbursement via Ryan White funds. Conclusions. A cost analysis of 3 vaccines shows great variation in insurance coverage, with potential losses of almost $100 000 for one HIV clinic if eligible patients received vaccinations in one calendar year. Adequate, cost neutral reimbursement should be instituted if medical providers and health systems are to achieve Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices immunization recommendations for both HIV positive and negative adults. © 2015 The Author 2015.

Although female sterilization is more dangerous, more expensive, and less effective than male sterilization, the Sterilization Gap incentivizes women to be sterilized rather than men. This Note argues that sterilization coverage should be extended to men. Because courts are empowered to extend underinclusive laws—like that which creates the Sterilization Gap—if they find them unconstitutional, litigation may be the best method of extending coverage. This Note presents a comprehensive argument for why the Sterilization Gap is unconstitutional and coverage should be extended. First, it argues that the Sterilization Gap is a facial sex classification because both sexes can be sterilized, even though the procedure is sex specific. Next, it argues that the classification violates constitutional equal protection law, because it is not based on a biological difference and does not remedy discrimination against women. Then, it argues that the classification was created either through impermissible oversight or gender stereotypes, and that it will perpetuate the stereotype that contraception is a woman’s responsibility, to the detriment of both sexes. Finally, it concludes by asserting that had Congress known that the Sterilization Gap was unconstitutional, it would likely have chosen to extend coverage to men rather than nullify the law, because extension would further its goals while causing comparatively little disruption to the statutory scheme. © 2015 by Gabriel Ascher."

It is unknown the extent to which obstetricians-gynecologists are aware of the Medicaid tobacco-cessation benefit. We sought to examine the awareness of the Medicaid tobacco-cessation benefit in a national sample of obstetricians-gynecologists and assessed whether reimbursement would influence their tobacco cessation practice. In 2012, a survey was administered to a national stratified-random sample of obstetricians-gynecologists (n = 252) regarding awareness of the Medicaid tobacco-cessation benefit. Results were stratified by the percentage of pregnant Medicaid patients. Chi-squared tests (p <. 0.05) were used to assess significant associations. Analyses were conducted in 2014.

This study explores FQHC primary care clinicians' beliefs and practices regarding illicit drug use assessment and treatment. Methods: We administered a 10-minute questionnaire to 68 primary care clinicians of 5 FQHCs in Los Angeles. Results: Clinicians expressed limited confidence in their ability to address patients' illicit drug use, scoring on average 3.31 on a 5-point Likert scale. Two thirds reported that they assess for drug use routinely ""at every visit"" and/or ""at annual visits."" When asked how often they counsel regarding drug use (on a 5-point Likert scale from ""never"" to ""always""), the median response was 4 (""usually""). Regarding their perspectives on the best practical resource for addressing drug use in their clinics, 45.6% named primary care clinicians. A minority (29.4%) of clinicians had completed a clinical rotation dealing with substance use, and 27.2% reported receiving more than 10hours of training regarding substance use problems. Having a substance use rotation was associated with greater confidence in drug use assessment and treatment (P<0.01). More hours of substance use training was associated with greater confidence (P=0.01) and routinely addressing substance use in their patients (P=0.04). Conclusions: Although two thirds of the surveyed clinicians assess for drug use routinely, and on average, report that they usually address drug use, clinicians' confidence in substance use care seems to be suboptimal, but both confidence and routinely addressing substance use are associated with increased substance use education.

Methods: We provided an anonymous survey to all outpatient hand surgery patients within a 1-month period at our level I academic center. The survey was structured to ascertain patients’ attitudes toward outpatient wait times as well as delivery of patient-specific healthcare-related information. One-hundred and ninety-six surveys were available for review. Results: Of the 196 patients surveyed, 106 (54 %) were between the ages of 45 and 64. Patients aged 25 to 44 were the least willing to wait for an initial outpatient appointment. The majority of patients in all age groups demonstrated unwillingness to wait more than 1 week for evaluation of a new problem. One hundred and forty patients (71 %) were willing to wait longer for an appointment with an upper extremity specialist rather than have an earlier appointment with a non-upper extremity specialist. Wait times of 30 min after arrival in the office were acceptable to 174 patients (89 %) while 40 patients (20 %) were willing to wait an hour or more. Patients preferred a typed handout detailing their specific problem as opposed to referral to a website or an e-mail containing information. Conclusions: The results of our study indicate that patients prefer typed information as opposed to e-mail or websites regarding their health care. Our study also suggests that patients are willing to endure longer wait times if they can be given a sooner appointment, and most prefer a specialist for their problems.

To gauge the likely implications of the national policy we analyze how the Massachusetts Health Care Reform Act impacted various hospitalization outcomes in each of the 25 major diagnostic categories (MDC). Methods: We utilize a difference-in-difference approach to identify the impact of the Massachusetts reform on insurance coverage and patient outcomes. This identification is achieved using six years of data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project. We report MDC-specific estimates of the impact of the reform on insurance coverage and type as well as length of stay, number of diagnoses, and number of procedures. Results: The requirement of universal insurance coverage increased the probability of being covered by insurance. This increase was in part a result of an increase in the probability of being covered by Medicaid. The percentage of admissions covered by private insurance fell. The number of diagnoses rose as a result of the law in the vast majority of diagnostic categories. Our results related to length of stay suggest that looking at aggregate results hides a wealth of information. The most disparate outcomes were pregnancy related. The length of stay for new-born babies and neonates rose dramatically. In aggregate, this increase serves to mute decreases across other diagnoses. Also, the number of procedures fell within the MDCs for pregnancy and child birth and that for new-born babies and neonates. Conclusions: The Massachusetts Health Care Reform appears to have been effective at increasing insurance take-up rates. These increases may have come at the cost of lower private insurance coverage. The number of diagnoses per admission was increased by the policy across nearly all MDCs. Understanding the changes in length of stay as a result of the Massachusetts reform, and perhaps the Affordable Care Act, requires MDC-specific analysis. It appears that the most important distinction to make is to differentiate care related to new-born babies and neonates from that related to other diagnostic categories. © 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland."

Net of known predictors of trust at the individual and country level, we find that trust in government is significantly lower where the health system is financed to a greater degree by private sources. This negative relationship occurs because in countries with more private financing, low-income citizens perceive themselves to be at greater risk for not receiving needed health care. This perception of risk is associated with more negative evaluations of the performance of the health care system, which in turn is associated with less trust in government. When states do less to ensure the basic health care needs of members of society who are at greatest risk, these citizens may come to place less trust in government institutions. Hence, the increasing pressure on European governments to privatize the financing of health care in the wake of the financial crisis that is also characterized by growing income inequality threatens to make citizens trust government less. At the same time, implementation of the Affordable Care Act could signal a renaissance for political trust in the United States, if a growing role in the health care system is accompanied by a redistribution of risk. © American Political Science Association 2015."

We measure subunit service availability using a comprehensive data source available for all 67 county health departments in the provision of diagnostic care and primary health care. In this research we aim to address two related research questions. First, we structure our analysis so as to fix budgets. This is based on the assumption that State spending on social and health services could be limited, but patient needs are not. Our second research question is that, given the dearth of primary care providers in Florida if budgets are allowed to vary is there enough medical labor to provide care to clients. Using a non-parametric approach, we also apply bootstrapping to the concept of plant capacity which adds to the productivity research. To preview our findings, we report that there exists excess plant capacity for patient treatment and care, but question whether resources may be better suited for more traditional types of public health services. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York."

Principal Findings Medicaid expansions significantly increased health insurance coverage and reduced out-of-pocket spending on mental health services for low-income adults. Effects of expanded Medicaid eligibility on out-of-pocket spending were strongest for adults with psychological distress.

This health policy brief is focused on the benefits of integrating CHWs specifically into the patient-centered medical home (PCMH). CHWs in the PCMH can serve as primary providers of culturally relevant information and advocacy, assist providers in understanding the influence of patients’ environment on disease management, and enhance motivation for self-care management among patients with chronic diseases. Despite the important role of CHWs, there are some barriers to integration into existing systems of care.

I use a large data set of 176 counties over 7 years, including 3 years of pre-expansion period, 1 year of implementation year, and 3 years of post-expansion period.

I also observe a 0.49 % increase in Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) enrollment after the Medicaid expansions. These results are robust to an alternative identification of the most-affected counties, inclusion of counties from comparison states, limiting the control group to only high-poverty counties from comparison states, exclusion of county-specific time trends, and different configuration of clustered errors.

Methods: The 2010-2012 nationally representative Medical Expenditure Panel Survey data were analyzed in 2015 to compare 9755 low-income adults aged 18-64 years from Medicaidexpanding states with 7455 adults from nonexpanding states. Multivariate logistic regression models were fitted to evaluate the differences in access to care, receipt of preventive services, quality of care, attitudes about health and self-reported health status by Medicaid expansion status. The differences in care utilization and medical expenditures between the two groups were examined using a 2-part modeling approach. Results: Compared to their counterparts in Medicaid expansion states, low income adults in the nonexpanding states were more likely to be black and reside in rural areas and were less likely to have a usual source of care (prevalence ratio[PR] 0.86, 95% confidence interval[CI] 0.82-0.91) and recommended preventive services such as dental checkups (PR = 0.86; CI = 0.79-0.94), routine checks (PR = 0.89; CI = 0.83-0.95), flu vaccinations (PR = 0.89; CI = 0.81-0.98), and blood pressure checks (PR = 0.96; CI = 0.94-0.99). They also had less care utilization, fewer prescriptions, and less medical expenditures, but more out-of-pocket expenditures (all p-value >0.05). Conclusions: Low-income adults in Medicaid nonexpanding states, who are disproportionately represented by blacks and rural residents, were worse off for multiple health-related outcomes compared to their counterparts in Medicaid expanding states at the baseline of ACA implementation, suggesting that low income adults residing in nonexpanding states may benefit markedly from the expansion of Medicaid. © 2015 Han et al.

We compared the outcomes of care for patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) seen in practices with NPs or PAs and rheumatologists versus practices with rheumatologists only. Methods We enrolled 7 rheumatology practices in the US (4 with NPs or PAs and 3 without). RA disease activity (categorized as in remission, low, moderate, or high, using standardized measures) was abstracted from medical records from the most recent 2 years. We performed a repeated-measures analysis using generalized linear regression to compare disease activity for visits to practices with NPs or PAs versus rheumatologist-only practices, adjusting for disease duration, serologic status, RA treatments, and disease activity measures. Results Records from 301 patients, representing 1,982 visits, were reviewed. The patients' mean age was 61 years and 77% were female. In the primary adjusted analysis, patients seen in practices with NPs or PAs were less likely to have higher disease activity (odds ratio 0.32, 95% confidence interval 0.17-0.60; P = 0.004) than those seen in rheumatologist-only practices. However, there were no differences in the change in disease activity.

However, there are several barriers to incorporating robust risk assessments into routine care. MeTree, a web-based patient-facing health risk assessment tool, was developed with the aim of overcoming these barriers. In order to better understand what factors will be instrumental for broader adoption of risk assessment programs like MeTree in clinical settings, we obtained funding to perform a type III hybrid implementation-effectiveness study in primary care clinics at five diverse healthcare systems. Here, we describe the study's protocol. Methods/design: MeTree collects personal medical information and a three-generation family health history from patients on 98 conditions. Using algorithms built entirely from current clinical guidelines, it provides clinical decision support to providers and patients on 30 conditions. All adult patients with an upcoming well-visit appointment at one of the 20 intervention clinics are eligible to participate. Patient-oriented risk reports are provided in real time. Provider-oriented risk reports are uploaded to the electronic medical record for review at the time of the appointment. Implementation outcomes are enrollment rate of clinics, providers, and patients (enrolled vs approached) and their representativeness compared to the underlying population. Primary effectiveness outcomes are the percent of participants newly identified as being at increased risk for one of the clinical decision support conditions and the percent with appropriate risk-based screening. Secondary outcomes include percent change in those meeting goals for a healthy lifestyle (diet, exercise, and smoking). Outcomes are measured through electronic medical record data abstraction, patient surveys, and surveys/qualitative interviews of clinical staff. Discussion: This study evaluates factors that are critical to successful implementation of a web-based risk assessment tool into routine clinical care in a variety of healthcare settings. The result will identify resource needs and potential barriers and solutions to implementation in each setting as well as an understanding potential effectiveness.

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act expanded the program significantly, but the extent to which the availability of CHCs improve access to care in general is not clear. In this paper, we examine the associations between the availability of CHC services in communities and two key measures of ambulatory care access - having a usual source of care and having any office-based medical visits over a one year period. Methods: We pooled six years of data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (2008-2013) and linked it to geographic data on CHCs from Health Resources and Services Administration's Health Center Program Uniform Data System. We also link other community characteristics from the Area Health Resource File and the Dartmouth Institute's data files. The associations between CHC availability and our access measures are estimated with logistic regression models stratified by insurance status. Results: The availability of CHC services was positively associated with both measures of access among those with no insurance coverage. Additionally, it was positively associated with having a usual source of care among those with Medicaid and private insurance. These findings persist after controlling for key individual- and community-level characteristics. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that an enhanced CHC program could be an important resource for supporting the efficacy of expanded Medicaid coverage under the Affordable Care Act and, ultimately, improving access to quality primary care for underserved Americans. © 2017."

Objective We sought to characterize homeless persons' knowledge of the ACA, identify barriers to their ACA enrollment, and determine access to various forms of communication that could be used to facilitate enrollment. Methods At an urban county Level I trauma center, we interviewed all noncritically ill adults who presented to the emergency department (ED) during daytime hours and were able to provide consent. We assessed access to communication, awareness of the ACA, insurance status, and barriers preventing subjects from enrolling in health insurance and compared homeless persons' responses with concomitantly enrolled housed individuals. Results Of the 650 enrolled subjects, 134 (20.2%) were homeless. Homeless subjects were more likely to have never heard of the ACA (26% vs. 10%). ""Not being aware if they qualify for Medicaid"" was the most common (70%) and most significant (30%) barrier to enrollment reported by uninsured homeless persons. Of homeless subjects who were unsure if they qualified for Medicaid, 91% reported an income < 138% of the federal poverty level, likely qualifying them for enrollment. Although 99% of housed subjects reported access to either phone or internet, only 74% of homeless subjects reported access. Conclusions Homeless persons report having less knowledge of the ACA than their housed counterparts, poor understanding of ACA qualification criteria, and limited access to phone and internet.

Materials and Methods Using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample we performed a retrospective cohort study of patients who underwent inpatient urological surgeries from 2007 through 2011. We defined the safety net burden of each hospital based on the proportion of Medicaid and self-pay discharges. We examined the distribution of urological procedures performed and compared in-hospital mortality, prolonged length of stay and costs in the highest quartile of burden (safety net) vs the lowest quartile (nonsafety net). Results The distribution of urological procedures differed by safety net status with less benign prostate surgery (9.1% safety net vs 11.4% nonsafety net) and major cancer surgery (26.9% vs 34.3%), and more reconstructive surgery (8.1% vs 5.5%) at safety net facilities (p <0.001). Higher mortality at safety net hospitals was seen for nephrectomy (OR 1.68, 95% CI 1.15-2.45) and transurethral resection of the prostate (OR 2.17, 95% CI 1.22-3.87). Patients in safety net hospitals demonstrated greater prolonged length of stay after endoscopic stone surgery (OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.01-1.41). Costs were similar across procedures except for radical prostatectomy and cystectomy. For these procedures the average admission was more expensive at nonsafety net facilities (prostatectomy $11,457 vs $9,610 and cystectomy $27,875 vs $24,048, each p <0.02). Conclusions Reductions in funding to safety net hospitals with health care reform could adversely impact access to care for patients with a broad range of urological conditions, potentially exacerbating existing disparities for vulnerable populations served by these facilities. © 2015 American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc."

The MyNewOptions study is a three-arm, randomized, controlled trial testing web-based interventions aimed at assisting privately insured women with making contraceptive choices that are consistent with their reproductive goals. Methods: Privately insured women between the ages of 18 and 40 not intending pregnancy were randomly assigned to one of three groups: 1) a reproductive life planning (RLP) intervention, 2) a reproductive life planning enriched with contraceptive action planning (RLP+) intervention, or 3) an information only control group. Both the RLP and RLP+ guide women to identify their individualized reproductive goals and contraceptive method requirements. The RLP+ additionally includes a contraceptive action planning component, which uses if-then scenarios that allow the user to problem solve situations that make it difficult to be adherent to their contraceptive method. All three groups have access to a reproductive options library containing information about their contraceptive coverage and the attributes of alternative contraceptive methods. Women completed a baseline survey with follow-up surveys every 6 months for 2 years concurrent with intervention boosters. Study outcomes include contraceptive use and adherence.

Study Design: This was a subgroup analysis of 324 women enrolled in a randomized, controlled trial to receive or not receive an educational LARC script during their postpartum hospitalization. Participants in this subgroup analysis stated that they were either using LARC (n = 114) or interested in using LARC (n = 210) during a follow-up survey completed after their scheduled 6-week postpartum visit. Modified Poisson regression analysis was used to assess for characteristics associated with using LARC by the time of the follow-up survey. Results: Women who were interested in LARC but not using it were more likely to be multiparous (relative risk [RR], 1.59; 95% CI, 1.19-2.11) and to have missed their postpartum visit (RR, 25.88; 95% CI, 3.75-178.44) compared with those using LARC. Among the interested 210 who were not using LARC, the most common reasons provided for non-use were that they were told to come back for another insertion visit (45%), missed the postpartum visit (26%), and could not afford LARC (11%). The most common contraceptive methods used instead of LARC were barrier methods (42%) and abstinence (19%); 18% used no contraceptive method. Conclusion: Two-thirds (65%) of postpartum women who desired to use LARC did not receive it in the postpartum period and used less effective contraceptive methods. Increasing access to immediate postpartum LARC and eliminating two-visit protocols for LARC insertion may increase postpartum LARC use. As the Affordable Care Act moves toward full implementation, it is necessary to understand the barriers that prevent interested patients from receiving LARC. © 2015 Jacobs Institute of Women's Health."

To the extent they appear, it is largely as acted-upon entities that bear the fall out from the congressional-presidential confrontations that polarization fuels, or as the tools of presidential unilateralism. This failure to incorporate administrative agencies into polarization accounts is a major omission. Agencies possess broad grants of preexisting authority that they can use to reshape governing policy and law, often at presidential instigation, thereby puttingpressure on Congress to respond. In theprocess, they can construct new alliances and arrangements that have the potential to break through partisan divides and alter the political landscape. This Essay, written in honor of Peter Strauss, aims to deepen current understanding of the relationship between administrative agencies and political polarization. Using Professor Strauss’s insight that agencies exist in a web of control relationships as a launching point, the Essay probes how polarization affects these control relationships and the extent to which agencies can develop policy and potentially reshape partisan divides. Yet focusing simply on the forces empoweringor constraining agencies at the federal level misses the critical element of state participation in federal programs and federal regulation. Such state involvement injects a political edge into program implementation and provides a potential mechanism for checking executive branch unilateralism at the same time that it opens up opportunities for bipartisanship.

In the next 1 to 3 years, 21.3% plan to cut back on hours, 14.2% plan to cut back on patients seen, and 12.6% plan to switch to a cash practice. Medicine and healthcare are changing in such a way that 33.9% concur that they will accelerate their retirement plans. Conclusions Headache medicine specialists have one of the highest rates of burnout compared to other physician specialists, which is twice the rate of working adults. Physicians' age and practice environment and experience are related with their career satisfaction and professional burnout. Some attributes of career satisfaction can decrease burnout by reducing emotional exhaustion and depersonalization and by enhancing personal accomplishment. There is widespread dissatisfaction with the practice environment. These findings may portend decreasing access to headache medicine specialists in the future if specialists cut back on hours and patients seen, accelerate their retirement plans, and fewer neurologists are attracted to headache medicine. © 2015 American Headache Society."

It is now more important than ever to understand the needs of students who are preparing for roles as health care providers. The purpose of this study was to describe and analyze the American College of Nurse-Midwives (ACNM) Student Reports from 2005 through 2014 to acquire a better understanding of student needs in light of the historic change in health care reform. Methods: A document analysis was conducted to review and evaluate 10 student reports using qualitative content analysis. Data were coded, categories were formed, and themes were discovered. The interpretation of the student reports elicited meaning, gained understanding, and developed empirical knowledge. Results: Eight themes emerged from the data contained in the 10 student reports. These were: 1) public awareness and marketing; 2) midwifery education; 3) funding for midwifery education; 4) preceptor issues; 5) communication and professional issues; 6) diversity and inclusion; 7) transition to practice; and 8) the ACNM Annual Meeting. Discussion: Students bring a unique perspective to the profession of midwifery and ACNM. This study revealed 8 themes emanating from the student reports spanning 10 years. Each theme showcased in this study is presented through a student lens and was deemed important enough to be mentioned in the majority of the student reports. These themes identify key areas affecting students such as education program content and clinical experiences, diversity and inclusion, preceptor availability and relationships, funding for graduate school and for attending the ACNM Annual Meeting, and a myriad of other significant topics. These students will begin their new careers with the changing structure of the health care industry under the ACA. At this complex and vulnerable time, it is imperative that student voices be heard and that their professional organization remains receptive to their concerns. A continuing dialogue between students and midwifery leadership, faculty, and preceptors will be beneficial to move our profession in the direction of achieving access to high-quality health care for all. © 2015 by the American College of Nurse-Midwives."

The late Barbara Starfield theorized that Canada's greater primary care-orientation also plays a critically protective role. We tested the resultant Starfield-Gorey theory by examining the effects of poverty, health insurance and physician supplies, primary care and specialists, on colon cancer care in Ontario and California. Methods: We analyzed registry data for people with non-metastasized colon cancer from Ontario (n = 2,060) and California (n = 4,574) diagnosed between 1996 and 2000 and followed to 2010. We obtained census tract-based socioeconomic data from population censuses and data on county-level physician supplies from national repositories: primary care physicians, gastroenterologists and other specialists. High poverty neighborhoods were oversampled and the criterion was 10 year survival. Hypotheses were explored with standardized rate ratios (RR) and tested with logistic regression models. Results: Significant inverse associations of poverty (RR = 0.79) and inadequate health insurance (RR = 0.80) with survival were observed in the California, while they were non-significant or non-existent in Ontario. The direct associations of primary care physician (RRs of 1.32 versus 1.11) and gastroenterologist (RRs of 1.56 versus 1.15) supplies with survival were both stronger in Ontario than California. The supply of primary care physicians took precedence. Probably mediated through the initial course of treatment, it largely explained the Canadian advantage. Conclusions: Poverty and health insurance were more predictive in the USA, community physician supplies more so in Canada. Canada's primary care protections were greatest among the most socioeconomically vulnerable. The protective effects of Canadian health care prior to enactment of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) clearly suggested the following. Notwithstanding the importance of insuring all, strengthening America's system of primary care will probably be the best way to ensure that the ACA's full benefits are realized. Finally, Canada's strong primary care system ought to be maintained. © 2015 Gorey et al."

Both laws also aimed to promote consumer understanding of how to acquire, maintain and use these public plans. A prior study found an association between the level of cost-sharing required in these plans and the affordability of care. Preparatory to a quantitative study we conducted this qualitative study that aimed to examine (1) whether cost sharing levels built into the public insurance types that formed the backbone of the MA health reform led to unaffordability of care and if so, (2) how insurances with higher cost sharing levels led to unaffordability of care in this context. Methods: We interviewed 12 consumers obtaining the most commonly obtained insurances under MA health reform (Medicaid and Commonwealth Care) at a safety net hospital emergency department. We purposefully interviewed a stratified sample of higher and low cost sharing recipients. We used a combination of inductive and deductive codes to analyze the data according to degree of cost-sharing required by different insurance types. Results: We found that higher cost sharing plans led to unaffordability of care, as evidenced by unmet medical needs, difficulty affording basic non-medical needs due to expenditures on medical care, and reliance on non-insurance resources to pay for care. Participants described two principal mechanisms by which higher cost sharing led to unaffordability of care: (1) cost sharing above what their incomes allowed and (2) poor understanding of how to effectively acquire, maintain and utilize insurance new public plans. Conclusions: Further efforts to investigate the relationship between perceived affordability of care and understanding of insurance for the insurance types obtained under MA health reform may be warranted. A potential focus for further work may be quantitative investigation of how the level of calibration of cost-sharing to income and understanding of insurances under the MA reform was associated with perceived affordability of care. © 2015 Zallman et al."

This commentary stems from our prior policy research, which examined the extent to which the health care needs of adolescents were being considered in the early implementation phases of the ACA. This study was informed by a literature review and interviews with health care administrators, health policy researchers, and adolescent medicine specialists. The ACA has significantly expanded health insurance access; however, inequities in coverage and access remain. Primarily, the structure and financing of adolescent health care needs to be improved to better support the delivery of patient-centered, comprehensive care for this special population. Additionally, improvements in youths’ awareness of their benefits under the ACA as well as a greater appreciation of preventive visits are critical. Furthermore, an unanticipated consequence of the ACA is that it exacerbates the risk of confidentiality breaches through explanation of benefits and electronic health records, which can compromise adolescents’ access and utilization of health care services. Greater attention to improving and sustaining health promoting behaviors within the context of the ACA is critical for it to truly have a positive impact on adolescent health. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York."

Bariatric surgery coverage is not considered an essential health benefit in 28 state exchanges, and this lack of coverage has a discriminatory and detrimental impact on millions of Americans participating in state exchanges that do not provide bariatric surgery coverage. Objectives: We examined 3 state exchanges in which a portion of their plans provided coverage for bariatric surgery to determine if bariatric surgery coverage is correlated with premium costs. Setting: State health exchanges; United States. Methods: Data from the 2015 state exchange plans were analyzed using information from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' Individual Market Landscape file and Benefits and Cost Sharing public use files. Results: Only 3 states (Oklahoma, Oregon, and Virginia) in the analysis have 1 or more rating regions in which a portion of the plans cover bariatric surgery. In Oklahoma and Oregon, the average monthly premiums for all bronze, silver, and gold coverage levels are higher for plans covering bariatric surgery. Only 1 of these states included platinum plans that cover bariatric surgery. The average difference in premiums was between $1 to $45 higher in Oklahoma, and $18 to $32 higher in Oregon. Conversely, in Virginia, the average monthly premiums are between $2 and $21 lower for each level for plans covering bariatric surgery. Monthly premiums for plans covering versus not covering bariatric surgery ranged from 6% lower to 15% higher in the same geographic rating region.

Results indicate that greater ACO use of patient activation and engagement (PAE) activities at the point-of-care may be related to positive perceptions among ACO leaders of the impact of PAE investments on ACO costs, quality, and outcomes of care.

The author describes how current ""value-based purchasing"" initiatives fail to address the underlying problems in fee-for-service payment and can be particularly problematic for academic health centers (AHCs). Bundled payments, warranties, and condition-based payments can correct the problems with fee-for-service payments and enable physicians and hospitals to redesign care delivery without causing financial problems for themselves. However, the author explains several specific actions that are needed to ensure that payment reforms can be a ""win-win-win"" for patients, purchasers, and AHCs: (1) disconnecting funding for teaching and research from payment for service delivery, (2) providing predictable payment for essential hospital services, (3) improving the quality and efficiency of care at AHCs, and (4) supporting collaborative relationships between AHCs and community providers by allowing each to focus on their unique strengths and by paying AHC specialists to assist community providers in diagnosis and treatment. With appropriate payment reforms and a commitment by AHCs to redesign care delivery, medical education, and research, AHCs could provide the leadership needed to improve care for patients, lower costs for health care purchasers, and maintain the financial viability of both AHCs and community providers.

Such costs were analyzed through 24 semi-structured interviews with physicians and hospital administrators in a multiple-case, inductive study. Two extreme types of physician-hospital arrangements were examined: An employed model (ie, integrated salary model, a group of physicians integrated by a hospital system) and a private practice (ie, a physician or group of physicians who are independent of economic or policy control). Interviews noted that integration leads to 3 evident costs, namely, monitoring, coordination, and cooperation costs. Improving our understanding of the kinds of costs that are incurred after physician-hospital integration will help hospitals and physicians to avoid common failures after integration.

These data predate the major insurance provisions of the Affordable Care Act. In 2013, the U.S. spent far more on health care than these other countries. Higher spending appeared to be largely driven by greater use of medical technology and higher health care prices, rather than more frequent doctor visits or hospital admissions. In contrast, U.S. spending on social services made up a relatively small share of the economy relative to other countries. Despite spending more on health care, Americans had poor health outcomes, including shorter life expectancy and greater prevalence of chronic conditions."

Using data from the March Current Population Survey from 1995 to 2003, our findings suggest that the introduction of MMC increases the likelihood of being uninsured and decreases formal Medicaid participation. This finding is consistent with an increase in ""conditional coverage, "" waiting until medical care is needed to sign up or re-enroll in Medicaid. These effects are concentrated among low-income children and absent for high-income children. We find no evidence of ""crowd-in, "" substituting private coverage for Medicaid.

Elites encouraging distrust interact with grassroots movements, which they can only loosely direct and control. Identifying four strategic benefits of distrust: organizational, electoral, institutional and policy, the paper discusses how Republicans and conservative movement organizations in the Tea Party age used distrust to develop groups and achieve coherence, try to influence primaries and win elections, argue for the constitutional powers of institutions they control, and seek to influence public policy. Paying special attention to health policy, we examine how, after distrust was successfully used to thwart President Bill Clinton's proposed reforms, it was employed to try to stop and then to exact a price for President Barack Obama's passage of the Affordable Care Act. While Tea Party rhetoric and current streams of distrust are often associated with racialized messages and anti-Obama sentiment, we contend they are likely to persist after Obama leaves office, particularly given the Tea Party's comfort with ungovernability and long-standing conservative use of government distrust. © 2015 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston."

In this brief, cumulative county-level enrollment in HIMs through March 2015 is presented for state HIMs operated as Federally Facilitated Marketplaces (FFMs) and Federally Supported State-Based Marketplaces (FS-SBMs). We provide comparisons between enrollment in urban and rural areas of each state and corresponding percentages of ""potential market"" participants enrolled. Given differences in populations eligible for HIM enrollment, we analyzed Medicaid expansion states separately. This analysis provides a gauge of how well outreach and enrollment efforts are proceeding in the states. Key Findings. (1) Overall, people living in metropolitan areas were more likely to enroll in HIMs than were people in non-metropolitan areas, as 38.9 percent of potentially eligible metropolitan residents in Medicaid expansion states and 47.5 percent in non-expansion states were enrolled in HIMs, compared to 33.9 percent and 37.3 percent in nonmetropolitan areas, respectively. (2) Estimated enrollment rates varied considerably across the United States. In particular, estimated enrollment rates in non-metropolitan areas are higher than in metropolitan areas in Illinois, Maine, Michigan, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. (3) The states with the highest rural enrollment percentages were Maine, Michigan, Montana, North Carolina, New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Wisconsin. States with high absolute rural enrollment were about as likely to be Medicaid expansion states to be as non-expansion states, and they were slightly less likely to belong to the South census region."

About half of this cost arose from the deductions for charitable contributions with the other half from exemptions of earnings of nonprofits. In 2010, the deduction for charitable contributions resulted in an estimated 40 billion in federal revenue losses. On average, endowment investments in 2009 experienced losses, meaning that the federal government did not lose revenues from exempting asset returns from taxation. By 2011, these returns on endowments almost recovered to their prior levels, although they fell to approximately zero for 2012. Over the longer run, however, they are likely to earn a substantial return. This report provides an overview of recent changes affecting taxexempt and charitable organizations, while also discussing issues that may be of legislative interest in the future. The Pension Protection Act (P.L. 109-280) included a number of restrictions related to charitable contributions as well as restrictions on tax-exempt organizations. These changes are briefly surveyed. In addition to changes regarding the treatment of charitable contributions and tax-exempt organizations that have been made in recent years, several issues may be considered in future legislation. A number of provisions related to charitable contributions were extended temporarily as part of the tax extenders in the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (P.L. 112-240). Most of the charitable extenders were contained in legislation first introduced in 2001. Some provisions were enacted temporarily in 2005; further provisions and extensions occurred in 2006, in the Pension Protection Act. These extenders include an individual retirement account (IRA) rollover, liberalized treatment of gifts of food inventory and conservation property, and two more technical provisions. Limitations on itemized deductions have been proposed as part of the Fiscal Commission's recommendation. President Obama's budgets have proposed limiting itemized deductions' value, including charitable contributions, to 28. Other types of limits may be considered as part of tax reform. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA; P.L. 111-148), in response to concerns regarding charity care and community benefits provided by tax-exempt hospitals, imposed new regulations. Other issues that may arise reflect concerns about donor-advised funds and supporting organizations and educational institutions endowments. For donor-advised funds and supporting organizations, the main issue is whether and how minimum distribution requirements should be imposed, alongside other new regulations. The decline in educational institutions' endowments had raised concerns that such declines may lead to tuition increases, although these assets have largely recovered. New reporting requirements for small tax-exempt organizations, enacted under the Pension Protection Act (P.L. 109-280) may cause a number of noncompliant tax-exempt entities to lose their tax-exempt status. © 2015 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Then, a case study serves to demonstrate an ABMS application and gains from knowledge that is unique to this systems social science approach.

To increase knowledge of HIV status, CDC guidelines seek to make HIV screening a routine part of medical care. This paper examines how routinely California primary care providers test for HIV and how providers' knowledge of California's streamlined testing requirements, use of sexual histories, and having an electronic medical record prompt for HIV testing, relate totestoffers. Methods: We surveyed all ten California health plans offered under health reform's Insurance Exchange (response rate = 50%) and 322 primary care providers to those plans (response rate = 19%) to assess use of HIV screening and risk assessments. Results: Only 31.7% of 60 responding providers reported offering HIV tests to all or most new enrollees and only 8.8% offered an HIV test of blood samples all or most of the time despite the California law requiring that providers offer HIV testing of blood samples in primary care settings. Twenty-eight of the 60 providers (46.6%) were unaware that California had reduced barriers to HIV screening by eliminating the requirement for written informed consent and pre-test counseling. HIV screening of new enrollees all or most of the time was reported by 53.1% of the well-informed providers, but only 7.1% of the less informed providers, a difference of 46 percentage points (95% CI: 21.0%-66.5%). Providers who routinely obtained sexual histories were 29 percentage points (95% CI: 0.2%-54.9%) more likely to screen for HIV all or most of the time than those who did not ask sexual histories. Conclusion: Changing HIV screening requirements is important, but not sufficient to make HIV testing a routine part of medical care. Provider education to increase knowledge about the changed HIV testing requirements could positively impact testing rates. © 2015 Leibowitz et al."

We estimate an empirical model that explains county-level ACO entry as a function of: physician, hospital, and insurance market structure; demographics; and other economic and regulatory factors. We find that physician concentration by organization has little effect. In contrast, physician concentration by geographic site—which is a new measure of locational concentration of physicians—discourages ACO entry. Hospital concentration generally has a negative effect. HMO penetration is a strong predictor of ACO entry, while physician-hospital organizations have little effect. Small markets discourage entry, which suggests economies of scale for ACOs.

Implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act provides an opportunity to expand DSM education and support to many people who are currently excluded from such services due to lack of insurance coverage, current policy barriers, or simple failure of healthcare systems to provide them. Extending the range and provision of such services could translate into reduced diabetic complications, a reduction in unnecessary healthcare utilization, and significant health-related cost savings on a national level. SBM recommends that public and private insurers be required to reimburse for 12 h of DSM education and support annually for anyone with diabetes.

Increasing coverage could raise hospital revenue and reduce the need to shift costs to insured patients. The consequences of ACA on hospital revenues could be examined if payments were known for most hospitals in the United States. Actual payment data are considered confidential, however, and only charges are widely available. Payment-to-charge ratios (PCRs), which convert hospital charges to an estimated payment, have been estimated for hospitals in 10 states. Here we evaluated whether PCRs can be predicted for hospitals in states that do not provide detailed financial data. Methods: We predicted PCRs for 5 payer categories for over 1,000 community hospitals in 10 states as a function of state, market, hospital, and patient characteristics. Data sources included the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) State Inpatient Databases, HCUP Hospital Market Structure file, Medicare Provider of Service file, and state information from several sources. We performed out-of-sample prediction to determine the magnitude of prediction errors by payer category. Results: Many individual, hospital, and state factors were significant predictors of PCRs. Root mean squared error of prediction ranged from 32 to over 100 % of the mean and varied considerably by which states were included or predicted. The cost-to-charge ratio (CCR) was highly correlated with PCRs for Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurance but not for self-pay or other insurance categories. Conclusions: Inpatient payments can be estimated with modest accuracy for community hospital stays funded by Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurance. They improve upon CCRs by allowing separate estimation by payer type. PCRs are currently the only approach to estimating fee-for-service payments for privately insured stays, which represent a sizable proportion of stays for individuals under age 65. Additional research is needed to improve the predictive accuracy of the models for all payers. © 2015 Smith et al."

Medicaid also enjoys support for its long term care services. Yet these programs are likely to face potential changes as faith in government and willingness to support the revenues necessary to sustain Medicare and Medicaid once again receive scrutiny. The aging of the Baby Boom population will continue to keep financing concerns near the forefront of debates over the federal budget even though some slowdown in growth has been achieved in recent years.

At higher incomes, the phase-out of the subsidies means that adults in marketplace plans have higher premium costs than those in employer plans. Overall, larger shares of adults in marketplace plans reported deductibles of $1,000 or more, compared with those in employer plans, though these differences were narrower among low-and moderate-income adults."

Methods: We evaluated changes in the use of recommended preventive services from 2009 (before the implementation of ACA cost-sharing provision) to 2011/2012 (after the implementation) in the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, a nationally representative household interview survey in the US. Specifically, we examined: blood pressure check, cholesterol check, flu vaccination, and cervical, breast, and colorectal cancer screening, controlling for demographic characteristics and stratifying by insurance type. Results: There were 64,280 (21,310 before and 42,970 after the implementation of ACA cost-sharing provision) adults included in the analyses. Receipt of recent blood pressure check, cholesterol check and flu vaccination increased significantly from 2009 to 2011/2012, primarily in the privately insured population aged 18-64. years, with adjusted prevalence ratios (95% confidence intervals) 1.03 (1.01-1.05) for blood pressure check, 1.13 (1.09-1.18) for cholesterol check and 1.04 (1.00-1.08) for flu vaccination (all p-values. <. 0.05). However, few changes were observed for cancer screening. We observed little change in the uninsured population. Conclusions: These early observations suggest positive benefits from the ACA policy of eliminating cost-sharing for some preventive services. Future research is warranted to monitor and evaluate longer term effects of the ACA on access to care and health outcomes. © 2015 Elsevier Inc."

Drawing on discussions with policymakers, insurers, and brokers, we examine how these supported state-run marketplaces perform their key functions.

Design: Qualitative study using a community-partnered participatory research framework. Setting: Community forum breakout discussion. Discussants: Representatives from LA County health care agencies, community health care provider organizations, local community advocacy and service organizations including uninsured individuals, and the county school district. Main Outcome Measures: Key structural and overarching value themes identified through community-partnered pile sort, c-coefficients measuring overlap between themes. Results: Five overarching value themes were identified - knowledge, trust, quality, partnership, and solutions. Lack of knowledge and misinformation were identified as barriers to successful enrollment of the eligible uninsured and providing health care to undocumented individuals. Discussants noted dissatisfaction with the quality of traditional sources of health care and a broken cycle of trust and disengagement. They also described inherent trust by the uninsured in ""outsider"" community-based providers not related to quality. Conclusions: Improving health care for the residually uninsured after ACA implementation will require addressing dissatisfaction in safety-net providers, disseminating knowledge and providing health care through trusted nontraditional sources, and using effective and trusted partnerships between community and health care agencies with mutual respect. Community-academic partnerships can be a trusted conduit to discuss issues related to the health care of vulnerable populations."

Whether the provision has affected CRC and BC screening prevalence is unknown. The current study investigated whether CRC and BC screening prevalence among privately and Medicare-insured adults by socioeconomic status (SES) changed before and after the ACA. METHODS: Data obtained from the National Health Interview Survey pertaining to privately and Medicare-insured adults from 2008 (before the ACA) and 2013 (after the ACA) were used. There were 15,786 adults aged 50 to 75 years in the CRC screening analysis and 14,530 women aged ≥40 years in the BC screening analysis. Changes in guideline-recommended screening between 2008 and 2013 by SES were expressed as the prevalence difference (PD) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) adjusted for demographics, insurance, income, education, body mass index, and having a usual provider. RESULTS: Overall, CRC screening prevalence increased from 57.3% to 61.2% between 2008 and 2013 (P<.001). Adjusted CRC screening prevalence during the corresponding period increased in low-income (PD, 5.9; 95% CI, 1.8 to 10.2), least-educated (PD, 7.2; 95% CI, 0.9 to 13.5), and Medicare-insured (PD, 6.2; 95% CI, 1.7 to 10.7) individuals, but not in high-income, most-educated, and privately insured respondents. BC screening remained unchanged overall (70.5% in 2008 vs 70.2% in 2013) and in the low SES groups. CONCLUSIONS: Increases in CRC screening prevalence between 2008 and 2013 were confined to respondents with low SES.

In 2006, Massachusetts passed health care reform, which resulted in almost all residents having insurance. Also, almost all state-level public and subsidized insurance programs cover abortion and there are fewer restrictions on abortion in Massachusetts compared with other states. Methods: We explored low-income women's experiences accessing abortion in Massachusetts through 27 in-depth telephone interviews with a racially diverse sample of low-income women who obtained abortions. Interviews were digitally recorded, transcribed, coded, and analyzed thematically. Results: Most women described having access to timely, conveniently located, affordable, and highly acceptable abortion care. However, a sizable minority of women had difficulty enrolling in or staying on insurance, making abortion expensive. A small minority of women said their abortion care could be improved by increasing emotional support and privacy, and decreasing appointment times. Some limited data also suggest that young women and immigrant women face specific barriers to care. Conclusion: This study provides important, novel information about the need for state-level policies that support access to health insurance and comprehensive abortion coverage. Such policies, along with a well-functioning health care environment, help to ensure that low-income women have access to abortion. However, not all abortion access challenges have been resolved in Massachusetts.

Furthermore, CRNAs correlated more with vulnerable populations such as the Medicaid-eligible population, uninsured population, and the unemployed.

Although no one approach fully addresses the many challenges of rural cancer care, a number of promising strategies and interventions have been developed that transcend the issues associated with long travel distances. These include outreach clinics, virtual tumor boards, teleoncology and other telemedicine applications, workforce recruitment and retention initiatives, and provider and patient education programs.

Survey findings show that between 2009 and 2013, the percentage of centers exhibiting medium or high levels of medical home capability almost doubled, from 32 percent to 62 percent. The greatest improvement was reported in patient tracking and care management. Despite this increased capability, health centers reported diminished ability to coordinate care with providers outside of the practice, particularly specialists.

In critiquing de Lubac, some recent scholarship has presented an interpretation of Aquinas that is remarkably similar to the problems associated with the neo-Scholastic method. These approaches indicate that in order for late modern democratic states to achieve their connatural ends of justice and the common good, they must directly advert to revealed knowledge and Church teaching. This essay proposes an alternative correction to de Lubac that both maintains a distinction between nature and grace and facilitates a capacity for Christians to engage in a nuanced dialogue of affirmation and critique of the human goods sought by late modern political and legal institutions.

Unlike private insurance, Medicaid programs are designed to attract clinically and socioeconomically vulnerable patients, and allow limited enrollee cost sharing. This suggests that the Medicaid expansion authorized by the Affordable Care Act may attract an adversely selected population that poses unknown utilization, and hence, financial risks to its federal and state financers. In this study, I test for information asymmetry by examining whether unobserved determinants of Medicaid enrollment are correlated with unobserved determinants of emergency department and primary care visits, using the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. I use instrumental variables, correlation tests, and a simulation analysis to test for correlated unobservables. I find evidence of information asymmetry in Medicaid for emergency care use, but not primary care visits, once certain demographic and health variables are controlled. Since new Medicaid enrollees may not have “baseline” claims or diagnostic data, it may be helpful to collect information on their self-rated health status and disease history, such as obesity and heart attacks. Controlling for these variables may improve forecasts of health care use among Medicaid enrollees, and can reduce estimation bias in non-experimental studies of Medicaid. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York."

In the religious challenges to the Affordable Care Act's employer mandate, on the other hand, employers claim that their religious convictions forbid them from merely subsidizing insurance through which their employees might commit a wrong (for example, by using contraception). The understanding of complicity underpinning these challenges is vastly more expansive than the standard that legal doctrine or moral theory contemplates. Courts routinely reject claims of conscientious objection to taxes that fund military initiatives or to university fees that support abortion services. In Hobby Lobby, however, the Supreme Court took the corporate owners at their word: the mere fact that Hobby Lobby believed that it would be complicit, no matter how idiosyncratic its belief, sufficed to qualify it for an exemption. In this way, the Court made elements of an employee's healthcare package the ""boss's business"" (to borrow from the nickname of the Democrats' proposed bill to overturn Hobby Lobby). Much of the critical reaction to Hobby Lobby focuses on the issue of corporate rights of religious freedom. Yet this issue is a red herring. The deeper concerns that Hobby Lobby raises-about whether employers may now refuse, on religious grounds, to subsidize other forms of health coverage (for example, blood transfusions or vaccinations) or to serve customers whose lifestyles they deplore (for example, gays and lesbians)-do not turn on the organizational form that the employer has adopted. Instead, the more significant issue goes to our understanding of complicity: When is it reasonable for an employer (for-profit or nonprofit, corporate or individual) to think itself complicit in the conduct of its employees or customers? And when is a reasonable claim of complicity compelling enough to warrant an accommodation, especially when that accommodation would impose costs on third parties? Hobby Lobby does not provide the proper guidance for answering these questions, and no wonder: as I argue here, the concept of complicity pervading the treatment of conscientious objection in the law is murky and misleading, and it often yields unjust results. This Article offers the guidance that the doctrine does not. To that end, it exposes the flaws in the understandings of complicity evident in both the majority and dissenting opinions in Hobby Lobby, as well as in Religious Freedom Restoration Act cases more generally. It then seeks to disaggregate the elements of a complicity claim and to identify which of these elements deserves to be treated deferentially. Deference, however, is not decisive. The Article's second ambition is to expose an oversight in the law's treatment of conscientious objection-namely, its failure to inquire into how a religious accommodation will affect third parties. Exemption opponents contend that the law already requires courts to deny an accommodation when the accommodation would impose substantial burdens on third parties. I believe that these opponents have a mistaken and overly sanguine view of the protection that the doctrine currently affords. I end the Article by proposing a revised balancing test-one that reflects a far more nuanced grasp of what is at stake for the objector while yielding far more just outcomes for third parties. © 2015 by The University of Chicago."

Expert-generalists, a concept drawn from an extant Canadian model, would be a cohort of primary care physicians who obtain additional training in a subspecialty area, which would widen their practice portfolio and bring enhanced infrastructure to primary care settings. Expanding the reach of primary care into the realm of more advanced subspecialty practice could be a way to enhance both access to and quality of care in a cost-effective fashion, in part because the educational framework for additional training already exists. Trainees could opt for an extra year of training after traditional residency or return to training after years in practice. Properly trained, an expert-generalist would benefit both the quality of the patient experience and the bottom line by expertly triaging patients to determine who will truly benefit from specialty consultations, decreasing specialists' engagement with cases that do not require their higher-tier care. The author considers the merits of this proposal, as well as potential objections and implementation challenges. It is suggested that this model be adopted incrementally, using demonstration projects that could assess the impact of an expert-generalist initiative on the physician workforce and on patients' access to quality primary and specialty care.

AYA patients with cancer typically present with diseases that span the spectrum from 'paediatric' cancers (such as acute lymphoblastic leukaemia [ALL] and brain tumours) to 'adult' tumours (such as breast cancer and melanoma), as well as cancers that are largely unique to their age group (such as testicular cancer and bone tumours). Research indicates that outcomes of AYA patients with cancer are influenced not only by the treatment provided, but also by factors related to 'host' biology. In addition to the potential biological and cancer-specific differences between AYAs and other patients with cancer, AYA patients also often have disparate access to clinical trials and suffer from a lack of age-appropriate psychosocial support services and health services, which might influence survival as well as overall quality of life. In this Review, these issues are discussed, with a focus on two types of AYA cancer-ALL and melanoma-highlighting findings arising from the use of emerging technologies, such as whole-genome sequencing. © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited."

Study design: We conducted two national surveys, one in 2012 and one in 2015, collecting information about health insurance coverage and access to care from 8000 women aged 18-39. We examine type of insurance and continuity of coverage between time periods, including poverty status and whether or not women live in a state that expanded Medicaid coverage. Results: The proportion of women who were uninsured declined by almost 40% (from 19% to 12%), though several groups, including US-born and foreign-born Latinas, experienced no significant declines. Among low-income women in states that expanded Medicaid, the proportion uninsured declined from 38% to 15%, largely due to an increase in Medicaid coverage (from 40% to 62%). Declines in uninsurance in nonexpansion states were only marginally significant. Conclusions: Despite substantial improvements in health insurance coverage, significant gaps remain, particularly in states that have not expanded Medicaid and for Latinas. Implications: This analysis examines changes in insurance coverage that occurred after the Affordable Care Act was implemented. While coverage has improved for many populations, sizeable gaps in coverage remain for Latinas and women in states that did not expand Medicaid. © 2016 The Authors."

This issue brief compares products sold on and off the exchanges to gain insight into how the ACA's market reforms are functioning. Initial concerns that insurers might seek to enroll lower-risk customers outside the exchanges have not been realized. Instead, more-generous benefit plans, which appeal to people with health problems, constitute a greater portion of plans sold off-exchange than those sold on-exchange. Although insur­ers that sell mostly on the exchanges incur an additional fee, they still devote a greater portion of their premium dollars to medical care.

Currently, other minimally invasive sampling procedures such as ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration biopsy (US-FNAB) and image guided core needle biopsy (IG-CNB) have become the preferred sampling procedures for evaluation of breast lesions. However, changes in the medical economy and the current growing emphasis on cost containment in the era of the Affordable Care Act make it necessary to stimulate a renewed interest in the use of FNAB as the initial diagnostic sampling procedure. This study was designed to define the changing trend in the practice of tissue sampling during the last several years, and to assess the comparative effectiveness and appropriateness of the procedure of choice for breast cancer diagnosis. Methods After Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval, the computer database of the Pathology Department, University of Florida, College of Medicine-Jacksonville at UF Health was retrospectively searched to identify all breast biopsy pathology reports issued during the period of January 2004 to December 2011. The inclusion criteria were all women that underwent any of the following biopsy types: FNAB, US-FNAB, IG-CNB, and surgical biopsy (SB). Diagnostic procedures were identified using current procedural terminology (CPT) codes recorded on claims from the UF Health Jacksonville patient accounting application files. The data obtained was used to determine which technique has the best cost-effectiveness in the diagnosis of breast cancer. The outcome variable for this project was a positive breast cancer diagnosis resulting from these methodologies. The predictor variable was the biopsy type used for sampling. The rate of cancer detection for each procedure was also determined. Results Among the four groups of procedures compared, the lower cost was attributed to FNAB, followed by US-FNAB, and SB. IG-CNB was the most costly procedure, even more expensive than SB. The more costs associated with IG-CNB compared to SB is related to the expense involved in the use of localizing devices and also attempts to sample a lesion more than once. More importantly, cancer yield by FNAB was the highest among all the procedures under study. Conclusion This study confirms the comparative effectiveness of FNAB in the evaluation of patients with breast cancer and justifies serious endorsement of this procedure as the initial diagnostic sampling modality for its unique potential in rapid reporting and cost-saving.

It examines, first, the effect of financial incentives on wellness program participation, and second, it estimates the impact of wellness program participation on utilization of health care services and spending. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (PPACA) allows employers to provide financial incentives of as much as 30 percent of the total cost of coverage when tied to participation in a wellness program. Participation in health risk assessments (HRAs) increased by 50 percentage points among members of unions that bargained in the incentive, and increased 22 percentage points among non-union employees. Participation in the biometric screening program increased 55 percentage points when financial incentives were provided. Biometric screenings led to an average increase of 0.31 annual prescription drug fills, with related spending higher by $56 per member per year. Otherwise, no significant effects of participation in HRAs or biometric screenings on utilization of health care services and spending were found. The largest increase in medication utilization as a result of biometric screening was for statins, which are widely used to treat high cholesterol. This therapeutic class accounted for one-sixth of the overall increase in prescription drug utilization. Second were antidepressants, followed by ACE inhibitors (for hypertension), and thyroid hormones (for hypothyroidism). Biometric screening also led to significantly higher utilization of biologic response modifiers and immunosuppressants. These specialty medications are used to treat autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis, and are relatively expensive compared with non-specialty medications. The added spending associated with the combined increase in fills of 0.02 was $27 per member per year--about one-half of the overall increase in prescription drug spending from those who participated in biometric screenings."

Assessing whether this potential is realized requires valid monitoring data in several areas, including receipt of an annual preventive visit. The purpose of this study is to describe and compare preventive visit rates across national surveys for adolescents and young adults. Methods This study, conducted in 2014: (1) identified national surveys with past-year preventive visit measures; (2) compared survey features, including mode of administration, respondent, response rate, demographic profile (univariate analysis), preventive visit measure wording, and method of construction; and (3) compared preventive visit rates, including rates among sociodemographic subgroups (bivariate analyses). Results Four 2011 surveys were identified: National Health Interview Survey, National Survey of Children's Health (2011-2012), and Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) for adolescents, and MEPS and Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System for young adults. Surveys varied by most assessed features; demographic profiles were similar. Preventive visit rates varied significantly across adolescents (43%-81%) and young adults (26%-58%). The largest differences in visit rates were in comparisons of subjective assessments to a more detailed assessment coded from specific records of visits kept by respondents. Sociodemographic differences in visit rates were consistent across surveys. Conclusions Further research is needed to assess reasons for the different estimates of preventive visits across national surveys. Those who monitor trends in receipt of recommended care for adolescents and young adults should take survey differences into account.

Methods We observed young adults aged 19-30 years in Philadelphia from January to March 2014 as they shopped for health insurance on HealthCare.gov. Participants were then interviewed to elicit their perceived advantages and disadvantages of insurance and factors considered important for plan selection. A 1-month follow-up interview assessed participants' plan enrollment decisions and intended use of health insurance. Data were analyzed using qualitative methodology, and salience scores were calculated for free-listing responses. Results We enrolled 33 highly educated young adults; 27 completed the follow-up interview. The most salient advantages of health insurance for young adults were access to preventive or primary care (salience score.28) and peace of mind (.27). The most salient disadvantage was the financial strain of paying for health insurance (.72). Participants revealed poor health insurance literacy with 48% incorrectly defining deductible and 78% incorrectly defining coinsurance. The most salient factors reported to influence plan selection were deductible (.48) and premium (.45) amounts as well as preventive care (.21) coverage. The most common intended health insurance use was primary care. Eight participants enrolled in HealthCare.gov plans: six selected silver plans, and three qualified for tax credits.

With the advent of the Affordable Care Act, there is much speculation on the impact that health care coverage expansion will have on ED usage across the country. It is currently unclear what the effects of Medicaid expansion and a decreased number of uninsured patients will have on ED usage. Objective We sought to identify the motivators behind ED use in patients who were admitted to a university teaching hospital in order to project the possible impact of health care reform on ED utilization. Methods We surveyed a convenience sample of uninsured patients who presented to the ED and were subsequently admitted to the inpatient setting. Results Our respondents sought care in the ED primarily because they perceived their condition to be a medical emergency. Their lack of insurance and associated costs of care resulted in delays in seeking care, in reduced access, and a limited ability to manage chronic health conditions. Thus, contributing to their admission. Conclusions Affordability will reduce financial barriers to health care insurance coverage. However, efficient and timely access to primary care is a stronger determinant of ED usage in our sample. Health insurance coverage does not guarantee improved health care access.

CVD is understudied among Latinos, who have high levels of CVD risk factors. This study aimed to determine whether access to health care (ie, insurance status and having a usual source of care) is associated with 4 CVD prevention factors (ie, health care utilization, CVD screening, information received from health care providers, and lifestyle factors) among Latino adults and to evaluate whether the associations depended on CVD clinical risk/disease.Data were collected as part of a community-engaged food environment intervention study in East Los Angeles and Boyle Heights, CA. Logistic regressions were fitted with insurance status and usual source of care as predictors of the 4 CVD prevention factors while controlling for demographics. Analyses were repeated with interactions between self-reported CVD clinical risk/disease and access to care measures.Access to health care significantly increased the odds of CVD prevention. Having a usual source of care was associated with all factors of prevention, whereas being insured was only associated with some factors of prevention. CVD clinical risk/disease did not moderate any associations.Although efforts to reduce CVD risk among Latinos through the Affordable Care Act could be impactful, they might have limited impact in curbing CVD among Latinos, via the law's expansion of insurance coverage. CVD prevention efforts must expand beyond the provision of insurance to effectively lower CVD rates."

In response to growing evidence detailing the high prevalence of ADEs, particularly among vulnerable older adults, Congress requested that the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) convene a Federal Interagency Steering Committee to establish a National Action Plan to focus on ADE prevention. In August 2014, the Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion released the final version of the National Action Plan for Adverse Drug Event Prevention. The Action Plan directly supports the goals of the HHS Strategic Plan and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act by providing guidance on tracking and preventing ADEs, as well as describing evidence-based tools and resources to enhance medication safety. ADE Action Plan Content: The Federal Interagency Steering Committee focused the Action Plan on ADEs that are clinically significant, account for the greatest number of measurable harms as identified by using existing surveillance tools, and are largely preventable. As such, the decision was made to target three medication classes: anticoagulants, diabetes agents (insulin and oral hypoglycemic agents), and opioids. The Action Plan is organized around four key areas: surveillance; evidence-based prevention; payment, policy incentives, and oversight; and research opportunities to advance medication safety. Conclusion: One measure of the ADE Action Plan's success will be the wider dissemination of information and educational resources to providers and patients (or consumers) regarding the risks associated with medications.

Through the 2012 National Survey of Peer-Run Organizations, organizational directors reported their organization’s willingness to accept Medicaid reimbursement and knowledge about the ACA. Multinomial logistic regression was used to model the association between willingness to accept Medicaid and the primary predictor of knowledge of the ACA, as well as other predictors at the organizational and state levels. Knowledge of the ACA, Medicaid expansion, and discussions about healthcare reform were not significantly associated with willingness to be a Medicaid provider. Having fewer paid staff was associated with not being willing to be a Medicaid provider, suggesting that current staffing capacity is related to attitudes about becoming a Medicaid provider. Organizations had both ideological and practical concerns about Medicaid reimbursement. Concerns about Medicaid reimbursement can potentially be addressed through alternative financing mechanisms that should be able to meet the needs of peer-run organizations. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York"

We wanted to see if having access to primary care or insurance prior to diagnosis is associated with better outcomes for patients in an urban, public hospital with mostly socioeconomically disadvantaged Hispanic patients. Methods: We did a retrospective study at our institution. Kaplan Meier survival analysis was done looking at transplant-free overall survival for patients diagnosed at our institution. The log-rank test was done to compare survival between patients with and without prior access to primary care, and between patients with and without insurance at diagnosis. Results: Overall 5- and 10-year transplant-free overall survival was 91 % (95 % CI, 83-100 %) and 75 % (95 % CI, 50-99 %), respectively. Patients with primary care prior to diagnosis had significantly better transplant-free overall survival than those without (log rank test p = 0.019). Patients with primary care also had better clinical markers at diagnosis. Having insurance at diagnosis was not associated with better outcomes. Conclusions: Outcomes of autoimmune hepatitis are poor in our setting but access to primary care prior to diagnosis was associated with better outcomes. This is likely due to the important role that primary care plays in detecting disease and initiating treatment earlier. With the expansion of access to healthcare that the Affordable Care Act provides, future patients are likely to do better with even rare diseases like autoimmune hepatitis. © 2015 Kim et al."

We evaluated the early effects of these reforms on utilization of preventive services. Method: We analyzed nationally representative data on 15,044 Medicare seniors from the 2008-2010, and 2012 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, and examined self-reported cholesterol test, blood pressure check, flu vaccination, endoscopy, fecal occult blood test, prostate specific antigen test, breast examination, and mammography. Results: Enhanced Medicare benefits had no effects on preventive service utilization among Medicare seniors in 2012, including those with traditional Medicare and no other supplemental insurance, who stood to benefit the most from Part B enhancements. Conclusion: The muted overall response can be partly attributed to the fact that most seniors already held insurance that fully covered preventive services. While insurance enhancements can sometimes raise utilization, in the case of preventive services there are other fundamental barriers that require attention. Educating and incentivizing physicians about the need to refer/recommend screenings, and enhancing knowledge among seniors about the importance of preventive care are two steps that would likely go a long way towards increasing utilization. © 2015 Elsevier Inc."

Although the aging U.S. population and rising health care costs are expected to increase the share of gross domestic product devoted to Medicare, changes made in the program over the past decade have helped stabilize Medicare's financial outlook--even as benefits have been expanded. Long-term forecasting uncertainty should make policymakers and beneficiaries wary of dramatic changes to the program in the near term that are intended to alter its long-term forecast: the range of error associated with cost forecasts rises as the forecast window lengthens. Instead, policymakers should focus on the immediate policy window, taking steps to reduce the current burden of Medicare costs by containing spending today."

Health insurance provides protection against the possibility of financial loss due to high health care expenses. Also, people do not know ahead of time exactly what their health care expenses will be, so paying for health insurance on a regular basis helps ease their out-of-pocket spending. While health coverage continues to be mostly a private enterprise in this country, government plays an increasingly significant role. Government has initiated and responded to dynamics in medicine, the economy, and the workplace through legislation and public policies. One of the most recent efforts was enactment and ongoing implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA; P.L. 111-148, as amended). ACA includes provisions to encourage the expansion of health insurance coverage, and establish new federal health insurance standards, among other reforms. Americans obtain health insurance in different settings and through a variety of methods. In 2013, a majority (64.2%) of Americans obtained health insurance through the private sector, which includes both employer-sponsored and individual market coverage. Public programs (Medicare, Medicaid/CHIP, or health services for military service members and veterans) provided coverage to 34.3% of Americans. Approximately 13.4% of Americans were uninsured for the entire year of 2013. Health insurance benefits are delivered and financed under different systems. The factors that distinguish one delivery system from another are many, including how health care is financed, how much access to providers and services is controlled, and how much authority the enrollee has to design her/his health plan. To illustrate, managed care is characterized by predetermined restrictions on accessing services and providers, whereas individual decision-making regarding use of health benefits is a hallmark of consumer driven health care, such as health savings accounts. As economic conditions change, a specific delivery system may gain or lose the interest of affected parties. © 2015 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved."

For example, Members and staff were eligible to voluntarily enroll in employer-sponsored health insurance through the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP), and they could choose to participate in other health benefit programs, such as the Federal Flexible Spending Account Program (FSAFEDS). Section 1312(d)(3)(D) of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA; P.L. 111-148, as amended) generally specifies that the only health plans that the federal government may make available to Members and certain congressional staff (with respect to their service as Members or staff) are either created under ACA or offered through an exchange. A final rule issued by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) amends FEHBP eligibility regulations to comply with Section 1312(d)(3)(D) of ACA. Under the final rule, beginning January 1, 2014, Members and designated congressional staff are no longer able to purchase FEHBP plans as active employees; however, if they enroll in a health plan offered through a small business health options program (SHOP) exchange, they remain eligible for an employer contribution toward coverage. Additionally, the final rule allows Members and designated congressional staff who are eligible for retirement to enroll in a FEHBP plan upon retirement. This report summarizes the provisions of the final rule and describes how it affects current and retired Members and congressional staff. OPM has indicated that Members and congressional staff are still eligible for other health benefits related to federal employment, and these additional health benefits are outlined in this report. These health benefits include FSAFEDS, the Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program (FEDVIP), the Federal Long Term Care Insurance Program (FLTCIP), the Office of the Attending Physician, and treatment in military facilities. This report also discusses Members' and staff's eligibility for Medicare, which does not appear to be affected by the final rule. © 2015 Nova Science Publishers, Inc."

Since its creation, it has provided private health insurance coverage to federal employees, annuitants, and their dependents. It is the largest employer-sponsored health insurance program in the country, covering about 8 million enrollees each year. The program was created by the Federal Employees Health Benefits Act of 1959 (FEHBA, P.L. 86-382). FEHBA and its subsequent amendments established the parameters for eligibility and the election of coverage; the types of health plans and benefits that may be offered; the level of the government's share of premiums; the Employees Health Benefits Fund to pay for program expenses; and provisions for studies, reports, and audits. FEHBA also outlined the role of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). By law, OPM is given the authority to contract with insurers and to prescribe regulations to manage FEHBP, among other duties. The general model of FEHBP has not changed since its inception in 1959. FEHBP was and is a program that allows competing private insurers to offer numerous types of coverage to enrollees within broad federal guidelines. The federal government and the employee/annuitant have always shared the cost of the premium, and generally, employees and annuitants have always had access to the same plans at the same cost. However, specific features of FEHBP have been modified, in some cases multiple times, by statutory changes, administrative actions, and judicial decisions. For example, through legislation, Congress has modified the formula for determining the government's share of premiums, and both Congress and OPM have broadened the types of health benefits that FEHBP plans must provide. Additionally, a Supreme Court decision recently expanded FEHBP eligibility to include same-sex spouses of FEHBP enrollees and the children of same-sex marriages. Congressional policymakers share responsibility with OPM for the program's viability and sustainability. Congress has financial and administrative interest in the program, as the government pays for a share of FEHBP premiums and Congress has legislative authority to modify FEHBP. Congressional interest in FEHBP also extends to FEHBP's potential applicability as a model for other health care programs or as an avenue to provide coverage, such as extending aspects of FEHBP to Medicare, or using it as one of the models for the exchanges under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA, P.L. 111-148, as amended). The purpose of the report is to provide historical and background information that helps explain how FEHBP has evolved into the program it is today. This report focuses solely on changes made to FEHBP through legislative action. Policymakers may use this report to understand how Congress has interacted with FEHBP in the past, and to inform its future interactions with FEHBP. Specifically, the report includes short discussions of how Congress has effected and maintained policy changes to FEHBP by restricting the use of federal funds; changed the formula for determining the government's share of FEHBP premiums; expanded eligibility for the program; and implemented policies that affect the relationship between Medicare and FEHBP. The Appendix includes detailed summaries of selected laws or provisions of laws that have directly amended or otherwise changed FEHBP. © 2015 Nova Science Publishers, Inc."

This report provides a general overview of FEHB. It describes the structure of FEHB, including eligibility for the program and coverage options available to enrollees, as well as premiums, benefits and cost sharing, and general financing of FEHB. The report also describes the role of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in administering the program. Eligible individuals include federal employees, retirees, and their family members. As of calendar year 2014, Members of Congress and certain congressional staff are no longer eligible to enroll in plans offered under FEHB as employees but may be eligible to enroll in retirement. Coverage options available to eligible individuals include individual or family coverage in an approved health benefits plan. Beginning in calendar year 2016, individuals will have a third coverage option: self plus one coverage for themselves and one eligible family member. Generally, available health benefits plans fall into two broad categories: fee-for-service (FFS) or health maintenance organizations (HMOs). FFS plans tend to be available nationwide, and HMOs tend to be locally available. Premiums are shared between the federal government and the employee or retiree. Benefits and cost sharing vary among FEHB plans, but all plans must cover basic services such as hospital and physician care and may require cost sharing in the form of deductibles, co-payments, or coinsurance. FEHB financing includes government contributions to premiums, contingency reserves in the U.S. Treasury to offset unexpected increases in costs, and administrative expenses incurred by OPM. The report also discusses how FEHB interacts with the United States Postal Service (USPS) and with Medicare as well as the impact of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA; P.L. 111-148, as amended) on FEHB. Like most federal agencies, the USPS offers health insurance to its employees through FEHB. However, collective bargaining rights and prefunding obligations for retiree health costs make the USPS unique among federal agencies with regard to health benefits. Most federal employees or retirees aged 65 or older are automatically entitled to Medicare Part A (Hospital Insurance, or HI). They also may choose to enroll in Medicare Part B (Supplementary Medical Insurance, or SMI) and Part D (prescription drug coverage). For individuals covered under an FEHB plan, Medicare is the primary payer, meaning it pays for benefits first, and FEHB is the secondary payer. The ACA established new requirements for FEHB plans in some cases. In others, it had no meaningful effect. For example, the requirement to provide coverage to children up to the age of 26 on their parent's plan was a new requirement for plans, but many plans were already meeting the requirement not to deny coverage based on preexisting conditions. © 2015 Nova Science Publishers, Inc."

Using linked 2009 Current Population Survey/Social Security Administration records data we find that the 6QS captures 66.3% of those whom administrative records confirm are receiving disability-based Social Security benefits. Adding a work-activity question increases our capture rate to 89.3%. We find little difference in the distribution of conditions of those reporting only a 6QS-based disability and those only reporting a work activity-based disability. The four function-related questions do a relatively good job of capturing beneficiaries based on these conditions. But the work-activity question does a far better job of capturing beneficiaries than do the two activity-related questions. We conclude that the 6QS is fundamentally flawed and that any minimum standard for capturing the population with disabilities must include a work-activity question. © 2014 - IOS Press and the authors."

Methods: To determine changes in mammography screening and their associations with new practice recommendations and the Affordable Care Act, we examined patient-level data from 249,803 screening mammograms from January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2012 in a large community-based health system in the northwestern United States. Associations were determined by an intervention analysis of time-series data method. Results: Among women screened, 64% were age 50-74 years; 84% self-identified as white race; 62% had commercial insurance; and 70% were seen in facilities located in metropolitan areas. Practice recommendations were associated with decreased screening volumes among women age <40 (-37.4 mammograms/month; -39.4% change; P<0.001), 40-49 (-106.0 mammograms/month; -11.2% change; P<0.001), and 75 (-54.7 mammograms/month; -10.0% change; P<0.001), but not women age 50-74. Implementation of the Affordable Care Act was associated with increased screening among women age 50-74 (+184.3 mammograms/month; +7.2% change; P=0.001), but not women <40 or 75; increases for age 40-49 were of borderline statistical significance (+56.9 mammograms/month; +6% change; P=0.06). Practice recommendations were also associated with decreased screening for women with commercial insurance, while the Affordable Care Act was associated with increased screening for women with Medicare, Medicaid, or other noncommercial sources of payment. Conclusions: Mammography screening volumes in a large community health system decreased among women age <50 and 75 in association with new U.S. Preventive Services Task Force practice recommendations, while insurance coverage changes under the Affordable Care Act were associated with increased screening volumes among women age 50-74. © 2015 Nelson et al.

Initial reports from the program show that orthopaedic surgeons lead all physician specialties in total and average industry payments. However, before further discussion of these payments and their implications can take place, it remains to be seen whether these figures are a true reflection of the field of orthopaedic surgery in general, rather than the result of a few outlier physicians in the field. In addition, the nature and sources of these funds should be determined to better inform the national dialogue surrounding these payments. Questions/Purposes: We asked: (1) How do industry payments to orthopaedic surgeons compare with payments to physicians and surgeons in other fields, in terms of median payments and the Gini index of disparity? (2) How much do payments to the highest-receiving orthopaedic surgeons contribute to total payments? (3) What kind of industry payments are orthopaedic surgeons receiving? (4) How much do the highest-paying manufacturers contribute to total payments to orthopaedic surgeons? Materials and Methods: We reviewed the most recent version of the CMS Sunshine Act Open Payments database released on December 19, 2014, containing data on payments made between August 1, 2013 and December 31, 2013. Data on total payments to individual physicians, physician specialty, the types of payments made, and the manufacturers making payments were reviewed. The Gini index of statistical dispersion was calculated for payments made to orthopaedic surgeons and compared with payments made to physicians and surgeons in all other medical specialties. A Gini index of 0 indicates complete equality of payments to everyone in the population, whereas an index of 1 indicates complete inequality, or all income going to one individual. Results: A total of 15,376 orthopaedic surgeons receiving payments during the 5-month period were identified, accounting for USD 109,846,482. The median payment to orthopaedic surgeons receiving payments was USD 121 (interquartile range, USD 34–619). The top 10% of orthopaedic surgeons receiving payments (1538 surgeons) received at least USD 4160 and accounted for 95% of total payments. Royalties and patent licenses accounted for 69% of all industry payments to orthopaedic surgeons. Conclusions: Even as a relatively small specialty, orthopaedic surgeons received substantial payments from industry (more than USD 110 million) during the 5-month study period. Whether there is a true return of value from these payments remains to be seen; however, future ethical and policy discussions regarding industry payments to orthopaedic surgeons should take into account the large disparities in payments that are present and also the nature of the payments being made. It is possible that patients and policymakers may view industry payments to orthopaedic surgeons more positively in light of these new findings.

In addition, many women experienced transitions in coverage around the time of pregnancy. Having no health insurance coverage or experiencing gaps or shifts in coverage can be a barrier to receiving preventive health services and treatment for health problems that could affect pregnancy and newborn health. With the passage of ACA, women who were previously uninsured or had insurance that provided inadequate coverage might have better access to health services and better coverage, including additional preventive services with no cost sharing. Because certain elements of ACA (e.g., no lifetime dollar limits, dependent coverage to age 26, and provision of preventive services without cost sharing) were implemented as early as September 2010, data from 2009 can be used as a baseline to measure the incremental impact of ACA on the continuity of health care coverage for women around the time of pregnancy.2009.DESCRIPTION OF SYSTEM: The Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) is an ongoing state- and population-based surveillance system designed to monitor selected maternal behaviors and experiences that occur before, during, and shortly after pregnancy among women who deliver live-born infants in selected U.S. states and New York City, New York. PRAMS uses mixed-mode data collection, in which up to three self-administered surveys are mailed to a sample of mothers, and those who do not respond are contacted for telephone interviews. Self-reported survey data are linked to birth certificate data and weighted for sample design, nonresponse, and noncoverage. Annual PRAMS data sets are created and used to produce statewide estimates of preconception and perinatal health behaviors and experiences in selected states and New York City. This report summarizes data from 29 states that conducted PRAMS in 2009, before the passage of ACA, and achieved an overall weighted response rate of ≥65%. Data on the prevalence of health insurance coverage stability (stable coverage, unstable coverage, and uninsured) across three time periods (the month before pregnancy, during pregnancy, and at the time of delivery) are reported by state and selected maternal characteristics. Women with stable coverage had the same type of health insurance (private or Medicaid) for all three time periods. Women with unstable coverage experienced a change in health insurance coverage between any of the three time periods. This includes movement from having no insurance coverage to gaining coverage, movement from one type of coverage to another, and loss of coverage. Women in the uninsured group had no insurance coverage during any of the three time periods. Estimates for health insurance stability across the three time periods and estimates of coverage during each time period are presented by state. Patterns of movement between the different types of health insurance coverage among women with unstable coverage are described by state and selected maternal characteristics.RESULTS: In 2009, 30.1% of women who had a live birth experienced changes in health insurance coverage in the period between the month before pregnancy and the time of delivery, either because they lacked coverage at some point or because they moved between different types of coverage. Most women had stable coverage across the three time periods, reporting either private coverage (52.8%) or Medicaid coverage (16.1%) throughout. A small percentage of women (1.1%) reported having no health insurance coverage at any point. Overall, Medicaid coverage increased from 16.6% in the month before pregnancy to 43.9% at delivery. Private coverage decreased from 59.9% in the month before pregnancy to 54.6% at delivery. The percentage of women who were uninsured decreased from 23.4% in the month before pregnancy to 1.5% at the time of delivery. Among those who experienced changes in coverage, 74.4% reported having no insurance the month before pregnancy, 23.9% reported having private insurance, and 1.8% reported having Medicaid. Among those who started out uninsured before pregnancy, 70.2% reported Medicaid coverage, and 4.1% reported private coverage at the time of delivery. Among those who started out with private coverage, 21.3% reported Medicaid coverage at delivery, and 1.4% reported being uninsured. As a result of these transitions in health insurance coverage, 92.4% of all women who experienced a change in health insurance around the time of pregnancy reported Medicaid coverage at delivery. No women with unstable coverage who started out without insurance in the month before pregnancy reported being uninsured at the time of delivery. Women who reported unstable coverage were more likely to be young (aged <35 years), be a minority (black, Hispanic, or American Indian/Alaska Native), have a high school education or less, be unmarried, have incomes ≤200% of the federal poverty level (FPL), or have an unintended pregnancy compared with women with stable private coverage. Compared with women with stable Medicaid coverage, women with unstable coverage were more likely to be Hispanic but less likely to be teenagers (aged ≤19 years), be black, have a high school education or less, have incomes ≤200% of the FPL, or have an unintended pregnancy. Women with unstable coverage were more likely than women in either stable coverage group (private or Medicaid) to report entering prenatal care after the first trimester.INTERPRETATION: In 2009, nearly one third of women reported lacking health insurance or transitioning between types of health insurance coverage around the time of pregnancy. The majority of women who changed health insurance status obtained coverage for prenatal care, delivery, or both through Medicaid. Health insurance coverage during pregnancy can help facilitate access to health care and allow for the identification and treatment of health-related issues; however, prenatal coverage might be too late to prevent the consequences of preexisting conditions and preconception exposures that could affect maternal and infant health. Continuous access to health insurance and health care for women of reproductive age could improve maternal and infant health by providing the opportunity to manage or treat conditions that are present before and between pregnancies.PUBLIC HEALTH ACTION: PRAMS data can be used to identify patterns of health insurance coverage among women around the time of pregnancy. Removing barriers to obtaining health insurance for women who lack coverage, particularly before pregnancy, could improve the health of women and their infants. The findings in this report can be used by public health professionals, policy analysts, and others to monitor health insurance coverage for women around the time of pregnancy. In particular, 2009 state-specific data can serve as baseline information to assess and monitor changes in health insurance coverage since the passage of ACA."

We examined national trends in survival disparities for AYAs with NHL by race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status (SES, county-level poverty) to further understand NHL and to begin monitoring health outcome disparities for this disease. Methods: Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results data were used to calculate 5-year relative survival rates of AYAs diagnosed with NHL from 1992 to 2007 and followed through 2011. Absolute and relative disparities were computed using HD*Calc. Whether a significant linear trend was present was evaluated using Joinpoint. Analyses were replicated after excluding individuals with known HIV infection. Results: The study sample included 9,573 total and 7,121 non-HIV cases of NHL. Five-year survival rates improved for all groups over time. Significant decreases were found in absolute disparities for race/ethnicity (non-HIV), in relative disparities for SES (total) and race/ethnicity (total and non-HIV) (all p < 0.05). Survival rates of non-Hispanic Blacks and Hispanics remained below than those of non-Hispanic Whites throughout the time period. Conclusion: Absolute and relative disparities in 5-year survival narrowed for AYAs with NHL over the time period. To continue to promote this trend, future research should investigate factors, particularly diagnostic delays and barriers to care, which continue to contribute to SES and racial/ethnic differences in survival. These factors may be particularly relevant to identify given the recent Affordable Care Act, which is designed to increase access to medical services, particularly for young adults. © 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland (outside the USA)."

OBJECTIVE: To examine qualities of a usual provider that align with PCMH goals of access, comprehensiveness, and patient-centered care, and to determine whether PCMH qualities in a usual provider are associated with the use of mental health services (MHS). DESIGN: Using national data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, we conducted a lagged cross-sectional study of MHS use subsequent to participant reports of psychological distress and usual provider and practice characteristics. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 2,358 adults, aged 18–64 years, met the criteria for serious psychological distress and reported on their usual provider and practice characteristics. MAIN MEASURES: We defined “usual provider” as a primary care provider/practice, and “PCMH provider” as a usual provider that delivered accessible, comprehensive, patient-centered care as determined by patient self-reporting. The dependent variable, MHS, included self-reported mental health visits to a primary care provider or mental health specialist, counseling, and psychiatric medication treatment over a period of 1 year. RESULTS: Participants with a usual provider were significantly more likely than those with no usual provider to have experienced a primary care mental health visit (marginal effect [ME] = 8.5, 95 % CI = 3.2–13.8) and to have received psychiatric medication (ME = 15.5, 95 % CI = 9.4–21.5). Participants with a PCMH were additionally more likely than those with no usual provider to visit a mental health specialist (ME = 7.6, 95 % CI = 0.7–14.4) and receive mental health counseling (ME = 8.5, 95 % CI = 1.5–15.6). Among those who reported having had any type of mental health visit, participants with a PCMH were more likely to have received mental health counseling than those with only a usual provider (ME = 10.0, 95 % CI = 1.0–19.0). CONCLUSIONS: Access to a usual provider is associated with increased receipt of needed MHS.

This article overviews an action research and teaching project developed at an undergraduate liberal arts university and focused on providing ACA enrollment assistance as a way to support student engagement with community health. The project was oriented around education, enrollment and evaluation activities in the community, and students and faculty together reflected on and analyzed the experiences that came from the research and outreach project. Student learning centered around applying concepts of diversity and political agency to health policy and community health systems. Students reported and faculty observed an unexpected empowerment for students who were able to use their university-learned critical thinking skills to explain complex systems to a wide range of audiences. In addition, because the project was centered at a university with no health professions programs, the project provided students interested in community and public health with the opportunity to reflect on how health and access to health care is conditioned by social context. The structure and pedagogical approaches and implications of the action research and teaching project is presented here as a case study for how to engage undergraduates in questions of community and public health through the lens of health policy and community engagement. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York."

More than half of adults who currently have coverage either through the Affordable Care Act's (ACA's) marketplace plans or Medicaid expansion were uninsured prior to gaining coverage. Of those, more than 60 percent lacked coverage for one year or longer. More than six of 10 adults who used their new plans to obtain care reported they could not have afforded or accessed it previously. Majorities of people with ACA coverage who have used their plans express satisfaction with the doctors covered in their networks and are able to find physicians with relative ease. Wait times to get appointments with physicians in marketplace plans and Medicaid are comparable to those reported by other working-age adults."

Instead, they competed mainly by screening and selecting people based on their risk of incurring high medical costs. One of the ACA's goals is to encourage carriers to participate in the health insurance marketplaces and to shift the focus from competing based on risk selection to processes that increase consumer value, like improving efficiency of services and quality of care. Focusing on six states--Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Maryland, Montana, and Texas--this brief looks at how carriers are competing in the new marketplaces, namely through cost-sharing and composition of provider networks."

While many major global health initiatives have followed this trend, so have many smaller scale programs including short-term medical brigades. Despite a trending increase in the number of privately run short-term medical brigades, until recently, little research has been done on the potential positive and negative effects that can arise from such programs. Now, guidelines have been initiated to create well-structured programs. When followed, these smaller scale initiatives can be successful in helping increase access to healthcare, sustainably strengthening communities in terms of general health.

This created an opportunity to examine the impact of Medicaid expansion on the number of Medicaid patients with newly identified diabetes among enrollees (19-64 years of age) who had laboratory testing through Quest Diagnostics. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Newly identified diabetes was defined as an ICD-9 diagnosis code of 250.x (diabetes) or hemoglobin A1c of &gt;6.4% (46 mmol/mol) within the first 6 months of a calendar year and the absence of both in the preceding calendar year within our data repository. RESULTS: We identified 215,398 and 218,890 patients who met our definition of newly diagnosed diabetes within the first 6 months of 2013 (control period) and 2014 (study period), respectively (a 1.6% increase). We identified 26,237 Medicaid-enrolled patients with new diabetes in the control period vs. 29,673 in the study period: an increase of 13%. The number of Medicaid-enrolled patients with newly identified diabetes increased by 23% (14,625 vs. 18,020 patients) in the 26 states (and District of Columbia) that expanded Medicaid compared with an increase of 0.4% (11,612 vs. 11,653 patients) in the 24 states that did not expand Medicaid during this period. Similar differences were observed in younger and older adults and for both men and women.

The implementation of a practice model designed to reduce hospital readmissions through optimal deployment of pharmacy staff on multidisciplinary care collaboration teams is described. Summary. In response to Affordable Care Act provisions aimed at reducing preventable hospital readmissions, the pharmacy department at The Johns Hopkins Hospital (JHH) led the implementation of a new pharmacy services model spanning both inpatient and outpatient settings. Key components of the model include (1) increased pharmacist participation in multidisciplinary rounds, (2) targeted medication reconciliation and patient education, (3) postdischarge phone monitoring of selected patients, and (4) bedside discharge medication delivery performed by a ""transitions pharmacist extender."" Incorporation of care coordination activities into the daily workflow has increased the rate of patient education on high-risk medications and allowed for affordable and effective medication regimens to be designed and prescriptions to be filled prior to patient discharge. The ultimate goal is enhanced multidisciplinary collaboration to decrease hospital readmissions by increasing medication adherence and patients' understanding of medications. Conclusion. The inpatient and outpatient pharmacy teams at JHH collaborated to improve their understanding of patients' medication use prior to admission through targeted medication reconciliation, education of patients on high-risk medications initiated during admission, and development of affordable and practical medication regimens that patients would receive in hand on discharge.

Uniform caps led to a small reduction in percentage of individuals experiencing financial burden (from 3.3 % to 3.1 %), with a modestly larger reduction as a result of reduced uniform caps (2.9 %) and income-based caps (2.8 %).BACKGROUND: The Affordable Care Act (ACA) mandates that all private health insurance include out-of-pocket spending caps. Insurance purchased through the ACA’s Health Insurance Marketplace may qualify for income-based caps, whereas group insurance will not have income-based caps. Little is known about how out-of-pocket caps impact individuals’ health care financial burden. © 2014, Society of General Internal Medicine."

However, individuals may forgo obtaining preventive care when they are busy with competing activities and commitments. This study examined whether time pressure related to work obligations creates barriers to obtaining needed preventive health services. Methods: Data from the 2002-2010 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) were used to measure the work hours of 61,034 employees (including 27,910 females) and their use of five preventive health services (flu vaccinations, routine check-ups, dental check-ups, mammograms and Pap smear). Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to test the association between working hours and use of each of those five services. Results: Individuals working long hours (>. 60 per week) were significantly less likely to obtain dental check-ups (OR. = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.72-0.91) and mammograms (OR. = 0.47, 95% CI: 0.31-0.73). Working 51-60. h weekly was associated with less likelihood of receiving Pap smear (OR. = 0.67, 95% CI: 0.46-0.96). No association was found for flu vaccination. Conclusions: Time pressure from work might create barriers for people to receive particular preventive health services, such as breast cancer screening, cervical cancer screening and dental check-ups. Health practitioners should be aware of this particular source of barriers to care. © 2015 Elsevier Inc."

Through critical discourse analysis, I argue that the BZP does reflect a neoliberalization of public health, but as an ""actually existing neoliberalism"" it emerges from a specific policy context, including dramatic health sector policy changes due to the national Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare; a media discourse of health crisis for an aging Midwestern population; and an effort to refashion Iowa cities as sites of healthy and active living, to retain and attract a creative class of young entrepreneurs. The BZP employs many well-known mechanisms of neoliberal governance: the public-private partnership; competition among communities for ""public"" funds; promotion of an apolitical discourse on individual responsibility and ownership of health; decentralizing governance to the ""community"" level; and marketing, branding, and corporate sponsorship of public projects. The BZP exemplifies the process of ""neoliberal governmentality,"" by which individuals learn to govern themselves and their ""life projects"" in line with a market-based rationality. However, with its emphasis on ""nudging"" individuals towards healthy behaviors through small changes in the local environment, the BZP reflects the rise of ""libertarian paternalism,"" a variant of neoliberalism, as a dominant ideology underlying contemporary health promotion efforts. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd."

However, most models on implementation only target clinicians or health systems as the adopters of evidence. Patients are largely ignored in these models. A new implementation model that captures the complex but important role of patients in the uptake of evidence may be a critical missing link. Discussion: Through a process of theory evaluation and development, we explore patient-centered concepts (patient activation and shared decision making) within an implementation model by mapping qualitative data from an elective induction of labor study to assess the model's ability to capture these key concepts. The process demonstrated that a new, patient-centered model for implementation is needed. In response, the Evidence Informed Decision Making through Engagement Model is presented. We conclude that, by fully integrating women into an implementation model, outcomes that are important to both the clinician and patient will improve. Conclusions: In the interest of providing evidence-based care to women during pregnancy and childbirth, it is essential that care is patient centered. The inclusion of concepts discussed in this article has the potential to extend beyond maternity care and influence other clinical areas. Utilizing the newly developed Evidence Informed Decision Making through Engagement Model provides a framework for utilizing evidence and translating it into practice while acknowledging the important role that women have in the process. © 2015."

As more individuals obtain health insurance coverage with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the number seeking care will increase dramatically. Both the Institute of Medicine and the American College of Nurse-Midwives state that certified nurse-midwives and certified midwives should function at their full scope of practice, which includes primary care services as delineated by the Core Competencies for Basic Midwifery Practice. Nonetheless, the percentage of midwives who self-identify as primary care providers is decreasing. Dedicated primary care educational experiences may increase student confidence and encourage the incorporation of primary care into midwifery practice after graduation. Methods: Midwifery students in 2 cohorts completed questionnaires before and after a dedicated primary care practicum to study changes in the perceived level of confidence in primary care provision. The students in cohort A participated in 45 hours of primary care clinical time, whereas the students in cohort B participated in 88 hours of primary care clinical time. Postclinical focus groups provided qualitative data on student perceptions and attitudes about the clinical experience. Student responses were coded by cohort and analyzed using qualitative descriptive analysis. Results: Seventeen midwifery students from 2 cohorts completed questionnaires. Students in both cohorts reported increased perceived confidence in almost all primary care domains. Discussion: Participation in a dedicated primary care clinical rotation increased student-perceived confidence in primary care practice. The inclusion of designated primary care clinical education in nurse-midwifery education may contribute to meeting the national need for primary care providers.

This policy brief assesses the changes in HIMs from 2014 to 2015 in terms of choices offered and premiums charged, with emphasis on how these measures vary across rural and urban places. Key Findings. (1) In 74 percent of HIM rating areas, the number of firms operating increased by at least one, while the number of firms decreased in only about 6 percent of rating areas. Further, 64 percent of rating areas with fewer than 50 persons per square mile gained at least one firm. (2) There was no consistent pattern of premium increases with respect to rating area population density (used as a proxy here for the degree of ""ruralness"" of the rating areas). Nationally, rural areas are not experiencing higher premium increases than their urban counterparts. In fact, the lowest increases in second-lowest cost silver plan premiums occurred in the medium-density population rating areas of 51 to 300 persons per square mile. (3) Average adjusted premiums increased from 2014 to 2015 by 6.7 percent in Federally-Facilitated Marketplaces (FFMs) compared to just 1.4 percent in State-Based Marketplaces (SBMs). Regardless of SBM or FFM status, premium increases across the United States were negatively correlated with the number of firms entering the market. (4) Analysis of the most rural states, in terms of percentage of the population classified as nonmetropolitan, shows that, in general, premiums fell significantly in rural places where they had been rather high, and they increased in rural places where they had been rather low. The five rural states with the lowest premium increases had an average of 0.17 firms entering the market, while the five with the highest premium increases had an average of 0.50 firms exiting the market."

Little is known about use of these pharmacotherapies among Medicaid-enrolled women. Purpose To describe the prevalence of prescription fills for smoking-cessation pharmacotherapies during pregnancy and postpartum among Medicaid-enrolled women and to examine whether certain pregnancy complications or copayments are associated with prescription fills. Methods Insurance claims data for women enrolled in a Medicaid managed care plan in Maryland and who used tobacco during pregnancy from 2003 to 2010 were obtained (N=4,709) and analyzed in 2014. Descriptive statistics were used to calculate the prevalence of smoking-cessation pharmacotherapy use during pregnancy and postpartum. Generalized estimating equations were employed to examine the relationship of pregnancy complications and copayments with prescription fills of smoking-cessation pharmacotherapies during pregnancy and postpartum. Results Few women filled any prescription for a smoking-cessation pharmacotherapy during pregnancy or postpartum (2.6% and 2.0%, respectively). Having any smoking-related pregnancy complication was positively associated with filling a smoking-cessation pharmacotherapy prescription during pregnancy (OR=1.69, 95% CI=1.08, 2.65) but not postpartum. Copayments were associated with significantly decreased odds of filling any prescription for smoking-cessation pharmacotherapies in the postpartum period (OR=0.38, 95% CI=0.22, 0.66). Conclusions Smoking-related pregnancy complications and substance use are predictive of filling a prescription for pharmacotherapies for smoking cessation during pregnancy. Low use of pharmacotherapies during pregnancy is consistent with clinical guidelines; however, low use postpartum suggests an unmet need for cessation aids in Medicaid populations. © 2015 American Journal of Preventive Medicine."

Section 3022 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 created the Medicare Shared Savings Program (SSP). The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) implements this program and has approved SSP contracts in five cycles since 2011, including some that participated in a special demonstration project that provided advance payment (as a forgivable loan). A new ACO Investment Model (AIM) program starts in 2015 that provides initial investment capital and variable monthly payments to ACO participants in rural and underserved areas who may not have access to the capital needed for successful ACO formation and operation. CMS also contracted with 32 organizations under a special demonstration project, ""Pioneer ACOs"" (as of November 16, 2014, there were 19 remaining).8 At the time of the research reported in this brief, there were 455 Medicare ACOs (Pioneer and SSP). While there is growing literature about ACOs, much remains to be learned about ACO development in rural areas. A previous RUPRI Center policy brief 2 examined the formation of four rural ACOs. The authors found that prior experience with risk sharing and provider integration facilitated ACO formation. This brief expands on the earlier brief by describing the findings of a survey of 27 rural ACOs, focusing on characteristics important to their formation and operation. Prospective rural ACO participants can draw from the experiences of predecessors, and the survey findings can inform policy discussions about ACO formation and operation. Key Findings from 27 Respondents. (1) Sixteen rural ACOs were formed by pre-existing integrated delivery networks. (2) Physician groups played a more prominent role than other participant types (including solo-practice physicians) in the formation and management of these rural ACOs. (3) Thirteen rural ACOs included hospitals with quality-based payment experience, and 11 rural ACOs included hospitals with risk-sharing experience. Twelve rural ACOs included physician groups with both quality-based payment and risk-sharing experience. (4) Managing care across the continuum and meeting quality standards were most frequently considered by respondents to be ""very important"" to the success of rural ACOs."

To recommend uses of these data sources. To demonstrate the application of these data sources in the public health field, using the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program as an example. Methods: We describe U.S. Census Bureau data sources for identifying low-income, uninsured populations using two population surveys: the Annual Social and Economic Supplement to the Current Population Survey (CPS ASEC) and the American Community Survey (ACS), and using one model-based estimation program, the Small Area Health Insurance Estimates (SAHIE). We provide recommendations for use of these data sources, and we use CPS ASEC and SAHIE to estimate the percent of U.S. women eligible for the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program (NBCCEDP). Results: CPS ASEC, ACS, and SAHIE are produced by the U.S. Census Bureau, and they are reliable sources for estimates of the low-income, uninsured populations in the USA. Key characteristics of these three data sources were presented to highlight the strengths of each to meet the needs of various programs at national and local levels. Recommendations are made on the use of the data sources. Based on these three data sources, estimates of NBCCEDP eligibility showed substantial variation over time at the national and state levels, and across states and counties. Conclusions: Publicly funded programs that are directed toward low-income, uninsured individuals require information on their eligible populations to make decisions about program policy and resource allocation, and to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of the programs. The U.S. Census Bureau produces three data sources (CPS ASEC, ACS, and SAHIE) for these estimates. The percent of U.S. women eligible for NBCCEDP varies over time and across states and counties.

This study explores this national conundrum from the physicians’ perspective. The impact of practice characteristics, compensation and performance measures are examined on physicians’ propensity to accept new Medicaid patients. This study draws upon data from the 2008 Health Tracking Physician Survey restricted-use file and is the first to provide for a comprehensive look at the determinants of physician acceptance. The approach is rooted in the economic theory of control, agency theory. The most significant factors found to be associated with diminished physician propensity for Medicaid access include: no present participation, having an ownership interest in the practice, operating as a one- or two-physician sized practice, operating as a primary care physician, low relative geographic physician reimbursement, lacking supportive clinical information technology and gender.

Therefore, following the ACA’s coverage expansion, many newly-insured older enrollees will face a complex insurance transition on their 65th birthday: they will lose Medicaid coverage and transition from Medicaid to Medicare as their primary insurer. This transition in primary health insurance coverage includes changes to benefits, patient cost-sharing, and provider reimbursement, which could have profound consequences on the use of health services and associated health outcomes for low-income seniors. Using data from 2012, we estimate that 1.6 million current Medicaid beneficiaries and an additional 1.6 to 2.9 million low-income individuals who will gain Medicaid coverage under the ACA will be likely to make this transition in the next decade. Primary care physicians and policymakers can help mitigate the potential consequences of this insurance transition by preparing patients for Medicare’s more restrictive insurance coverage, encouraging patients to sign up for available low-income subsidies, and understanding how the loss of Medicaid coverage impacts out-of-pocket costs. © 2015, Society of General Internal Medicine."

The purpose of this policy analysis is to outline key provisions in the Affordable Care Act (ACA) that incorporate health literacy approaches for implementation and have implications for CSHCN in the USA. Several key provisions are incorporated in the ACA that involve health literacy and have implications for CSHCN. These include: expansion of public insurance coverage and simplifying the enrollment process, provisions assuring equity in health care and communication among all populations, improving access to patient-centered medical homes that can offer care coordination, ensuring enhanced medication safety by changing liquid medication labeling requirements, and provisions to train health care providers on literacy issues.

This can only be accomplished when teaching hospitals critically examine their strengths, weaknesses, and core missions. GME needs to be better harmonized and integrated into the overall education of the physician to overcome the current compartmentalized configuration of medical training.

Our goal was to analyze the effects of policy legacy, institutional fragmentation, and public sentiments on state obstruction of the reform. Methods We gathered quantitative and qualitative evidence to generate cross-case comparisons of state implementation of 3 reform streams within the ACA: health insurance exchanges, Medicaid expansion, and regulatory reform. Our sources included secondary literature, analysis of official decisions, and background interviews with experts and public officials. Findings We found that state-level opponents of the ACA were most likely to be successful in challenging reforms with few preexisting policy legacies, high institutional fragmentation, and negative public sentiments. Reforms that built on existing state legislation, avoided state veto points or offered lucrative fiscal incentives, and elicited less negative public reaction were less likely to be contested. Implications Our findings point to the importance of institutional design for the role of political stakeholders in implementing reforms to improve the cost, quality, and availability of medical treatments. Although other research has found that political polarization has shaped early ACA outcomes, comparative analysis suggests political stakeholders have had the highest effect on reforms that were particularly vulnerable. © 2015 Elsevier HS Journals, Inc."

After securing substantial cuts to a program the President described as a failure, the Obama administration was compelled to take unprecedented administrative steps to put billions of dollars back into Medicare Advantage. These developments demonstrate how Medicare Advantage's support constituency, which has come to include Democrats, Republicans, beneficiaries, and the managed care industry, has maintained more political influence in the aftermath of the ACA than some initially believed. The continued and growing influence of the Medicare Advantage constituency does not, however, mean that Medicare is primed for a more conservative turn toward vouchers or premium support. With the provision of generous benefits and increasing evidence that Medicare Advantage produces higher quality health outcomes than traditional Medicare, Medicare Advantage appears to be secure in its current form."

The Obama administration and Congressional Democrats, though, had reason to expect that the ACA's political fortunes would substantially improve as the acrimonious debate over its enactment faded and millions of Americans came to receive significant benefits from health care reform. But 5 years after its passage, the ACA's political foundations remain shaky. We suggest that one reason for the ACA's unsettled fate is the role of policy feedbacks that undermine public support for and opponents' acceptance of the program. The ACA experience highlights how policy feedbacks can vary widely in their political impact, and suggests that some policies are in fact self-undermining. We also emphasize the crucial role of partisan polarization as a mediating factor in shaping policy feedbacks."

We evaluated the implications of ACA on the drug industry by examining the impact on the ""Dinner-for-Three"" dynamic in our health care system. We can think of our system as an odd dinner party in which one person pays (the insurer), one orders the meal (the physician), and yet another eats the meal (the patient). This dynamic requires us to examine each stakeholder and how they interact with one another to assess the impact of the ACA. Of the 6.7 million initial exchange enrollees, ~3.8 million subjects were previously uninsured. A higher percentage of these enrollees are using their pharmacy benefit, and they are disproportionately filling prescriptions for specialty drugs relative to those covered in employer-sponsored plans. Formulary designs in exchange plans are passing on higher cost-sharing for prescription drugs to the patient. ACA has also resulted in the development of accountable care organizations (ACOs); these organizations may play a role going forward in the management of drug spending and the development of formularies and protocols that impact drug prescribing. Payers are tightening control over drug spending and are finding physicians and physician groups increasingly less reluctant allies in doing so. Patients are faced by more complexity than ever in the health care system and are expected to take a more active role in responsibly managing the cost of their care. It is increasingly critical that drug manufacturers develop robust value propositions and communicate that value to all stakeholders. They should re-evaluate trial investment decisions and consider changes in price setting, rebates (how much and to whom), copay programs, and physician and patient support programs in light of changing market needs. © 2015 The Authors.

Objective To examine national trends in disparities in access to health care and to identify the impact of physical disability and the personal factors that are associated with unmet health care needs, defined as self-reported ability to get medical care, dental care or prescription medications, among working age adults within the United States. Methods Logistic regression analysis of a nationally representative sample of adults ages 25-64 (n = 163,220) with and without physical disabilities, using pooled data from the 2002-2011 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. Results Individuals with physical disabilities have 75% (p < 0.0001), 57% (p < 0.0001), and 85% (p < 0.000) higher odds of having unmet medical, dental, and prescription medication needs, respectively. Sociodemographic and health factors were related to unmet needs in all three measures of access to care. In particular, being female, living at or near the poverty level, and lacking health insurance increased the odds of unmet health care needs. Predicted probabilities of unmet health care needs from 2002 to 2011 show persistent gaps between individuals with and without physical disabilities, with a growing gap in unmet dental care (p = 0.004). Conclusion Having physical disabilities increase the odds of unmet health care needs. This study has important policy and community program implications. The Affordable Care Act could significantly reduce unmet health care needs, especially among individuals with physical disabilities. © 2015 Elsevier Inc."

Health outcomes have been related to expenditures to determine the utility and efficiency of medical practice. The scope and priorities of health outcomes have evolved significantly from traditional survival parameters. Emphasis is now given to quality of life (QOL), with functional outcomes and the avoidance or relief of distress and physical suffering now considered as important as overall survival. An improvement in overall survival, without also maintaining or improving QOL, is no longer considered a meaningful use of limited and expensive healthcare resources. The American Recovery and Reimbursement Act (ARRA; the ""Stimulus Act"") of 2009 that created the high-funded Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) codified this change in healthcare outcomes. The ARRA also charged the Institute of Medicine (IOM) to prioritize evaluation of medical guidelines and standard medical practices based on patient-centered outcomes and socioeconomic cost. Within that list of IOM priorities were many aspects of cancer care, especially given the demographics of an aging population within the United States. The passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) in 2010 in the United States mandated that every American purchase health insurance coverage, with federal subsidies provided for low-income individuals. These federal subsidies have allowed greater regulatory burden and oversight by the federal government into the practice of medicine. Using reimbursement penalties, hospitals and physicians are required to reduce healthcare costs through ""shared savings"" in Accountable Care Organizations that serve as gatekeepers in healthcare utilization. Irrespective of practice setting, each physician is required to document compliance with ""meaningful use"" regulations. In this changing environment for healthcare delivery, the use of an advanced, and expensive, technology for palliative radiation will need to meet strict patient-centered outcomes and cost efficiency criteria. Palliative care will also need to be more clearly defined, distinguishing treatment of the symptoms of cancer as a chronic disease from end of life care. Clinical trials for the application of advanced radiation therapy technology, especially for palliative care, will need to address QOL and socioeconomic outcomes relative to remaining survival. © 2015 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

This effect is mediated by the perceived entitativity - the perceived cohesiveness or unification of the group-of the expert group.

This study aimed to examine insurance retention and utilization by children initially referred to insurance by our ED insurance linkage program. Methods: We retrospectively examined insurance records of all uninsured children successfully enrolled in public insurance by the insurance linkage program established in our suburban academic ED between 2004 and 2009. Emergency department-enrolled children were matched by age, sex, program, and year of enrollment to a control group of children from the same county who were enrolled in non-ED settings. Wilcoxon signed rank and χ2 tests were used to compare enrollment and claims variables. Results: Emergency department-enrolled children retained insurance for longer, had a higher reenrollment rate, and were higher users of insurance. The average length of enrollment for ED children was 734 days versus 597 days in the control group. Eighty percent of the ED cohort reenrolled in insurance after initial eligibility expiration versus 64% of the control group. Children enrolled via the ED averaged 26 claims (vs 12 claims) and $20,087 (vs $5216) in hospital charges per year of enrollment. This higher utilization was reflected in increased primary care, specialty care, ED visits, inpatient, and mental health claims in the ED group. Conclusions: Emergency department-based insurance enrollment programs have the potential to improve access to health care for children. Policies aimed at expanding insurance enrollment among the uninsured population, including the Affordable Care Act, may consider the ED's potential as an effective enrollment site.

OBJECTIVE: To characterize medical students’ views and knowledge of the ACA and to assess correlates of these views. DESIGN: Cross-sectional email survey. PARTICIPANTS: All 5,340 medical students enrolled at eight geographically diverse U.S. medical schools (overall response rate 52 % [2,761/5,340]). MAIN MEASURES: Level of agreement with four questions regarding views of the ACA and responses to nine knowledge-based questions. KEY RESULTS: The majority of respondents indicated an understanding of (75.3 %) and support for (62.8 %) the ACA and a professional obligation to assist with its implementation (56.1 %). The mean knowledge score from nine knowledge-based questions was 6.9 ± 1.3. Students anticipating a surgical specialty or procedural specialty compared to those anticipating a medical specialty were less likely to support the legislation (OR = 0.6 [0.4–0.7], OR = 0.4 [0.3–0.6], respectively), less likely to indicate a professional obligation to implement the ACA (OR = 0.7 [0.6–0.9], OR = 0.7 [0.5–0.96], respectively), and more likely to have negative expectations (OR = 1.9 [1.5–2.6], OR = 2.3 [1.6–3.5], respectively). Moderates, liberals, and those with an above-average knowledge score were more likely to indicate support for the ACA (OR = 5.7 [4.1–7.9], OR = 35.1 [25.4–48.5], OR = 1.7 [1.4–2.1], respectively) and a professional obligation toward its implementation (OR = 1.9 [1.4–2.5], OR = 4.7 [3.6–6.0], OR = 1.2 [1.02–1.5], respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The majority of students in our sample support the ACA. Support was highest among students who anticipate a medical specialty, self-identify as political moderates or liberals, and have an above-average knowledge score. Support of the ACA by future physicians suggests that they are willing to engage with health care reform measures that increase access to care. © 2015, Society of General Internal Medicine."

First, I argue that the ACA is neither uniformly hostile nor uniformly friendly to efforts to set priorities in ways that promote cost and quality. Second, I argue that the ACA does not take a single, unified approach to priority setting; rather, its guidance varies depending on the aspect of the healthcare system at issue (Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute, Medicare, essential health benefits) and the factors being excluded from priority setting (age, disability, life expectancy). Third, I argue that cost-effectiveness can be achieved within the ACA's constraints, but that doing so will require adopting new approaches to costeffectiveness and priority setting. By limiting the use of standard cost-effectiveness analysis, the ACA makes the need for workable rivals to cost-effectiveness analysis a pressing practical concern rather than a mere theoretical worry. © 2015 American Society of Law, Medicine & Ethics Boston University School of Law."

However, childhood cancer survivors' coverage priorities and familiarity with the ACA are unknown. Methods: Between May 2011 and April 2012, we surveyed a randomly selected, age-stratified sample of 698 survivors and 210 siblings from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study. Results: Overall, 89.8% of survivors and 92.1% of siblings were insured. Many features of insurance coverage that survivors considered ""very important"" are addressed by the ACA, including increased availability of primary care (94.6%), no waiting period before coverage initiation (79.0%), and affordable premiums (88.1%). Survivors were more likely than siblings to deem primary care physician coverage and choice, protections from costs due to pre-existing conditions, and no start-up period as ""very important"" (P < .05 for all). Only 27.3% of survivors and 26.2% of siblings reported familiarity with the ACA (12.1% of uninsured v 29.0% of insured survivors; odds ratio, 2.86; 95% CI, 1.28 to 6.36). Only 21.3% of survivors and 18.9% of siblings believed the ACA would make it more likely that they would get quality coverage. Survivors' and siblings' concerns about the ACA included increased costs, decreased access to and quality of care, and negative impact on employers and employees.

It was gutted by the Senate and replaced with the ACA before being passed and sent back to the House for final passage. The Supreme Court has heard very few cases on the Origination Clause, and Origination Clause challenges have met with little success.

Disparities between groups were narrower among the insured than the uninsured, even after adjusting for income, age, sex, and health status.

One key issue is whether the U.S. will face health care provider shortages as health insurance coverage expands and several health care occupations experience aging and other demographic transitions.

Even so, state administrators' perceptions of their relationship with federal agents appear to vary by the partisan compositions of their respective states, suggesting that political conflict over the reform may pose some dilemmas for future implementation efforts."

Sebelius, Chief Justice Roberts held that Congress' power to regulate under the Commerce Clause could not justify the Individual Mandate to purchase insurance, but that the penalty could be construed as a tax and upheld under the taxing power. Chief Justice Roberts also held the Medicaid Expansion to be an unconstitutional use of spending power, but determined that the Medicaid Expansion could remain with the States having the option to keep existing funding and not expand or expand and take the incremental funding. Eight Justices disagreed with the Chief Justice on the Individual Mandate, and six Justices disagreed with the Chief Justice on the Medicaid Expansion.

How and under what conditions might these goals be achieved? Midwives and physicians have built effective collaborative practice models over a period of 30 years. Empirical study of interprofessional collaboration between midwives and physicians could be useful in guiding professional education, regulation, and health policy in women's health and maternity care. Methods: Construction of a conceptual framework for interprofessional collaboration between midwives and physicians was guided by a review of the literature. A theory derivation strategy was used to define dimensions, concepts, and statements of the framework. Results: Midwife-physician interprofessional collaboration can be defined by 4 dimensions (organizational, procedural, relational, and contextual) and 12 concepts (trust, shared power, synergy, commitment, and respect, among others). The constructed framework provides the foundation for further empirical study of the interprofessional collaborative process. Discussion: The experiences of midwife-physician collaborations provide solid support for a conceptual framework of the collaborative process. A conceptual framework provides a point from which further research can increase knowledge and understanding about how successful outcomes are achieved in collaborative health care practices. Construction of a measurement scale and validation of the model are important next steps. © 2014 by the American College of Nurse-Midwives."

Nestled within the expansive ACA, the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA) set forth an abbreviated pathway to market for ""biosimilar"" and ""interchangeable"" biological products. While the current BPCIA implementation debate focuses chiefly on the scope of scientific and technical assessments by the FDA and the effect on the emergent biosimilar industry, two issues will prove essential for determinations of access to and costs of the resulting products: how the biosimilar and interchangeable biosimilar biologics are to be named, and whether pharmacist substitution is appropriate for products the FDA deems interchangeable. This article examines the current debate surrounding the use of nonproprietary names for biosimilar biologics, as well as state efforts to reconcile automatic substitution laws for the eventual products. In particular, the article addresses the implications for patients and the United States health care system, highlighting the potential negative effect on anticipated cost-savings, hindrances for effective tracking and reporting of adverse events, and a general lack of consistency in state laws. © 2015 American Society of Law, Medicine & Ethics Boston University School of Law."

We provide a detailed analysis of how the dynamics of health insurance coverage (HIC) at older ages differs among Latino, Asian, and European immigrants in the United States. Method. Using Survey of Income and Program Participation data from the 2004 and 2008 panels, we estimate discrete-time event history models to examine first and second transitions into and out of HIC, highlighting substantial differences in hazard rates among immigrants aged 50-64 from Asia, Latin America, and Europe. Results. We find that the likelihood of having HIC at first observation and the rates of gaining and losing coverage within a relatively short time frame are least favorable for older Latino immigrants, although immigrants from all three regions are at a disadvantage relative to native-born non-Hispanic Whites. This disparity among immigrant groups persists even when lower rates of citizenship, greater difficulty with English, and low-skill job placements are taken into account. Discussion. Factors that have contributed to the lower rates and shorter durations of HIC among older immigrants, particularly those from Latin America, may not be easily resolved by the Affordable Care Act. The importance of region of origin and assimilation characteristics for the risk of being uninsured in later life argues that immigration and health care policy should be jointly addressed. © 2015 © The Author 2015.

Meanwhile, studies have indicated a serious shortage in the healthcare workforce and have highlighted the critical role of employees' job-related attitudes and feelings. The main objective of this study was to test whether employees' evaluations of important environments within hospitals were significantly associated with their job-related attitudes and feelings, and whether this relationship varied across different demographic groups. About 700 healthcare professionals from 10 acute-care hospitals run by three healthcare organizations participated in this cross-sectional study. Structural equation modeling found that employees' evaluations of their physical work environment were significantly associated with lower rates of job-related anxiety, higher levels of job satisfaction, and increased rates of organizational commitment. Perceived organizational support was responsible for mediating part of these relationships, indicating that employees can perceive a healthy work environment as a sign of their organization valuing them and caring about their well-being. When distinguishing between different spaces, analysis found that satisfaction with rest areas and work spaces had the largest effect size, while the influence of patient areas was small. Employees newer to the facility and to the organization were more influenced by the physical work environment. This study provides preliminary evidence that facility design can be used as a managerial tool for improving employees' job-related attitudes and feelings and earning their commitment."

Purpose To establish a statewide infrastructure to ensure that low-income Coloradans receive colonoscopy for CRC screening and diagnostic evaluation. Design In 2006, a statewide program to provide free colonoscopy to uninsured Coloradans was developed as a partnership between the University of Colorado Cancer Center and Colorado safety-net clinics. Funded by excise tax revenues, the Colorado Colorectal Screening Program (CCSP) successfully embedded screening into primary care, providing patient navigation support and reimbursement that allowed primary care providers to refer patients for colonoscopy. Setting/participants More than 50 safety-net clinics joined the CCSP to provide colonoscopies to uninsured Coloradans with low income, aged ≥50 years or <50 years at elevated risk, lawfully present and needing CRC screening by American Cancer Society consensus guidelines. Main outcome measures Process and clinical outcomes included people screened, show rates, patient satisfaction, and quality measures, such as adenoma detection rate, bowel cleansing quality, and timeliness of care. Program costs and benefits were estimated. The 2013 analysis was completed using 2006-2012 data on 13,252 of 13,774 people receiving colonoscopy. Results In 2006-2012, the CCSP screened 13,774 people, with 38% minorities and 39% men. Patient navigators ensured >90% of those referred attended their colonoscopy. Adenomas were removed from 27% of patients and 1% had cancers diagnosed. Total direct medical services cost was $998/person receiving colonoscopy. About 325 fewer future incident CRCs were predicted due to adenoma removal, projecting substantial future cost savings. Conclusions The CCSP, a successful community clinic/academic partnership provides cost-effective CRC screening and prevention services to low-income uninsured Coloradans and establishes the infrastructure to support screening low-income Coloradans as Affordable Care Act reforms provide payer coverage for them. © 2015 American Journal of Preventive Medicine."

In recent years, legislative and policy initiatives in the U.S. have been taken to expand MH/SA health insurance benefits and achieve parity with physical health benefits. The relevance of these legislations for international audiences is also explored, particularly for the European context.AIMS OF THE STUDY: This paper reviews the evidence of costs and economic benefits of legislative or policy interventions to expand MH/SA health insurance benefits in the U.S. The objectives are to assess the economic value of the interventions by comparing societal cost to societal benefits, and to determine impact on costs to insurance plans resulting from expansion of these benefits.METHODS: The search for economic evidence covered literature published from January 1950 to March 2011 and included evaluations of federal and state laws or rules that expanded MH/SA benefits as well as voluntary actions by large employers. Two economists screened and abstracted the economic evidence of MH/SA benefits legislation based on standard economic and actuarial concepts and methods.RESULTS: The economic review included 12 studies: eleven provided evidence on cost impact to health plans, and one estimated the effect on suicides. There was insufficient evidence to determine if the intervention was cost-effective or cost-saving. However, the evidence indicates that MH/SA benefits expansion did not lead to any substantial increase in costs to insurance plans, measured as a percentage of insurance premiums.DISCUSSION AND LIMITATIONS: This review is unable to determine the overall economic value of policies that expanded MH/SA insurance benefits due to lack of cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit studies, predominantly due to the lack of evaluations of morbidity and mortality outcomes. This may be remedied in time when long-term MH/SA patient-level data becomes available to researchers. A limitation of this review is that legislations considered here have been superseded by recent legislations that have stronger and broader impacts on MH/SA benefits within private and public insurance: Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008 (MHPAEA) and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA).IMPLICATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH: Economic assessments over the long term such as cost per QALY saved and cost-benefit will be feasible as more data becomes available from plans that implemented recent expansions of MH/SA benefits. Results from these evaluations will allow a better estimate of the economic impact of the interventions from a societal perspective. Future research should also evaluate the more downstream effects on business decisions about labor, such as effects on hiring, retention, and the offer of health benefits as part of an employee compensation package. Finally, the economic effect of the far reaching ACA of 2010 on mental health and substance abuse prevalence and care is also a subject for future research."

A growing body of evidence supports the need for a multi-pronged, clinic-based approach that leverages the synergy between pharmaceutical and lifestyle modification. Recent US policy changes—namely, the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act coupled with recognition of obesity as a disease by the American Medical Association—suggest that financial incentives and attitudes towards obesity management are changing. This paradigm shift has implications for current and future obesity pharmacotherapy. However, barriers to pharmacotherapy utilization include patient and physician perceptions of modest efficacy, historical safety issues, regulatory obstacles, and lack of reimbursement. The shifting attitudes and challenges associated not only with a multi-payer system, but also the lack of clearly defined cross-payer reimbursement strategies, prompted a survey to determine coverage for obesity treatment. Participants indicated that federal/state mandates and growth of quality-driven healthcare initiatives will eventually drive wider pharmacotherapy reimbursement within 1–5 years. There are signs that federal/state programs are already moving towards reimbursement by improving quality measures to track obesity outcomes and reduce costs. Future research on clinical and economic outcomes of combination weight-management programs coupled with innovative approaches (e.g., eHealth) in the real-world setting that demonstrate value to patients, healthcare providers, payers, and employers will help reshape obesity management by reducing barriers and broadening reimbursement coverage for anti-obesity pharmacotherapy. © 2015, The Author(s)."

Little is generally known about these religious organizations and even less critical attention has been brought to bear on them and their ACA exemption. Both deserve close scrutiny due to the exemption’s less than clear legislative justification, their potential influence on the ACA’s policy and ethical success, and their salience to current religious liberty debates surrounding the expansion of religious exemptions from ACA responsibilities for both individuals and corporations. Analyzing documents of the United States’ three largest health care sharing ministries and related material, I examine these organizations and their ACA exemption with particular consideration of their ethical dimensions. Here a thick description of the nature and workings of health care sharing ministries precedes a similar account of the ACA exemption. From these empirical analyses, five ethical and policy concerns emerge: (1) the charity versus insurance status of these ministries; (2) the conflation of two ACA religious exemptions; (3) the tension between the values of religious liberty and of justice; (4) the potential undermining of ACA policy goals; and (5) the questionable compliance of health care sharing ministries with ACA exemption requirements. An accurate and informed understanding of HCSMs is required for policymakers and others to justify the ACA exemption of health care sharing ministry members.

The federally funded increase in reimbursements was aimed at expanding access to primary care for the growing number of Medicaid enrollees. The reimbursement increase expired at the end of 2014 in most states before policymakers had much empirical evidence about its effects.METHODS: We measured the availability of and waiting times for appointments in 10 states during two periods: from November 2012 through March 2013 and from May 2014 through July 2014. Trained field staff posed as either Medicaid enrollees or privately insured enrollees seeking new-patient primary care appointments. We estimated state-level changes over time in a stable cohort of primary care practices that participated in Medicaid to assess whether willingness to provide appointments for new Medicaid enrollees was related to the size of increases in Medicaid reimbursements in each state.RESULTS: The availability of primary care appointments in the Medicaid group increased by 7.7 percentage points, from 58.7% to 66.4%, between the two time periods. The states with the largest increases in availability tended to be those with the largest increases in reimbursements, with an estimated increase of 1.25 percentage points in availability per 10% increase in Medicaid reimbursements (P=0.03). No such association was observed in the private-insurance group. During the same periods, waiting times to a scheduled new-patient appointment remained stable over time in the two study groups.CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides early evidence that increased Medicaid reimbursement to primary care providers, as mandated in the ACA, was associated with improved appointment availability for Medicaid enrollees among participating providers without generating longer waiting times.

Hospital outpatient departments will see, on average, 1.2 to 11.0 additional visits per week, or an average increase of about 2.6 percent nationally. Increases of the magnitude likely to be generated by the Affordable Care Act will have modest effects on the demand for health services, and the existing supply of providers should be sufficient to accommodate this increased demand."

Previous research has identified barriers to CRC screening among African Americans. However we lack a systematic review that synthesizes contributing factors and informs interventions to address persistent disparities. Methods: We conducted a systematic review to evaluate barriers to colonoscopic CRC screening in African Americans. We developed a conceptual model to summarize the patient-, provider-, and system-level barriers and suggest strategies to address these barriers. Results: Nineteen studies met inclusion criteria. Patient barriers to colonoscopy included fear, poor knowledge of CRC risk, and low perceived benefit of colonoscopy. Provider-level factors included failure to recommend screening and knowledge deficits about guidelines and barriers to screening. System barriers included financial obstacles, lack of insurance and access to care, and intermittent primary care visits. Conclusions: There are modifiable barriers to colonoscopic CRC screening among African Americans. Future interventions should confront patient fear, patient and physician knowledge about barriers, and access to healthcare services. As the Affordable Care Act aims to improve uptake of preventive services, focused interventions to increase CRC screening in African Americans are essential and timely. © 2014 Elsevier Inc."

We used data from health insurers operating in northern and central Brooklyn, and New York state hospital ED visit data to investigate the factors influencing ED visits for ambulatory care-sensitive conditions (ACSCs). Logistic regression was used to identify characteristics that predict ED visits not resulting in admission for ACSCs.RESULTS: Of 11,546 patients that completed our survey, the presenting complaint was self-described as emergent by 57%, 30% had no PCP, and 19% reported no health insurance coverage. Using health insurance plan encounter data, only 15 % of patients had seen any provider within 1 week of the ED visit. Insurance type, age, gender, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status of area of residence influence the likelihood of these ED visits.CONCLUSIONS: Correlating data from 3 sources, we suggest that the expansion of insurance under the Affordable Care Act may not be sufficient to reduce ED use for nonurgent conditions.OBJECTIVES: To determine whether the use of the emergency department (ED) for nonurgent care reflects poor access to community-based primary care providers (PCPs)."

Beneficiaries have supplemental insurance to reduce out-of-pocket costs; those without supplemental insurance may face barriers to care. This study examines the association between type of supplemental insurance coverage and receipt of chemotherapy among Medicare patients with cancer who, per National Comprehensive Cancer Network treatment guidelines, should generally receive chemotherapy. Patients and Methods This retrospective, observational study included 1,200 Medicare patients diagnosed with incident cancer of the breast (stage IIB to III), colon (stage III), rectum (stage II to III), lung (stage II to IV), or ovary (stage II to IV) from 2000 to 2005. Using the National Cancer Institute Patterns of Care Studies and linked SEER-Medicare data, we determined each Medicare patient's supplemental insurance status (private insurance, dual eligible [ie, Medicare with Medicaid], or no supplemental insurance), consultation with an oncologist, and receipt of chemotherapy. Using adjusted logistic regression, we evaluated the association of type of supplemental insurance with oncologist consultation and receipt of chemotherapy. Results Dual-eligible patients were significantly less likely to receive chemotherapy than were Medicare patients with private insurance. Patients with Medicare only who saw an oncologist had comparable rates of chemotherapy compared with Medicare patients with private insurance. Conclusion Dual-eligible Medicare beneficiaries received recommended cancer chemotherapy less frequently than other Medicare beneficiaries. With the increasing number of Medicaid patients under the Affordable Care Act, there will be a need for patient navigators and sufficient physician reimbursement so that low-income patients with cancer will have access to oncologists and needed treatment. © 2014 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.

While the adopting of changes is not new for physicians, the pace of change in standards of care, marked by advances and reversals, has accelerated over the course of the past decade.

Physicians have had to simultaneously absorb new processes in the health care system brought about by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act in 2009 and the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in 2010. The ability of physicians to maintain standards of care that focus on individual patients may conflict with changes resulting from new health policies that emphasize population health management.

With over 49 million people covered by Medicare as of 2010, Medicare claims data offer a potentially valuable source that could be used in targeted health care quality improvement efforts. However, little is known about the operating characteristics of provider profiling methods using claims-based outcome measures that may estimate provider performance with error. Motivated by the example of screening mammography performance, we compared approaches to identifying providers failing to meet guideline targets using Medicare claims data. We used data from the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium and linked Medicare claims to compare claims-based and clinical estimates of cancer detection rate. We then demonstrated the performance of claim-based estimates across a broad range of operating characteristics using simulation studies. We found that identification of poor performing providers was extremely sensitive to algorithm specificity, with no approach identifying more than 65% of poor performing providers when claims-based measures had specificity of 0.995 or less. We conclude that claims have the potential to contribute important information on healthcare outcomes to quality improvement efforts. However, to achieve this potential, development of highly accurate claims-based outcome measures should remain a priority. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

Outreach staff and directors from participating MNCAAs and state/local government officials were interviewed.Main Outcome Measure(s): The article highlights a strategy for targeting outreach to individuals eligible for Medicaid coverage or subsidies under the Affordable Care Act by presenting evaluation findings from a unique outreach program to increase access to care for vulnerable populations in Minnesota.Results: Almost two-thirds of applicants were successfully enrolled but lengthy waiting periods persisted. Seventy percent of applications came from health care organizations. Only 13% of applicants assisted by MNCAAs were new to public health care programs. Most MNCAAs believed that the incentive payment-$25 per successful enrollee-was insufficient.Conclusions: Significant expertise in enrolling individuals in public health care programs exists within a core group of community organizations. Incentives to leverage the capacity of community organizations must be accompanied by recruiting and training. Outreach providers and navigators also need timely access to client information.

Goals of the ACA include decreasing the number of uninsured people, controlling cost and spending on health care, increasing the quality of care provided, and increasing insurance coverage benefits. This manuscript focuses on how the ACA affects pharmacy benefit managers and consumers when they have prescriptions dispensed. PBMs use formularies and utilization control tools to steer drug usage toward cost-effective and efficacious agents. A logic model was developed to explain the effects of the new legislation. The model draws from peer-reviewed and gray literature commentary about current and future U.S. healthcare reform. Outcomes were identified as desired and undesired effects, and expected unintended consequences. The ACA extends health insurance benefits to almost 32 million people and provides financial assistance to those up to 400% of the poverty level. Increased access to care leads to a similar increase in overall health care demand and usage. This short-term increase is projected to decrease downstream spending on disease treatment and stunt the continued growth of health care costs, but may unintentionally exacerbate the current primary care physician shortage. The ACA eliminates limitations on insurance and increases the scope of benefits. Online health care insurance exchanges give patients a central location with multiple insurance options. Problems with prescription drug affordability and control utilization tools used by PBMs were not addressed by the ACA. Improving communication within the U.S. healthcare system either by innovative health care delivery models or increased usage of health information technology will help alleviate problems of health care spending and affordability. © 2015 Elsevier Inc."

We grouped states by political party control and compared their reactions across these policy goals. To identify changes in states' rate review programs and anticipated loss ratio requirements in the individual and small group markets since the ACA's enactment, we conducted legal research and contacted each state's insurance regulator. We linked rate review program changes to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' (CMS) criteria for an effective rate review program. We found, of states that did not meet CMS's criteria when the ACA was enacted, most made changes to meet those criteria, including Republican-controlled states, which generally oppose the ACA. This finding is likely the result of the relatively low administrative burden associated with reviewing health insurance rates and the fact that doing so prevents federal intervention in rate review. However, Republican-controlled states were less likely than non-Republican-controlled states to increase their anticipated loss ratio requirements to align with the federal retrospective medical loss ratio requirement, expand Medicaid, and establish state-based exchanges, because of their general opposition to the ACA. We conclude that federal incentives for states to strengthen their health insurance rate review programs were more effective than the incentives for states to adopt other insurance-related policy goals of the ACA. © The Author(s) 2015."

Despite large gains in coverage, studies suggest that Latinos may be less likely than other racial/ethnic groups to apply and enroll in health insurance, and they remain the group with the highest uninsured rate in the United States. We explore two potential factors related to racial/ethnic differences in ACA enrollment-awareness of the law and receipt of application assistance such as navigator services. Using a survey of nearly 3000 low-income U.S. citizens (aged 19-64) in 3 states in late 2014, we find that Latinos had significantly lower levels of awareness of the ACA relative to other groups, even after adjusting for demographic covariates. Higher education was the strongest positive predictor of ACA awareness. In contrast, Latinos were much more likely to receive assistance from navigators or social workers when applying, relative to other racial/ethnic groups. Taken together, these results highlight the importance of ACA outreach efforts to increase awareness among low-income and less educated populations, two groups that are overrepresented in the Latino population, to close existing disparities in coverage. © The Author(s) 2015."

The study sample includes 18,600 adults with SUD but no diagnosable mental health condition. The analysis finds that over 80% of that population receives no treatment and 97% do not perceive a need for treatment. When they do receive treatment, they are more likely to receive mental health treatment. Using multinomial logistic regression, the study finds that having Medicaid or private insurance is associated with higher likelihood of receiving SUD treatment, but only when individuals perceive a need for it, compared to being uninsured and not perceiving a need for treatment (the reference category). These results indicate that increased service utilization is associated with perceiving a need for substance abuse treatment, implying that outreach initiatives to raise awareness about SUD and the effective role of substance use treatment are needed to enhance the impact of the structural changes to the substance abuse treatment system resulting from the ACA. © 2015."

The model tracks the ACA from inception, through passage, March 2010, to its current state. Justification for the need to reform the current health care system rests, in part, on the heels of social justice. Proponents of the ACA have long argued that health reform was needed by the millions of uninsured person who suffered from health disparities, took little advantage of health prevention advice, and faced issues of access to providers as well as insurers. In addition the ACA seeks to address our uncontrollable spending on health care delivery. This article highlights the ACA from a systems perspective. The conceptual model presented encompasses both health reform variables (eg, health care provisions, key legislative components, system environment) and system variables (eg, inputs, outputs, feedback, and throughput) needed to understand current health care reform efforts from a systems perspective.

The responses of states have been diverse and changing. What explains these diverse and dynamic responses? We examine the decision making of states concerning the creation of Pre-existing Condition Insurance Plan programs and insurance marketplaces and the expansion of Medicaid in historical context. This frames our analysis and its implications for future health reform in broader perspective by identifying a number of characteristics of state-federal grants programs: (1) slow and uneven implementation; (2) wide variation across states; (3) accommodation by the federal government; (4) ideological conflict; (5) state response to incentives; (6) incomplete take-up rates of eligible individuals; and (7) programs as stepping-stones and wedges. Assessing the implementation of the three main components of the ACA, we find that partisanship exerts significant influence, yet less so in the case of Medicaid expansion. Moreover, factors specific to the insurance market also play an important role. Finally, we conclude by applying the themes to theACAand offer an outlook for its continuing implementation.

In this rapidly changing environment, a real-time barometer of public opinion with a mechanism to identify emerging issues would be valuable. Objective: We sought to evaluate Twitter's role as a real-time barometer of public sentiment on the ACA and to determine if Twitter sentiment (the positivity or negativity of tweets) could be predictive of state-level marketplace enrollment. Methods: We retrospectively collected 977,303 ACA-related tweets in March 2014 and then tested a correlation of Twitter sentiment with marketplace enrollment by state. Results: A 0.10 increase in the sentiment score was associated with an 8.7% increase in enrollment at the state level (95% CI 1.32-16.13; P=.02), a correlation that remained significant when adjusting for state Medicaid expansion (P=.02) or use of a state-based marketplace (P=.03). Conclusions: This correlation indicates Twitter's potential as a real-time monitoring strategy for future marketplace enrollment periods; marketplaces could systematically track Twitter sentiment to more rapidly identify enrollment changes and potentially emerging issues.

Best practices for CHNAs are still emerging and, along with growing economic pressures, contribute to uncertainty about the short- and long-term costs hospitals will face as a result of the ACA. Purpose: This article describes a community-based partnership coordinated by a nonprofit hospital and a consortium of academic institutions as a model for conducting a CHNA. Key Points: Similar partnerships offer key advantages in complying with the ACA: local academic institutions are existing stakeholders in the community—they possess research expertise and have a vested interested in shaping implementation strategies to improve health; the process of collaborating itself helps to generate community resources, conceive of community health as a shared and iterative enterprise, and mobilize community partners in supporting long-term health priorities. Conclusions: No CHNA is ever perfect, but there are compelling reasons for nonprofit hospitals to seek community-based partnerships, not only because such partnerships comply with the law but, more importantly, because they hold great promise for linking the CHNA process and results to the health realities of local communities, ultimately bolstering community engagement while creating shared health priorities. © 2015 The Johns Hopkins University Press."

Based on the evidence, one has to conclude that containment of health care costs is nowhere in sight, that more than 37 million Americans will still be uninsured when the ACA is fully implemented in 2019, that many more millions will be underinsured, and that profiteering will still dominate the culture of U.S. health care. More fundamental reform will be needed.

We evaluated if payer mix and physician reimbursement by encounter changed between 2013 and 2014 in an academic hospitalist practice in a Medicaid expansion state. This was a retrospective cohort study of all general medicine inpatient admissions to an academic hospitalist group in 2013 and 2014. The proportion of encounters by payer and reimbursement/inpatient encounter were compared in 2013 versus 2014. A sensitivity analysis determined the relative contribution of different factors to the change in reimbursement/encounter. Among 37 540 and 40 397 general medicine inpatient encounters in 2013 and 2014, respectively, Medicaid encounters increased (17.3% to 30.0%, P < .001), uninsured encounters decreased (18.4% to 6.3%, P < 0.001), and private payer encounters also decreased (14.1% to 13.3%, P = .001). The median reimbursement/encounter increased 4.2% from $79.98/encounter in 2013 to $83.36/encounter in 2014 (P < .001). In a sensitivity analysis, changes in length of stay, proportions in encounter type by payer, payer mix, and reimbursement for encounter type by payer accounted for -0.7%, 0.8%, 2.0%, and 2.3% of the reimbursement change, respectively. From 2013 to 2014, Medicaid encounters increased, and uninsured and private payer encounters decreased within our hospitalist practice.

These findings suggest that Affordable Care Act–related Medicaid expansions have successfully decreased the number of uninsured safety net patients in the United States.METHODS We undertook a longitudinal observational study of coverage status for adult visits in community health centers, from 12 months before Medicaid expansion (January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2013) through 6 months after expansion (January 1, 2014 to June 30, 2014). We analyzed data from 156 clinics in the OCHIN practice-based research network, with a shared electronic health record, located in 9 states (5 expanded Medicaid coverage and 4 did not).RESULTS Analyses were based on 333,655 nonpregnant adult patients and their 1,276,298 in-person billed encounters. Overall, clinics in the expansion states had a 40% decrease in the rate of uninsured visits in the postexpansion period and a 36% increase in the rate of Medicaid-covered visits. In contrast, clinics in the nonexpansion states had a significant 16% decline in the rate of uninsured visits but no change in the rate of Medicaid-covered visits.PURPOSE The Affordable Care Act of 2010 supports marked expansions in Med-icaid coverage in the United States.

Quality medical education must be available when the health care provider is ready to learn, provide feedback, and maximize translation of knowledge from desk to clinic. To best accomplish these goals, medical education must be personalized to clinicians' needs. Research has defined multiple knowledge/performance gaps among oncologists who manage advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). A study was conducted to determine the effectiveness with which a personalized learning approach for oncologists will diminish these gaps. Methods: The authors undertook development, online distribution, and impact measurement of an NSCLC curriculum in which learners' responses to a preeducation self-assessment of knowledge, skills, and attitudes resulted in receipt of a personalized curriculum. Upon completion of the assessment, each learner received a personalized curriculum, which included up to 5 distinct activities selected to address identified knowledge and practice gaps. Feedback was provided at the completion of each activity. Results: Ninety-two oncologists completed an individualized learning plan. Analysis shows that completion of the learning plan was associated with a high effect size (d =70). Significant increases were seen in oncologists' ability to correctly identify the rationale for determining histological subtype (13% increase), prevalence of genetic abnormalities (21% increase, p = 04), appropriate use of maintenance therapy (31% increase, p = 01), and appropriate treatment regimens for squamous cell carcinoma (19% increase, p = 003) and of adenocarcinoma (44% increase, p <.001). Discussion: This study demonstrates the feasibility and impact of a personalized targeted curriculum for improving the competence of oncologists treating patients with advanced NSCLC. © 2015 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education, and the Council on Continuing Medical Education, Association for Hospital Medical Education."

Republican congressmen, governors, and Republican candidates have consistently opposed the ACA and have vowed to repeal it. Polls have consistently shown that it is supported by <50% of Americans. The most important goal of the ACA is to improve the health of Americans by increasing the number covered by health insurance. In the first year of its implementation, more than 10 million citizens gained health insurance. The percentage of Americans without health insurance decreased from 18% in July 2013 to 13.4% in June 2014. In addition, the ACA has eliminated many of the negative features of private insurance such as the denial of coverage for those with ""prior conditions."" The benefits of Medicare have been enhanced to decrease the cost of prescription drugs and to eliminate co-pays for preventive services. Despite these positive changes, a near majority of Americans still oppose the ACA, even though they approve of most of its features. They oppose the mandate that all Americans must have health insurance (the individual mandate), and they oppose a government role in health care. Yet Medicare, a mandatory insurance for seniors administered by the federal government since 1965, is overwhelmingly approved by the American public. The opposition to a government role in health care is based on the fact that that the vast majority of our citizens do not trust their government. Republicans are much less trusting of the federal government and much less supportive of a government role in health care than Democrats. The overwhelmingly negative TV ads against the ACA by the Republican candidates in the elections of 2012 and 2014 have had a major impact on Americans' views of the ACA. More than 60% of Americans have stated that most of what they know about the ACA came from watching TV. Opposition to a government role in health care and to mandatory health insurance makes it unlikely that the US will be able to insure that all of its citizens have ongoing access to health care in the near future. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Methods: Medical and dental plans were analyzed across three types of state health insurance Exchanges: State-based (SB), State partnered (SP), and Federally-facilitated (FF). Cost-analysis was completed for 10,427 insurance plans, and health policy expert interviews were conducted. One-way ANOVA compared the cost-sharing structure of stand-alone dental plans (SADP). T-test statistics compared differences in average total monthly pediatric premium costs. Results: No causal relationships were identified between Exchange selection and the pediatric dental benefit's design, regulation or cost. Pediatric medical and dental coverage offered through the embedded plan design exhibited comparable average total monthly premium costs to aggregate cost estimates for the separately purchased SADP and traditional medical plan (P=0.11). Plan designs and regulatory policies demonstrated greater correlation between the SP and FF Exchanges, as compared to the SB Exchange. Conclusions: Parameters defining the pediatric dental benefit are complex and vary across states. Each state Exchange was subject to barriers in improving the quality of the pediatric dental benefit due to a lack of defined, standardized policy parameters and further legislative maturation is required."

The Affordable Care Act Prevention and Public Health Fund is a signal to the field that its work is important and critical to the health of the nation. Recent reports by the Institute of Medicine describe the changing dimensions of public health work in primary care integration and the need for enhanced financing of public health as investment. Gaining knowledge about the public health workforce, that is, how many workers there are and what they are doing, is of growing interest and concern for the field. Although enumeration of the public health workforce has been attempted several times by the federal government beginning as early as 1982, it was not until the year 2000 that a major effort was undertaken to obtain more complete information. Limitations that hampered Enumeration 2000 have persisted however. With implementation of the Affordable Care Act and other new ventures, key federal agencies are developing strategies to pursue a systemic and systematic enumeration and consistent taxonomy process. Included in these efforts is use of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Standard Occupational Classification system. A clear and accurate understanding of the public health workforce and its characteristics is a major challenge. A well-constructed, systematic enumeration process can add to our understanding of the nature and functions of that workforce. In addition, discussion of enumeration must include the need for a consensus within the field that leads to a consistent taxonomy for the public health occupations. This article will provide a stage-setting brief of historical actions regarding enumeration, and it will examine selected enumeration activities taking place currently. It will discuss positive and negative implications facing public health and the potential for enhancing the existing Standard Occupational Classification system to aid enumeration studies.

The purpose of this study is to examine patterns of publicly funded health center use according to patient insurance status (private, public, none), prior to implementation of the Affordable Care Act. Methods National data came from the 2009 Health Center Patient Survey, and were analyzed in 2013. Descriptive analysis of health center patient insurance coverage and health center utilization variables was conducted, followed by adjusted multivariate analysis. Results About 91% of uninsured patients received at least half their annual healthcare visits at a health center, and 86% had at least one usual source of care that included a health center; these rates were not significantly different from those for publicly or privately insured patients. About half of uninsured patients (48%) had long tenures at the health center (â‰¥3 years since first visit), not significantly different from the publicly insured (52%), but lower than the privately insured (63%, p<0.01). Uninsured patients highlighted affordability as the main reason for visiting a health center, whereas insured patients emphasized convenient location and quality of care. Conclusions Insured patients used health centers for the majority of their care, and in similar proportions to their uninsured counterparts. The primary motivation for visiting a health center differed based on insurance type. Future studies should be able to examine whether health center demand across insurance categories follows a similar pattern following the Affordable Care Act insurance coverage expansions. © 2015 American Journal of Preventive Medicine."

Patient behavior will likely be quite different for patients gaining Medicaid than for those gaining private insurance through the Marketplaces. Despite the threat of the individual mandate, not all uninsured patients will enroll, and those who choose to enroll will likely be a different population from those who remain uninsured. New Medicaid enrollees will be a sicker population and will likely increase their number of ED visits substantially. Their acuity will be higher at first but will then revert to the traditionally high number of low-acuity visits made by Medicaid patients. Most patients enrolling through the Marketplace are choosing high-deductible health plans, and they will initially avoid the ED because of high out-of-pocket costs but may present later and sicker after self-rationing their care. Most patients gaining health coverage through the Affordable Care Act will be shifting from uninsured to either Medicaid or private insurance, both of which reimburse more than self-pay, so ED collections should increase. Because of the differences between Medicaid and Marketplace plans, there will be a difference in ED volume, acuity, and financial outcomes, depending on states' current demographics, whether states expand Medicaid, and how aggressively states advertise new options for coverage in Medicaid or state health insurance Marketplaces. © 2015 American College of Emergency Physicians."

This insurance expansion could improve the efficiency of medical care delivery by reducing unnecessary emergency department (ED) use. We evaluated the effect of this provision on ED use among young adults. Methods We used a nationally representative ED visit database of more than 17 million visits from 2007 to 2011. Our analysis compared young adults aged 19 to 25 years (the age group targeted by the law) with slightly older adults aged 27 to 29 years (control group), before and after the implementation of the law. Results The quarterly ED-visit rate decreased by 1.6 per 1,000 population (95% confidence interval 1.2 to 2.1) among targeted young adults after the implementation of the provision, relative to a comparison group. The decrease was concentrated among women, weekday visits, nonurgent conditions, and conditions that can be treated in other settings. We found no effect among weekend visits or visits due to injuries or urgent conditions. The provision also changed the health insurance composition of ED visits; the fraction of privately insured young adults increased, whereas the fraction of those insured through Medicaid and those uninsured decreased. Conclusion The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act dependent coverage expansion was associated with a statistically significant yet modest decrease in ED use, concentrated in the types of ED visits that were likely to be responsive to changes to insurance status. In response to the law, young adults appeared to have altered their visit pattern to reflect a more efficient use of medical care. © 2015 American College of Emergency Physicians."

Community health workers have unique access and local knowledge that can inform program development and evaluation, improve service delivery and care coordination, and expand health care access. As a member of the PPACA-defined health care workforce, CHWs have the potential to positively impact numerous programs and reduce costs.Objective: This article discusses different strategies for integrating CHW models within PPACA implementation through facilitated enrollment strategies, patient-centered medical homes, coordination and expansion of health information technology (HIT) efforts, and also discusses payment options for such integration.Results: Title V of the PPACA outlines a plan to improve access to and delivery of health care services for all individuals, particularly low-income, underserved, uninsured, minority, health disparity, and rural populations. Community health workers' role as trusted community leaders can facilitate accurate data collection, program enrollment, and provision of culturally and linguistically appropriate, patient-and family-centered care. Because CHWs already support disease management and care coordination services, they will be critical to delivering and expanding patient-centered medical homes and Health Home services, especially for communities that suffer disproportionately from multiple chronic diseases. Community health workers' unique expertise in conducting outreach make them well positioned to help enroll people in Medicaid or insurance offered by Health Benefit Exchanges. New payment models provide opportunities to fund and sustain CHWs.Conclusion: Community health workers can support the effective implementation of PPACA if the capacity and potential of CHWs to serve as cultural brokers and bridges among medically underserved communities and health care delivery systems is fully tapped. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and current payment structures provide an unprecedented and important vehicle for integrating and sustaining CHWs as part of these new delivery and enrollment models.

If newly enrolled patients cannot access primary care and instead rely on the ED, they may not enjoy the full benefits of health care services. Objective The objective of the study is to characterize reasons for ED utilization among American adults by insurance status and usual source of care. Design, setting, and participants Cross-sectional analysis of adult sample respondents to the 2013 National Health Interview Survey reporting 1 or more ED visits in the preceding 12 months. Main outcomes and measures Among American ED users that reported no usual source of care and who reported relying on the ED, 27.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 23.6%-32.2%) and 35.1% (95% CI, 28.0%-43.0%) noted at least 1 issue of access and none of acuity as a reason for their last ED visit, as compared to 17.7% (95% CI, 16.3%-19.2%) among those with a stable usual source of care. Conclusions and relevance Although past research has shown that those who lack a stable usual source of care use the ED more often, this is the first population-level study to demonstrate their propensity for lack of access-based utilization. In the wake of the Affordable Care Act, EDs will need to evolve into outlets that service a wider range of health care needs rather than function in their current capacity, which is largely to address acute issues in isolation. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

It evaluates the law’s current status, the benefits it achieved and the legal, economic, political and social challenges that lie ahead. Findings – Although the Supreme Court upheld most of the ACA’s provisions, opponents at the federal and state level are still attempting to overturn or undercut it. The ACA itself is so complicated that it has generated confusion among employers, consumers and even those who are charged with enforcing it. The extent to which the ACA can be successfully implemented is unclear, and adjustments must be made as the federal government struggles to implement key components.

Key elements of the ACA include reforms aimed at addressing high-cost, complex, vulnerable patient populations. Older adults with mental health disorders are a rapidly growing segment of the population and are among the most challenging subgroups within health care, and they account for a disproportionate amount of costs. What does the ACA mean for geriatric mental health? We address this question by highlighting opportunities for reaching older adults with mental health disorders by leveraging the diverse elements of the ACA. We describe nine relevant initiatives: (1) accountable care organizations, (2) patient-centered medical homes, (3) Medicaid-financed specialty health homes, (4) hospital readmission and health care transitions initiatives, (5) Medicare annual wellness visit, (6) quality standards and associated incentives, (7) support for health information technology and telehealth, (8) Independence at Home and 1915(i) State Plan Home and Community-Based Services program, and (9) Medicare-Medicaid Coordination Office, Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation, and the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute.

We grouped states by political party control and compared their reactions across these policy goals. To identify changes in states' rate review programs and anticipated loss ratio requirements in the individual and small group markets since the ACA's enactment, we conducted legal research and contacted each state's insurance regulator. We linked rate review program changes to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' (CMS) criteria for an effective rate review program. We found, of states that did not meet CMS's criteria when the ACA was enacted, most made changes to meet those criteria, including Republican-controlled states, which generally oppose the ACA. This finding is likely the result of the relatively low administrative burden associated with reviewing health insurance rates and the fact that doing so prevents federal intervention in rate review. However, Republican-controlled states were less likely than non-Republicancontrolled states to increase their anticipated loss ratio requirements to align with the federal retrospective medical loss ratio requirement, expand Medicaid, and establish state-based exchanges, because of their general opposition to the ACA. We conclude that federal incentives for states to strengthen their health insurance rate review programs were more effective than the incentives for states to adopt other insurance-related policy goals of the ACA. © The Author(s) 2015."

In particular, the ACA has established the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI), which has been tasked with developing national priorities and funding research aimed at improving health care quality by helping patients and providers make informed health care decisions. PCORI's national priorities span 5 broad domains: person-centered outcomes research, health disparities research, health care systems research, communication and dissemination research, and methodologic research. As these national priorities overlap with the knowledge and skills often emphasized in psychology training programs, initiatives by training programs to bolster strengths in these domains could place trainees at the forefront of this emerging research paradigm. As a part of a new master's program in behavioral health, our program developed a health psychology course modeled around PCORI's 5 national priorities; an initial evaluation in a small sample supported student learning in the 5 PCORI domains. The current report has implications for familiarizing readers with PCORI's national priorities for U.S. health care, stimulating debate surrounding psychology's response to the largest health care paradigm shift in recent U.S. history, and providing a working model for programs seeking to implement PCORI-related changes to their curricula."

ACA benefits CYSHCN through provisions designed to make health insurance coverage universal and continuous, affordable, and adequate. Among the limitations of ACA for CYSHCN are the exemption of plans that had been in existence before ACA, lack of national standards for insurance benefits, possible elimination or reductions in funding for CHIP, and limited experience with new delivery models for improving care while reducing costs.

Despite large gains in coverage, studies suggest that Latinos may be less likely than other racial/ethnic groups to apply and enroll in health insurance, and they remain the group with the highest uninsured rate in the United States. We explore two potential factors related to racial/ethnic differences in ACA enrollment-awareness of the law and receipt of application assistance such as navigator services. Using a survey of nearly 3000 low-income U.S. citizens (aged 19-64) in 3 states in late 2014, we find that Latinos had significantly lower levels of awareness of the ACA relative to other groups, even after adjusting for demographic covariates. Higher education was the strongest positive predictor of ACA awareness. In contrast, Latinos were much more likely to receive assistance from navigators or social workers when applying, relative to other racial/ethnic groups. Taken together, these results highlight the importance of ACA outreach efforts to increase awareness among low-income and less educated populations, two groups that are overrepresented in the Latino population, to close existing disparities in coverage. © The Author(s) 2015."

We examined potential improvements in access to insurance for cancer survivors through adult Medicaid expansions and premium tax credits in the new insurance marketplaces under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Methods: Eligibility for Medicaid and premium tax credits was simulated for cancer survivors age 18 to 64 years in the 2008 to 2010 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey using a detailed deterministic model. Financial hardship was determined as: 1) delays or unmet need for medical, prescription, or dental care because of cost or insurance issues and/or 2) family out-of-pocket medical spending that was 20% or more of gross income. Descriptive analyses were stratified by whether the state of residence chose to expand Medicaid by January 2015. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: Overall, 14.7% of 9.44 million cancer survivors were uninsured, with 18% reporting financial hardship. Under the ACA, 19% overall, 30% of the uninsured, and 39% of those reporting financial hardship would be Medicaid eligible. An additional 10% would be eligible for premium tax credits, with the remainder able to participate in the Marketplace without tax credits. However, 21% of uninsured cancer survivors in states not expanding Medicaid would be ineligible for assistance with coverage. Conclusions: Under the ACA, many of the uninsured and a larger proportion of survivors facing financial hardship will be eligible for Medicaid or premium tax credits in the Marketplaces.

This study estimated the association between the dependent coverage provision and changes in young adults' use of hospital-based services for substance use disorders and non-substance use psychiatric disorders. Method: The authors conducted a quasi-experimental comparison of a national sample of non-childbirth-related inpatient admissions to general hospitals (a total of 2,670,463 admissions, 430,583 of which had primary psychiatric diagnoses) and California emergency department visits with psychiatric diagnoses (N=11,139,689), using data spanning 2005 to 2011. Analyses compared young adults who were targeted by the ACA dependent coverage provision (19-to 25-year-olds) and those who were not (26-to 29-year-olds), estimating changes in utilization before and after implementation of the dependent coverage provision. Primary outcome measures included quarterly inpatient admissions for primary diagnoses of any psychiatric disorder per 1,000 population; emergency department visits with any psychiatric diagnosis per 1,000 population; and payer source. Results: Dependent coverage expansion was associated with 0.14 more inpatient admissions for psychiatric diagnoses per 1,000 for 19-to 25-year-olds (targeted by the ACA) than for 26-to 29-year-olds (not targeted by the ACA). The coverage expansion was associated with 0.45 fewer psychiatric emergency department visits per 1,000 in California. The probability that inpatient admissions nationally and emergency department visits in California were uninsured decreased significantly. Conclusions: ACA dependent coverage provisions produced modest increases in general hospital psychiatric inpatient admissions and higher rates of insurance coverage for young adults nationally. Lower rates of emergency department visits were observed in California."

This study examined whether states more supportive of ACA, meaning those that had opted to expand Medicaid and establish a state-based health insurance exchange, experienced greater growth in physician supply than less supportive states. Methods: Buprenorphine physician supply, including total physician supply, supply of 30-patient physicians, and supply of 100-patient physicians per 100,000 state residents, was measured from June 2013 to May 2015. State characteristics were drawn from multiple secondary sources, with states categorized as ACA-supportive, ACA-hybrid (where states either expanded Medicaid or established a state-based exchange), or ACA-resistant (where states took neither action). Mixed effects regression was used to estimate state-level growth curves to test whether rates of growth varied by states' approaches to implementing ACA. Results: The supply of waivered physicians grew significantly over the two-year period. Rates of growth were significantly lower in ACA-hybrid and ACA-resistant states relative to growth in ACA-supportive states. Average buprenorphine physician supply at baseline varied by region, the percentage of residents covered by Medicaid, and the supply of specialty SUD treatment programs. Conclusions: This study found a positive impact of the ACA on growth in the supply of buprenorphine-waivered physicians in US states.

We designed this study to examine differences in receipt of mental health treatment between low-income uninsured nonelderly adults with serious mental illness (SMI) who were eligible for Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and their existing Medicaid counterparts.

In the United States, the MAP of receiving mental health treatment among Medicaid-only enrollees with SMI (MAP= 70.4%; 95% CI = 65.67%, 74.70%) was 35.9% higher than their uninsured counterparts (MAP= 51.8%; 95% CI = 46.98%, 56.65%). Conclusions. Estimated increases in receipt of mental health treatment because of enrolling in Medicaid among low-income uninsured adults with SMI might help inform planning and implementation efforts for the Medicaid expansion under the ACA."

We evaluated if payer mix and physician reimbursement by encounter changed between 2013 and 2014 in an academic hospitalist practice in a Medicaid expansion state. This was a retrospective cohort study of all general medicine inpatient admissions to an academic hospitalist group in 2013 and 2014. The proportion of encounters by payer and reimbursement/inpatient encounter were compared in 2013 versus 2014. A sensitivity analysis determined the relative contribution of different factors to the change in reimbursement/encounter. Among 37 540 and 40 397 general medicine inpatient encounters in 2013 and 2014, respectively, Medicaid encounters increased (17.3% to 30.0%, P < .001), uninsured encounters decreased (18.4% to 6.3%, P < 0.001), and private payer encounters also decreased (14.1% to 13.3%, P = .001). The median reimbursement/encounter increased 4.2% from $79.98/encounter in 2013 to $83.36/encounter in 2014 (P < .001). In a sensitivity analysis, changes in length of stay, proportions in encounter type by payer, payer mix, and reimbursement for encounter type by payer accounted for -0.7%, 0.8%, 2.0%, and 2.3% of the reimbursement change, respectively. From 2013 to 2014, Medicaid encounters increased, and uninsured and private payer encounters decreased within our hospitalist practice. Reimbursement/encounter also increased, much of which could be attributed to a change in payer mix. Further analyses of physician reimbursement in Medicaid expansion and non-expansion states would further delineate reimbursement changes that are directly attributable to Medicaid expansion. © The Author(s) 2015."

The 2010 Dependent Coverage Provision (DCP) of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) allowed young adults to remain on their parent's health insurance plans until age 26 years, leading to >3 million young adults gaining insurance. We investigated the impact of the DCP on racial disparities in coverage expansion among trauma patients. Study Design Using the 2007-2012 National Trauma Data Bank, we compared changes in coverage among 529,844 19- to 25-year-olds with 484,974 controls aged 27 to 34 years not affected by the DCP. Subgroup analyses were conducted by race and ethnicity and by census region. Results The pre-DCP uninsured rates among young adults were highest among black patients (48.1%) and Hispanic patients (44.3%), and significantly lower among non-Hispanic white patients (28.9%). However, non-Hispanic white young adults experienced a significantly greater absolute reduction in the uninsured rate (-4.9 percentage points) than black (-2.9; p = 0.01) and Hispanic (-1.7; p < 0.001) young adults. These absolute reductions correspond to a 17.0% relative reduction in the uninsured rate for white patients, 6.1% for black patients, and 3.7% for Hispanic patients. Racial disparities in the provision's impact on coverage among trauma patients were largest in the South and West census regions (p < 0.01). Conclusions Although the DCP increased insurance coverage for young adult trauma patients of all races, both absolute and relative racial disparities in insurance coverage widened. The extent of these racial disparities also differed by geographic region. Although this policy produced overall progress toward greater coverage among young adults, its heterogeneous impact by race has important implications for future disparities research in trauma. © 2015 American College of Surgeons."

Little is known about women's perspectives on such reproductive health policies. Study design Data were drawn from the Women's Health Care Experiences and Preferences survey, a randomly selected, nationally representative sample of 1078 US women aged 18-55 years. We examined associations between religious affiliation and attitudes toward employer-provided insurance coverage of contraception and abortion services as well as the exclusion of religious institutions from this coverage. We used chi-square and multivariable logistic regression for analysis. Results Respondents self-identified as Baptist (18%), Protestant (Other Mainline, 17%), Catholic (17%), Other Christian (20%), Religious, Non-Christian (7%) or No Affiliation (21%). Religious affiliation was associated with proportions of agreement for contraception (p=.03), abortion (p<.01) and religious exclusion (p<.01) policies. In multivariable models, differences in the odds of agreement varied across religious affiliations and frequency of service attendance. For example, compared to non-affiliated women, Baptists and Other Nondenominational Christians (but not Catholics) had lower odds of agreement with employer coverage of contraception (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.4-0.1 and OR 0.57, CI 0.4-0.9, respectively); women who attended services weekly or more than weekly had lower odds of agreement (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.3-0.8 and OR 0.33, CI 0.2-0.6, respectively), compared to less frequent attenders. Conclusions Recent religiously motivated legal challenges to employer-provided reproductive health care coverage may not represent the attitudes of many religious women. Implications Recent challenges to the ACA contraceptive mandate appear to equate religious belief with opposition to employer-sponsored reproductive health coverage, but women's views are more complex. © 2015 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The aim of this chapter is to determine if race is independently associated with perceptions of quality of care and access to care after ACA implementation. And, secondarily, we examined if such a relationship remained stable after considering SES (education and income) alone and SES with other relevant individual characteristics. Methodology/approach - Data come from a telephone survey of a representative sample of Georgia residents aged 18 years or older. For each domain of the dependent variables (quality of care and access to care), three models were fitted with a nested design. The first model included only race. The second model included only race and SES. Model 3 included race, SES, and the following individual characteristics: (1) self-rated health status; (2) sense of coherence (SOC; a construct used to explain why some people are more disposed than others to illness after stressful situations); (3) travel time to doctor's office; (4) importance of short wait times as doctor's office; (5) political affiliation; and (6) geographic location (rural/non-rural). Findings - Race was significantly associated with both the quality of care and the access to care. Non-White respondents were more likely to perceive improvements to both as a result of the ACA. Likewise, respondents with either higher education or income were also more likely to perceive improvements in quality and access as a result of the ACA. However, these associations were partly explained by respondents' selfreported political affiliations. Originality/value - Results of this study show that public perceptions toward the ACA and its impact on quality and access to care seem to differ based on an individuals' race, income level and political affiliation. This may be a reflection of the media blitzkrieg that surrounds the ACA rather than a direct consequence of the policy itself. A concerted effort to develop communication strategies and outreach efforts by race and SES that can better educate the general population on the ACA may alleviate some of the reservations that are inherent to any major policy implementation, especially in terms of healthcare quality and access.

Accordingly, medical educators will need to address curricular gaps specific to the ACA and medical practice. Research that gauges osteopathic medical students’ level of understanding of the ACA is needed to inform an evidence-based curriculum. Objective: To assess first- and second-year osteopathic medical students’ beliefs about the ACA. Methods: In this descriptive cross-sectional survey-based study, first- and second-year students were recruited because their responses would be indicative of what, if any, information about the ACA was being covered in the preclinical curriculum. A 30-item survey was distributed in November 2013, after the health insurance exchanges launched on October 1, 2013. Results: A total of 239 first- and second-year osteopathic medical students completed the survey. One hundred ten students (46%) disagreed and 103 (43.1%) agreed that the ACA would provide health insurance coverage for all US citizens. The ACA was predicted to lead to lower wages and fewer jobs (73 students [30.5%]), as well as small business bankruptcy because of employees’ health insurance costs (96 [40.2%]). Regarding Medicare recipients, 113 students (47.3%) did not know whether these individuals would be required to buy insurance through the health insurance exchanges. The majority of students knew that the ACA would require US citizens to pay a penalty if they did not have health insurance (198 [82.8%]) and understood that not everyone would be required to purchase health insurance through health insurance exchanges (137 [57.3%]). Although students took note of certain clinical benefits for patients offered by the ACA, they remained concerned about the ACA’s impact on their professional prospects, particularly in the area of primary care. Conclusion: These findings build on the existing literature that emphasize the need for incorporating into the osteopathic medical curriculum knowledge of the dynamics of health care policy and reform and for creating opportunities for students to follow health policy developments as they evolve in real time. © 2015 American Osteopathic Association."

Assessing the law's effects has major policy implications. OBJECTIVES To estimate national changes in self-reported coverage, access to care, and health during the ACA's first 2 open enrollment periods and to assess differences between low-income adults in states that expanded Medicaid and in states that did not expand Medicaid. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Analysis of the 2012-2015 Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index, a daily national telephone survey. Using multivariable regression to adjust for pre-ACA trends and sociodemographics, we examined changes in outcomes for the nonelderly US adult population aged 18 through 64 years (n = 507 055) since the first open enrollment period began in October 2013. Linear regressions were used to model each outcome as a function of a linear monthly time trend and quarterly indicators. Then, pre-ACA (January 2012-September 2013) and post-ACA (January 2014-March 2015) changes for adults with incomes below 138%of the poverty level in Medicaid expansion states (n = 48 905 among 28 states andWashington, DC) vs nonexpansion states (n = 37 283 among 22 states) were compared using a differences-in-differences approach. EXPOSURES Beginning of the ACA's first open enrollment period (October 2013). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Self-reported rates of being uninsured, lacking a personal physician, lacking easy access to medicine, inability to afford needed care, overall health status, and health-related activity limitations. RESULTS Among the 507 055 adults in this survey, pre-ACA trends were significantly worsening for all outcomes. Compared with the pre-ACA trends, by the first quarter of 2015, the adjusted proportions who were uninsured decreased by 7.9 percentage points (95%CI, -9.1 to -6.7); who lacked a personal physician, -3.5 percentage points (95%CI, -4.8 to -2.2); who lacked easy access to medicine, -2.4 percentage points (95%CI, -3.3 to -1.5); who were unable to afford care, -5.5 percentage points (95%CI, -6.7 to -4.2); who reported fair/poor health, -3.4 percentage points (95%CI, -4.6 to -2.2); and the percentage of days with activities limited by health, -1.7 percentage points (95%CI, -2.4 to -0.9). Coverage changes were largest among minorities; for example, the decrease in the uninsured rate was larger among Latino adults (-11.9 percentage points [95%CI, -15.3 to -8.5]) than white adults (-6.1 percentage points [95%CI, -7.3 to -4.8]). Medicaid expansion was associated with significant reductions among low-income adults in the uninsured rate (differences-indifferences estimate, -5.2 percentage points [95%CI, -7.9 to -2.6]), lacking a personal physician (-1.8 percentage points [95%CI, -3.4 to -0.3]), and difficulty accessing medicine (-2.2 percentage points [95%CI, -3.8 to -0.7]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The ACA's first 2 open enrollment periods were associated with significantly improved trends in self-reported coverage, access to primary care and medications, affordability, and health. Low-income adults in states that expanded Medicaid reported significant gains in insurance coverage and access compared with adults in states that did not expand Medicaid.

To assess the impact of such reform within the Denver Sexual Health Clinic (DSHC), we conducted a survey of patients to better understand our client population and their care-seeking behavior. Methods: Survey data were collected from patients attending the DSHC at 3 different points in time to ascertain insurance status, reasons for not having insurance, reasons for choosing care at the DSHC, and health care use over the past 12 months. Results: A total of 1603 surveys were completed. Forty-two percent of participants were enrolled in health insurance at the time of visit. The percentage of patientswithMedicaid increasedmore than 200%across the survey cycles. Cost was the main reason cited for not having insurance. Participants identified confidentiality and convenience among the top reasons for seeking care at the DSHC regardless of sex or insurance. Although there was no difference in health care use for sexual health services, individuals with health insurance were more likely to have used nonsexual health services in the past 12 months than those without insurance. Conclusions: Patients continue to visit the DSHC despite having health insurance. Sexual health clinics must work to understand what drives people to seek care so that they can better prepare for the future. © 2015 American Sexually Transmitted Diseases Association.

We estimated the effect of the ACA expansion of dependents' coverage on health care expenditures and utilization for young adults by race/ethnicity. Methods. We used difference-in-difference models to estimate the impact of the ACA expansion on health care expenditures, out-of-pocket payments (OOP) as a share of total health care expenditure, and utilization among young adults aged 19 to 26 years by race/ethnicity (White, African American, Latino, and other racial/ethnic groups), with adults aged 27 to 30 years as the control group. Results. In 2011 and 2012, White and African American young adults aged 19 to 26 years had significantly lower total health care spending compared with the 27 to 30 years cohort. OOP, as a share of health care expenditure, remained the same after the ACA expansion for all race/ethnicity groups. Changes in utilization following the ACA expansion among all racial/ethnic groups for those aged 19 to 26 years were not significant. Conclusions. Our study showed that the impact of the ACA expansion on health care expenditures differed by race/ethnicity."

It avoids unnecessary treatments while allowing for curative intervention in cases that progress with time and it has added total cost savings without compromising outcomes compared to immediate treatment. Methods: The 3 foci of the PPACA are to increase access to health care, improve quality of health care delivery and decrease costs. Results: Multiple aspects of the PPACA are likely to impact the choice and delivery of active surveillance for prostate cancer management. Conclusions: Programs including value based purchasing, episode based payments and accountable care organizations as well as increasing use of electronic health records may help promote the delivery of quality, efficient care for Americans. Active surveillance fits well in this model and becomes an attractive option for managing prostate cancer in the new health care environment. © 2015 American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc."

When implemented optimally, Express Lane Eligibility has the potential to help cover more of the millions of eligible children who remain uninsured. Children move frequently between Medicaid and CHIP, and many experienced a gap in coverage with this transition. CHIP enrollees had good access to care. For nearly every health care access, use, care, and cost measure examined, CHIP enrollees fared better than uninsured children. Access in CHIP was similar to private coverage for most measures, but financial burdens were substantially lower and access to weekend and nighttime care was not as good.

As part of this initiative, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services are now tracking quality metrics. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the effects of insurance on the incidence of patient safety indicators (PSIs) and hospital-acquired conditions (HACs) using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample for patients who have brain tumors. METHODS: The Nationwide Inpatient Sample was queried for all hospitalizations between 2002 and 2011 involving patients with brain tumors. Because of the confounding age restriction with Medicare, comparisons were made between Medicaid/self-pay and private insurance. To determine which factors contributed to HACs and PSIs, odds ratios were calculated for each risk factor. Logistic regression models were used to assess the effect of payer status on individual PSIs, HACs, and patient outcomes. RESULTS: Medicaid/self-pay patients had a higher PSI and HAC incidence compared with private insurance patients. The greater incidence of PSIs and HACs correlated with increased length of stay, worse discharge outcomes, and increased in-hospital mortality. CONCLUSION: Variability exists in the incidence of PSIs and HACs in patients with brain tumors based on insurance status. Controlling for both patient and hospital factors can explain these differences. The cause of these disparities should be studied prospectively to begin the process of improving quality metrics in vulnerable patient populations.

The pre-election variability in the states' implementation of these provisions coupled with the large number of states selecting their next governor made the election important at the state level. To better understand the role of health care in the recent gubernatorial elections, we analyzed health policy content presented by 71 candidates for governor on their campaign Web sites. Nearly 80% of all candidates discussed health policy on their Web site, including the subset of the 36 winning governors. The predominant focus of health policy content was on the ACA as a whole or its provisions. Medicaid was discussed more often by candidates in non-expansion states than those from expansion states. Based on the statements of winning governors, we expect serious consideration of the Medicaid expansion to occur in at least 4 states, whereas 2 states may make efforts to reverse course. Relatively few winning governors (33%) mentioned the exchanges. Only 1 expressed interest in switching from the federal exchange to a state exchange, which has particular relevance given the Supreme Court's pending decision on King v.

As a result, local health departments are reevaluating their roles, objectives, and the services they provide. Objective: We gathered perspectives on the current and future impact of the ACA on governmental public health departments from leaders of local health departments in the Big Cities Health Coalition, which represents some of the largest local health departments in the country. Design: We conducted interviews with 45 public health officials in 16 participating Big Cities Health Coalition departments. We analyzed data reflecting participants' perspectives on potential changes in programs and services, as well as on challenges and opportunities created by the ACA. Results: Respondents uniformly indicated that they expected ACA to have a positive impact on population health. Most participants expected to conduct more population-oriented activities because of the ACA, but there was no consensus about how the ACA would impact the clinical services that their departments could offer. Local health department leaders suggested that the ACA might create a broad range of opportunities that would support public health as a whole, including expanded insurance coverage for the community, greater opportunity to collaborate with Accountable Care Organizations, increased focus on core public health issues, and increased integration with health care and social services. Conclusions: Leaders of some of the largest health departments in the United States uniformly acknowledged that realignments in funding prompted by the ACA are changing the roles that their offices can play in controlling infectious diseases, providing robust maternal and child health services, and more generally providing a social safety net for health care services in their communities. Health departments will continue to need strong leaders to strengthen and maintain their critical role in protecting and promoting the health of the public they serve. © 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health."

However, 40 percent of people who should receive colorectal cancer screenings do not receive them. Colonoscopies are the most thorough method of screening because they allow physicians to view the entire length of the colon and remove polyps as needed. Billing methods that distinguish between screening and therapeutic procedures have kept expected colonoscopy costs high. However, the Affordable Care Act partially closed the so-called colonoscopy loophole and reduced expected out-of-pocket expenses for all Medicare beneficiaries. Using data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, we found that annual colonoscopy rates among men ages 66-75 increased significantly (by 4.0 percentage points) after the Affordable Care Act policy change, and we found some evidence of even larger increases among socioeconomically disadvantaged men. We found no significant increases among women, a result that may be explained by health behavior and other factors and that requires further study. Our research indicates that cost may be an important barrier to colorectal cancer screening, at least among men, and that making further policy changes to close remaining loopholes may improve screening rates. © 2015 Project HOPE-The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc."

Starting in fiscal year 2013, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services reduces all inpatient prospective payment system reimbursements by 1%. This money then can be returned to hospitals in the form of a bonus through VBP. Value-based purchasing holds hospitals accountable for both cost and quality. With VBP, hospitals get a score that is based on the process of care, the outcomes, and patient-centeredness. This means that reimbursements in health care, which keep hospitals in business, are transitioning from “volume of services” to VBP.

Data Collection Primary data were collected using an online questionnaire. Principal Findings Uninsured who were more numerate showed higher health insurance comprehension; those with more health insurance comprehension made choices of health insurance plans more consistent with their stated preferences; and those who made choices more concordant with their stated preferences were less likely to choose a plan that cost more than $500 in excess of the cheapest plan available.

The Affordable Care Act (ACA) addresses this challenge in part by providing tax subsidies to qualified individuals for purchasing individual insurance and retaining tax exemptions for employer and employee contributions to the cost of premiums of employer-sponsored insurance. These tax exemptions cost approximately $250 billion annually in lost tax revenue and have been criticized for favoring higher earners and conferring preferential treatment of employer-sponsored over individual insurance. We analyzed three options for leveling the financial playing field between the two insurance markets by reallocating the value of tax benefits of employer coverage. We found that one option that uses the subsidy formula employed in the insurance Marketplaces under the ACA for both the individual and employer-sponsored insurance markets, and additionally requires the subsidy to be at least $1,250 without an upper income limit on subsidy eligibility imposed, could expand insurance coverage and reduce individual market premiums relative to the ACA with no additional federal spending. © 2015 Project HOPE-The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc."

Methods: Insurance status and enrollment experiences came from the Minnesota Health Insurance Transitions Study (MH-HITS), a follow-up telephone survey of children and adults in Minnesota who had no health insurance in the fall of 2013. Results: ACA had a tempered success in Minnesota. Outreach and enrollment efforts were effective; one half of those previously uninsured gained coverage, although many reported difficulty signing up (nearly 62%). Of the previously uninsured who gained coverage, 44% obtained their coverage through MNsure, Minnesota's insurance marketplace. Most of those who remained uninsured heard of MNsure and went to the Web site. Many still struggled with the enrollment process or reported being deterred by the cost of coverage. Conclusions: Targeting outreach, simplifying the enrollment process, focusing on affordability, and continuing funding for in-person assistance will be important in the future."

Methods: We used Medical Expenditure Panel Survey data from 2006 to 2012 to examine young adults' receipt of routine care in the preceding year, identification of a USC, and USC provider specialties (pediatrics, family medicine, internal medicine, and obstetrics and gynecology). Results: The percentage of young adults who sought routine care increased from 42.4% in 2006 to 49.5% in 2012 (P <.001). The percentage identifying a USC remained stable at approximately 60%. Among young adults with a USC, there was a trend between 2006 and 2012 toward increasing percentages with pediatric (7.6% vs 9.1%) and family medicine (75.9% vs 80.9%) providers and declining percentages with internal medicine (11.5% vs 7.6%) and obstetrics and gynecology (5.0% vs 2.5%) providers. Conclusions: Efforts under the ACA to increase health insurance coverage had favorable effects on young adults' use of routine care. Monitoring routine care use and USC choices in this group can inform primary care workforce needs and graduate medical education priorities across specialties."

This element of the law was meant to protect patients with chronic or catastrophic conditions from facing bankruptcy despite having - seemingly - ro-bust health insurance. Notwithstanding this provision, the agencies responsible for implementing the law have informally stated that insurers may convert the statutorily prohibited dollar caps into frequency or duration limitations on benefits. These new forms of benefit limits have the potential to be worse for those with chronic conditions than the simpler dollar caps, and will distort the market in perverse ways. Additionally, these new limits are contrary to the statutory language and purpose. This Essay challenges the agencies' guidance on this issue as an improper interpretation of the statute, and furthermore, bad policy. Part I explains the law's provision on annual and lifetime limits and then describes the current implementation of these provisions. Part II describes the negative real-world effects this implementation is having on those beneficiaries whom the law was meant to help. Part III looks at the statutory interpretation of the provision and analyzes the amount of deference a court would give to the agency interpretation of this issue. Part IV calls on the responsible agencies to issue a bright-line rule in accordance with the statute that would prohibit all annual or lifetime limits to essential health benefits, or else to conduct a more thorough and transparent process to address the topic. Until this occurs, insurers will perversely be free to apply more restrictive annual limits to the sickest beneficiaries because of an interpretation of a statute that was meant to end such limits outright."

The objective of this study was to assess the potential of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) of 2010 to improve diabetes care through increased health care access by comparing health care and health outcomes of insured and uninsured people with diabetes. Methods: We examined demographics, access to care, health care use, and health care expenditures of adults aged 19 to 64 years with diabetes by using the 2011 and 2012 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. Bivariate descriptive statistics comparing insured and uninsured persons were evaluated separately by income above and below 138% of the federal poverty level (FPL), (a threshold for expanded Medicaid eligibility in select states under the ACA) using the t test and proportion and median tests. Results: Uninsured adults reported poorer access to care than insured adults, such as having a usual source of health care (69.0% vs 89.5% [≤138% FPL], 77.1% vs 94.6% [>138% FPL], both P < .001) and having lower rates of 6 key diabetes preventive care services (P ≤ .05). Insured adults with diabetes had significantly higher health care expenditures than uninsured adults ($13,706 vs $4,367, $10,838 vs $4,419, respectively, both P < .001). Conclusion: Uninsured adults with diabetes had less access to health care and lower levels of preventive care, health care use, and expenditures than insured adults. To the extent that the ACA increases access and coverage, uninsured people with diabetes are likely to significantly increase their health care use, which may lead to reduced incidence of diabetes complications and improved health."

Its purpose is to provide uninsured Americans a means for affording health insurance, but it also contains legislation reforming how providers and healthcare institutions are paid by Medicare. Medicare provides insurance coverage for US seniors over 65 years of age or for certain disabled individuals. The components of Medicare medical coverage include Part A, which provides coverage for hospital stays, post-hospital nursing facilities, and home healthcare; Part B, which pays most routine doctor and lab costs, medical equipment and supplies, additional home healthcare, and physical therapy; Part C in which beneficiaries are enrolled in private health plans that are approved by Medicare; and Part D, which pays some of prescription medication costs. Although Medicare recipients do not participate in the ACA per se, the ACA does impact them in a variety of ways, through enhanced preventive care coverage, lowered costs on prescription drugs, reduced or stable monthly premiums, and improved quality and access to care. Payment reforms in Medicare, brought about by the ACA, are changing how providers and institutions are reimbursed for providing healthcare to Medicare beneficiaries, focusing more on the quality of the healthcare received, thereby, tying good practice to good reimbursement rates. In addition, the ACA is impacting Medicare by enacting new programs to reduce fraudulent claims, enhancing the Medicare program overall.

We investigated social, reproductive, and attitudinal factors associated with women's disagreement with the passage of the ACA. Methods: Data were drawn from the Women's Health Care Experiences and Preferences Study, our population-based internet survey of 1,078 randomly sampled United States women ages 18-55 years conducted in September 2013. Items measured ACA attitudes, including disagreement with the ACA's passage. We examined relationships between ACA disagreement, sociodemographic and reproductive characteristics, health service experiences, and reproductive health care and policy attitudes with logistic regression. Results: Among women who had heard of the ACA (n=888), 35% disagreed with it and 38% did not know how they felt. Black women (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.12, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.03-0.55) and women with incomes of >$75k (aOR 0.38, CI 0.17-0.88), Medicare/Medicaid insurance (aOR 0.24, CI 0.10-0.61), and infrequent religious service attendance (aOR 0.57, CI 0.35-0.93) were less likely to disagree with the ACA's passage, compared with their counterparts. Republican party affiliation was the strongest predictor of ACA disagreement (aOR 17.10, CI 9.12-32.09). Negative beliefs about the ACA's ability to improve access to preferred care and regarding employers' and the government's roles in reproductive health care were positively associated with ACA disagreement. Conclusions: Many women who could benefit from the ACA disagree with or do not know how they feel about its passage, which may influence participation in ACA benefits and services. © 2015 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc."

Secretary of U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and Hobby Lobby Stores v. Sebelius, along with recent federal court decisions, has highlighted the ongoing controversy over the scope of the Affordable Care Act's (ACA's) contraceptive coverage requirement, which requires an employer to provide certain contraceptive coverage to its employees under its group health plan. Some employers have objected to the requirement, citing objections to the facilitation of the use of contraceptives in conflict with the religious tenets by which their businesses operate. An analogous issue has arisen in state courts in the context of same-sex weddings. Several private businesses that qualify as public accommodations have objected to state requirements that they provide services without discriminating based on sexual orientation despite the owners' religious objections to same-sex marriage. These issues have raised a novel legal question for the courts: What rights do secular businesses that operate for profit have to pursue legal claims to protect their religious exercise? Although a number of statutory exemptions exist to protect individuals and organizations' religious beliefs and objections (e.g., employment discrimination under Title VII, disability discrimination under the Americans with Disabilities Act, etc.), courts have applied those exemptions only to individuals and nonprofit, religious organizations. A number of legal challenges to the contraceptive coverage requirement have examined a range of questions related to the rights of these businesses. As a threshold question, courts have had to analyze whether the business itself is eligible for protection under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) and Free Exercise jurisprudence. The businesses have asserted that they qualify as ""persons"" under RFRA and, in the alternative, that they are entitled to pursue their claims on behalf of their owners under what is known as the ""pass-through"" theory of corporate rights. Courts have also considered whether the business owners may pursue independent legal claims asserting their objections, or if their individual rights are forfeited at the time of the company's incorporation. If a court determines that the business or its owners are eligible for free exercise protection, it may then consider the merits of the case, including whether the mandate constitutes a substantial burden on religious exercise; whether the government has a compelling interest to do so; and whether the government used the least restrictive means to achieve that interest. Five federal circuit courts have considered these questions in the context of the contraceptive coverage requirement, and have reached different conclusions on the range of questions raised. This report examines the constitutional and statutory protections related to free exercise of religion, including current Supreme Court interpretations, as well as judicial and legislative avoidance of defining the parameters of religious belief. It also discusses significant examples of existing religious exemptions in current law, including employment nondiscrimination, health care, and public accommodations law. Finally, it analyzes recent federal judicial decisions that have considered the religious freedom rights of commercial entities whose owners have religious objections to the contraceptive coverage requirement. © 2015 Nova Science Publishers, Inc."

MTM services have been found to improve patient outcomes from pharmacotherapy, reduce emergency room visits and hospitalizations, and reduce health care costs in a cost-effective fashion. However, previous research found that non-Hispanic blacks (blacks) and Hispanics may be less likely to be eligible for MTM services than non-Hispanic whites (whites) among the Medicare population, according to current Medicare MTM eligibility criteria. This finding is because Medicare MTM eligibility criteria are predominantly based on medication use and costs, and blacks and Hispanics tend to use fewer prescription medications and incur lower prescription medication costs. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) laid out a set of MTM eligibility criteria for eligible entities to target patients for MTM services: ""(1) take 4 or more prescribed medications ...; (2) take any 'high risk' medications; (3) have 2 or more chronic diseases ... or (4) have undergone a transition of care, or other factors ... that are likely to create a high risk of medication-related problems."" OBJECTIVES: To (a) examine racial/ethnic disparities in meeting the eligibility criteria for MTM services in PPACA among the Medicare population and (b) determine whether there would be greater disparities in health and economic outcomes among MTM-ineligible than MTM-eligible groups. METHODS: This was a retrospective cross-sectional analysis of the Medicare Current Beneficiaries Survey (2007-2008). To determine medication characteristics, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Electronic Orange Book was also used. Proportions of the population eligible for MTM services based on PPACA MTM eligibility criteria were compared across racial and ethnic groups using a chi-square test; a logistic regression model was used to adjust for population sociodemographic and health characteristics. Health and economic outcomes examined included health status (self-perceived good health status, number of chronic diseases, activities of daily living [ADLs], and instrumental activities of daily living [IADLs]), health services utilization and costs (physician visits, emergency room visits, and total health care costs), and medication use patterns (generic dispensing ratio). To determine difference in disparities across MTM eligibility categories, difference-in-differences regressions of various functional forms were employed, depending on the nature of the dependent variables. Interaction terms between the dummy variables for minority groups (e.g., blacks or Hispanics) and MTM eligibility were included to test whether disparity patterns varied between MTM-ineligible and MTM-eligible individuals.RESULTS: The sample consisted of 12,966 Medicare beneficiaries, of which 11,161 were white, 930 were black, and 875 were Hispanic. Of the study sample, 9,992 whites (86.4%), 825 blacks (86.3%), and 733 Hispanics (80.6%) were eligible for MTM. The difference between whites and Hispanics was significant (P < 0.050), and the difference between whites and blacks was not significant (P > 0.050). In multivariate analyses, significant disparity in eligibility for MTM services was found only between Hispanics and whites (odds ratio [OR] = 0.59; 95% CI = 0.43-0.82) but not between blacks and whites (OR = 0.78; 95% CI = 0.55-1.09). Disparities were greater among the MTM-ineligible than the MTM-eligible populations in self-perceived health status, ADLs, and IADLs for both blacks and Hispanics compared with whites. When analyzing the number of chronic conditions, the number and costs of physician visits, and total health care costs, the authors of this study found lower racial and ethnic disparities among the ineligible population than the eligible population. CONCLUSIONS: Hispanics are significantly less likely than whites to qualify for MTM among the Medicare population, according to MTM eligibility criteria stipulated in the PPACA. PPACA MTM eligibility criteria may aggravate existing racial and ethnic disparities in health status but may remediate racial and ethnic disparities in health services utilization. Alternative MTM eligibility criteria other than PPACA MTM eligibility criteria may be needed to improve the efficiency and equity of access to Medicare Part D MTM programs. © 2015, Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy."

While the projects described here are an important focus, the article argues that they are primarily valuable in showing how a regional resource exchange network can be set up over a period of decades and how the presence of these partnerships creates the possibility for one project to chain into another. We describe this chaining as a resource exchange network and as a “virtual organization.” Virtual organizations are intentionally created, possess internal logic, and contain a set of actors who carry out interdependent roles. Virtual organizations lack formal structure and require a minimum of organizational maintenance.

In addition, the number of conscientious objectors has grown because hospital consolidation has increased the dominance of the Ethical and Religious Directives, which limits the care provided by Catholic hospitals. But a little noticed provision of the ACA—Section 1557—expresses new congressional commitment to equality in access to care. Section 1557 incorporates into federal healthcare law a robust definition of sex discrimination that may limit conscientious objectors’ ability to deny patients necessary reproductive health services as well as information about their health status. The law’s nondiscrimination provision requires a more equitable balance between the religious liberty of medical providers and patients’ rights to care and information. © 2015, Yale Law Journal.

Methods: In 2013, we surveyed persons who used publicly funded STD clinics in 21 US cities with the highest STD morbidity. Results: Of the 4364 STD clinic patients we surveyed, 58.5% were younger than 30 years, 72.5% were non-White, and 49.9% were uninsured. They visited the clinic for STD symptoms (18.9%), STD screening (33.8%), and HIV testing (13.6%). Patients chose STD clinics because of walk-in, same-day appointments (49.5%), low cost (23.9%), and expert care (8.3%). Among STD clinic patients, 60.4% had access to another type of venue for sick care, and 58.5% had access to another type of venue for preventive care. Most insured patients (51.6%) were willing to use insurance to pay for care at the STD clinic. Conclusions: Despite access to other health care settings, patients chose STD clinics for sexual health care because of convenient, low-cost, and expert care. Policy Implication.

Methods: From January to February 2014 and from August to September 2014, we searched provider directories for networks of primary care physicians and selected pediatric specialists participating in Marketplace, Medicaid, and CHIP in 6 market areas of the United States and calculated the degree to which networks overlapped. Results: Networks of physicians in Medicaid and CHIP were nearly identical, meaning transitions between those programs may not result in much physician disruption. This was not the case for Marketplace and Medicaid and CHIP networks. Conclusions: Transitions from the Marketplace to Medicaid or CHIP may result in different degrees of physician disruption for consumers depending on where they live and what type of Marketplace product they purchase."

However, it has not been clear how best to put incentives into practice, and how the implementation of shared decision making and the use of patient decision aids would be measured. Our goal was to review developments and proposals put forward. Methods: We performed a qualitative document analysis following a pragmatic search of Medline, Google, Google Scholar, Business Source Complete (Ebscohost), and LexisNexis from 2009-2013 using the following key words: ""Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act"", ""Decision Making"", ""Affordable Care Act"", ""Shared Decision Making"", ""measurement"", ""incentives"", and ""payment."" Results: We observed a lack of clarity about how to measure shared decision making, about how best to reward the use of patient decisions aids, and therefore how best to incentivize the process. Many documents clearly imply that providing and disseminating patient decision aids might be equivalent to shared decision making. However, there is little evidence that these tools, when used by patients in advance of clinical encounters, lead to significant change in patient-provider communication. The assessment of shared decision making for performance management remains challenging. Conclusion: Efforts to incentivize shared decision making are at risk of being limited to the promotion of patient decision aids, passing over the opportunity to influence the communication processes between patients and providers. © 2015 TheAuthors."

The justification for curtailment of other public programs is that after Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act, the decrease in the proportion of uninsured among the U.S. population will render disproportionate-share hospital payments extraneous and unnecessary. Such justification was reiterated in the recent American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Committee Opinion No. 627, entitled Health Care for Unauthorized Immigrants. Herein, the soundness of the Committee Opinion's proposed policy is evaluated by reviewing available literature on the potential effect of Medicaid disproportionate-share hospital cuts with and without concomitant Medicaid expansion. Limitations of Medicaid expansion efforts before and under the Affordable Care Act, the disproportionate-share hospital payment program, and other legislation providing safety net hospitals with (some) relief of financial burdens related to uncompensated care are explicated. Findings raise concern that acceptance of cuts of up to 75% of federal disproportionate-share hospital funds on the premise that nationwide state expansion of Medicaid will offset the difference may be overly optimistic. Indeed, foregoing disproportionate-share hospital payments undercuts the otherwise laudable intent of Committee Opinion No. 627, namely to advocate for universal health care for all women, including undocumented immigrants. © 2015 by The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

Method: A national sample of 317 SUD treatment providers were studied in a period after the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act was enacted (2009) and meaningful use EHR requirements were established (2010), but before implementation of the Affordable Care Act. The study sample was selected using stratified random sampling and was part of a longitudinal study of treatment providers across the United States. Results: After we controlled for potentially confounding variables, four components of ESO had a significant relationship with EHR implementation. Levels of slack resources in an organization moderated the relationship of ESO with meaningful use of EHRs, increasing the strength of the relationship for some components but reducing the strength of others. Conclusions: From a policy and practice perspective, the results suggest that training and education to develop higher levels of ESO within SUD treatment organizations are likely to increase their level of meaningful use of EHRs, which in turn may enhance the integration of SUD treatment with primary medical providers, better preparing SUD treatment providers for the environmental changes of the Affordable Care Act. © 2015, Alcohol Research Documentation Inc.

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act represents a substantial effort to improve access and emphasizes value-based care. Value in health care has been defined as health outcomes for the patient per dollar spent. However, given the opacity of health outcomes and cost, the identification and quantification of patient-centered value is problematic. These problems are magnified by highly technical, specialized care (eg, neurosurgery). This is further complicated by potentially competing interests of the 5 major stakeholders in health care: patients, doctors, payers, hospitals, and manufacturers. These stakeholders are watching with great interest as health care in the United States moves toward a value-based system. Market principles can be harnessed to drive costs down, improve outcomes, and improve overall value to patients. However, there are many caveats to a market-based, value-driven system that must be identified and addressed. Many excellent neurosurgical efforts are already underway to nudge health care toward increased efficiency, decreased costs, and improved quality. Patient-centered shared value can provide a philosophical mooring for the development of health care policies that utilize market principles without losing sight of the ultimate goals of health care, to care for patients.

They are less healthy than adolescents, and they also show a worse health profile than those in their late 20s and 30s. The Affordable Care Act provisions to extend coverage for young adults are well known, and some states had already been pursuing similar efforts before the Affordable Care Act was enacted. These initiatives have resulted in important gains in young adults' heath care coverage. However, too little attention has been paid to the care that young adults receive once they are in the system. Given young adults' health problems, this is a critical omission. The Institute of Medicine and National Research Council recently released a report titled Investing in the Health and Well-Being of Young Adults. The report concludes that young adulthood is a critical developmental period and recommends that young adults ages 18-26 years be treated as a distinct subpopulation in policy, planning, programming, and research. The report also recommends action in three priority areas to improve health care for young adults: improving the transition from pediatric to adult medical and behavioral health care, enhancing preventive care for young adults, and developing evidence-based practices. © 2015 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine."

Given this synergy, many phenomena that nursing scientists study could become topics of a competitive proposal for PCORI funding. Major aspects of PCORI funding with implications for nurse researchers include the nature of the questions asked, funding priorities, engagement of patients and stakeholders, compliance with the PCORI's methodology standards, and the proposal review criteria and process. © 2014 Wolters Kluwer Health Lippincott Williams & Wilkins."

However, there does not appear to be a substantive difference in geographic access as measured by the percentage of people residing in at least one hospital market area.

To better understand the effect of new Medicaid coverage on CHC use over time, we studied Oregon’s 2008 randomized Medicaid expansion (the “Oregon Experiment”). METHODS We probabilistically matched demographic data from adults (aged 19-64 years) participating in the Oregon Experiment to electronic health record data from 108 Oregon CHCs within the OCHIN community health information network (originally the Oregon Community Health Information Network) (N = 34,849). We performed intent-to-treat analyses using zero-inflated Poisson regression models to compare 36-month (2008-2011) usage rates among those selected to apply for Medicaid vs not selected, and instrumental variable analyses to estimate the effect of gaining Medicaid coverage on use. Use outcomes included primary care visits, behavioral/mental health visits, laboratory tests, referrals, immunizations, and imaging. RESULTS The intent-to-treat analyses revealed statistically significant differences in rates of behavioral/mental health visits, referrals, and imaging between patients randomly selected to apply for Medicaid vs those not selected. In instrumental variable analyses, gaining Medicaid coverage significantly increased the rate of primary care visits, laboratory tests, referrals, and imaging; rate ratios ranged from 1.27 (95% CI, 1.05-1.55) for laboratory tests to 1.58 (95% CI, 1.10-2.28) for referrals. CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that use of many different types of CHC services will increase as patients gain Medicaid through Affordable Care Act expansions. To maximize access to critical health services, it will be important to ensure that the health care system can support increasing demands by providing more resources to CHCs and other primary care settings. © 2015, Annals of Family Medicine, Inc.

We analyzed national survey data from 2011 to 2012 and found that despite its far poorer population, Puerto Rico outperforms the mainland United States on several measures of health care coverage and access to care. While the ACA significantly increases federal resources in Puerto Rico, ongoing federal restrictions on Medicaid funding and premium tax credits in Puerto Rico pose substantial health policy challenges in the territory. Context Puerto Rico is the United States' largest territory, home to nearly 4 million American citizens. Yet it has remained largely on the outskirts of US health policy, including the Affordable Care Act (ACA). This article presents an overview of Puerto Rico's health care system and a comparative analysis of coverage and access to care in Puerto Rico and the mainland United States. Methods We analyzed 2011-2012 data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, and 2012 data from the American Community Survey and its counterpart, the Puerto Rico Community Survey. Among adults 18 and older, we examined health insurance coverage; access measures, such as having a usual source of care and cost-related delays in care; self-reported health; and the receipt of recommended preventive services, such as cancer screening and glucose testing. We used multivariate regression models to compare Puerto Rico and the mainland United States, adjusted for age, income, race/ethnicity, and other demographic variables. Findings Uninsured rates were significantly lower in Puerto Rico (unadjusted 7.4% versus 15.0%, adjusted difference: -12.0%, p < 0.001). Medicaid was far more common in Puerto Rico. Puerto Rican residents were more likely than those in the mainland United States to have a usual source of care and to have had a checkup within the past year, and fewer experienced cost-related delays in care. Screening rates for diabetes, mammograms, and Pap smears were comparable or better in Puerto Rico, while colonoscopy rates were lower. Self-reported health was slightly worse, but obesity and smoking rates were lower. Conclusions Despite its far poorer population, Puerto Rico outperforms the mainland United States on several measures of coverage and access. Congressional policies capping federal Medicaid funds to the territory, however, have contributed to major budgetary challenges.

However, a sizable number of people remain uninsured because they live in states that have not expanded Medicaid coverage or because they feel that Marketplace coverage is not affordable.

Patients were quoted a mean price of $160. Significantly lower prices for the uninsured were offered by family practice offices compared to general internists, in offices participating in Medicaid managed care plans, and in federally qualified health centers. Prices were also lower for offices in ZIP codes with higher poverty rates. Only 18 percent of uninsured callers were told that they could bring less than the full amount to the visit and arrange to pay the rest later.

Although the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) has a long history of developing the content of evidence, the agency now pivots to close that gap by focusing on evidence dissemination and implementation. Achieving better health outcomes requires both the generation of new patient-centered outcomes research (PCOR) knowledge and the appropriate and timely implementation of that knowledge into practice. The Affordable Care Act provided funds to support both types of PCOR efforts, with AHRQ building on years of experience to advance research dissemination and implementation. This article describes the work the AHRQ has done, is doing, and will do in the future. To communicate PCOR evidence findings, AHRQ is currently synthesizing research findings into convincing collections of evidence that can be best taken up by clinicians, patients and caregivers, and policymakers. The future direction for AHRQ is to improve the context for evidence and practice improvement, thereby creating an environment receptive to PCOR. Toward this goal, AHRQ is actively engaging partners, such as professional societies and insurers, to make evidence central to decision making. In addition, AHRQ recently launched two programs that seek to both understand and encourage the use of evidence in clinical practice.

The authorities provided by the Affordable Care Act give Medicaid new resources and opportunities to improve coverage and perinatal care. Given that the Medicaid program currently covers almost half of all births in the United States, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, working in partnership with states and other stakeholders, is using new and existing authorities to improve birth outcomes. Quality measurement, quality-improvement projects, and expanded models of care underscore the major quality approach of the center.

Results: On average, LHDs provided approximately 13 (36%) of 35 possible services either directly or by contract. Rather than cut services or externally consolidating, LHDs took steps to generate more revenue and maximize capacity. Higher LHD performance of EPHS was significantly associated with delivering more services, initiating more financial strategies, and engaging in collaboration, after adjusting for the effects of the Affordable Care Act and jurisdiction size.

Approach: A qualitative systematic review of literature on service-learning and medical education was conducted for the period between 1998 and 2012. A two-stage inclusion criteria process resulted in articles (n = 32) on service-learning and Doctor of Medicine or Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine being included for both coding and analysis.

Findings: The findings of the qualitative thematic analysis of service-learning variation in medical education identified a total of seven themes with subthemes. The themes identified from the analysis were (a) geographic location and setting, (b) program design, (c) funding, (d) participation, (e) program implementation, (f) assessment, and (g) student outcomes.

We sought a better understanding of how nonprofit hospitals are fulfilling the community health needs assessment (CHNA) provision of the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act to conduct CHNAs and develop CHNA and implementation strategies reports.Methods. Through an Internet search of an estimated 179 nonprofit hospitals in Texas conducted between December 1, 2013, and January 5, 2014, we identified and reviewed 95 CHNA and implementation strategies reports. We evaluated and scored reports with specific criteria. We analyzed hospital-related and other report characteristics to understand relationships with report quality.Results. There was wide-ranging diversity in CHNA approaches and report quality. Consultant-led CHNA processes and collaboration with local health departments were associated with higher-quality reports.Conclusions. At the time of this study, the Internal Revenue Service had not yet issued the final regulations for the CHNA requirement. This provides an opportunity to strengthen the CHNA guidance for the final regulations, clarify the purpose of the assessment and planning process and reports, and better align assessment and planning activities through a public health framework."

And yet, in opinion polls, Americans across the political spectrum repeatedly express their strong support for Medicare, alongside their disapproval of the ACA. This feature of American public opinion is often seen as a contradiction and often explained as ""incoherence,"" a mere feature of Americans' ""muddled mind."" In this article I argue that what explains this seeming contradiction is not any peculiarity of Americans' psychology but rather the grip of the corporate class on the political process and on key social institutions (e.g., mass media, judiciary), no less extraordinary today than in the past. I also argue that ordinary Americans, like millions of their counterparts in the world, would eagerly support a single-payer national health program that speaks to their interests rather than to those of the 1 percent. I will describe the ACA, compare it to Medicare, explain the concept of single payer, and conclude that the task is not to persuade presumably recalcitrant Americans to support the ACA but rather to organize a mass movement to struggle for what is right and join the rest of the world in the road toward health justice."

Pre-ACA, this fragmentation included major coverage gaps, causing significant periods of coverage interruption, especially for lower-income people. The ACA does not end the problem of churning among sources of public financing, but it does hold the potential for enabling people to move among sources of coverage rather than go without insurance. Several strategies for reducing coverage churn exist, but none is foolproof and all are in their early stages. Thus the ability of issuers to participate across multiple public financing arrangements and to offer stable provider networks becomes crucial to achieving continuity of care. Interviews with nine companies involved in developing or operating multimarket strategies confirm the feasibility of this approach while revealing major challenges, especially the challenge of finding providers willing to treat members regardless of the source of coverage. Strategies for increasing multimarket plans and networks represent one of the great areas of future policy and operational focus. © 2015 by Duke University Press."

The treatment and control of hypertension is inadequate, especially among patients without health insurance coverage. The Affordable Care Act offered an opportunity to improve hypertension management by increasing the number of people covered by insurance. This study predicts the long-term effects of improved hypertension treatment rates due to insurance expansions on the prevalence and mortality rates of CVD of nonelderly Americans with hypertension. Methods: We developed a state-transition model to simulate the lifetime health events of the population aged 25 to 64 years. We modeled the effects of insurance coverage expansions on the basis of published findings on the relationship between insurance coverage, use of antihypertensive medications, and CVD-related events and deaths. Results: The model projected that currently anticipated health insurance expansions would lead to a 5.1% increase in treatment rate among hypertensive patients. Such an increase in treatment rate is estimated to lead to 111,000 fewer new coronary heart disease events, 63,000 fewer stroke events, and 95,000 fewer CVD-related deaths by 2050. The estimated benefits were slightly greater for men than for women and were greater among nonwhite populations. Conclusion: Federal and state efforts to expand insurance coverage among nonelderly adults could yield significant health benefits in terms of CVD prevalence and mortality rates and narrow the racial/ethnic disparities in health outcomes for patients with hypertension."

Additional cuts in public coverage for children in families with incomes above 133 percent of the federal poverty level are possible if the Affordable Care Act's ""maintenance of effort"" provisions regarding Medicaid and CHIP are allowed to expire as scheduled in 2019. The potential for a significant rollback of public coverage for children raises important policy questions regarding alternative pathways to affordable and high-quality coverage for lowincome children. For many children at risk of losing eligibility for public coverage, the primary alternative pathway to coverage would be through their parents' employer-sponsored insurance, yet relatively little is known about the cost and quality of that coverage. Our estimates, based on data from the Insurance Component of the 2012 and 2013 Medical Expenditure Panel Surveys, show that many families would face sharply higher costs of covering their children. In many cases, the only employersponsored coverage available would be a high-deductible plan. © 2015 Project HOPE."

In this article I argue that this debate is irrelevant because under today's highly distorted market, prices will not be set with value considerations in mind. As an alternative, I suggest considering the ""value"" of three policy changes-Medicare's ""average sales price plus 6 percent"" payment program, laws that require insurance coverage of all new cancer drugs, and the Affordable Care Act-that are fueling manufacturers' willingness to set higher prices. More important than these issues, however, is the revolution that is occurring in molecular biology and its impact on scientists' ability to detect changes in the cancer genome. The lowered cost of discovery is driving more competitors into the market, which under distorted pricing paradoxically encourages drug makers to charge ever higher prices for their products. © 2015 Project HOPE-The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc."

We found no significant difference between the change in annual mortality rates for patients living in hospital service areas (HSAs) that experienced one or more closures and the change in rates in matched HSAs without a closure (5.5 percent to 5.2 percent versus 5.4 percent to 5.4 percent, respectively). Nor was there a significant difference in the change in all-cause mortality rates following hospitalization (9.1 percent to 8.2 percent in HSAs with a closure versus 9.0 percent to 8.4 percent in those without a closure). HSAs with a closure had a drop in readmission rates compared to controls (19.4 percent to 18.2 percent versus 18.8 percent to 18.3 percent).

Only one of the 18 articles was published in a social work journal, and 69% of the research studies were authored by one group of authors. Although implementation of the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act provides enhanced opportunities for patient navigation, the paucity of research involving social workers suggests that social work scholars and professionals are not yet well positioned to take advantage of these new opportunities.

Industries primarily employing the Mexican American population are less likely to offer employer-based health insurance.

Congress implemented the DRG system in 1983 in response to rapidly increasing health care costs. The DRG system was designed to control hospital reimbursements by replacing retrospective payments with prospective payments for hospital charges. This article explains how these payments are calculated. Every inpatient admission is classified into one of several hundred DRGs that are based on the diagnosis, complications, and comorbidities. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) assigns each DRG a weight that the CMS uses in conjunction with hospital-specific data to determine reimbursement. A population’s DRGs represent the resources needed to treat the medical disorders of that population. Hospital administrators use this information to budget and plan for the future. The Affordable Care Act and other recent legislation affect medical reimbursement by altering the DRG system. Radiologic procedures in particular are affected.

Tax-exempt hospitals are major beneficiaries of this policy because it encourages donations to the hospitals while shielding them from federal and state tax liability.

This conceptual framework also offers a basis for developing new performance metrics by which AHCs, both individually and as a group, can be held accountable, and that can inform policy decisions affecting them. This closer examination of the myriad activities of modern AHCs clarifies their essential role in our health care system and will enable these institutions to evolve, improve, be held accountable for, and more fully serve the health of the nation."

Provisions of the ACA prohibit the use of a cost-effectiveness analysis threshold and qualityadjusted life-years (QALYs) in PCORI comparative effectiveness studies, which has been understood as a prohibition on support for PCORI's conducting conventional cost-effectiveness analyses. This constraint complicates evidence-based choices where incremental improvements in outcomes are achieved at increased costs of care. How frequently this limitation inhibits efficient cost containment, also a goal of the ACA, depends on how often more effective treatment is not cost-effective relative to less effective treatment.We examined the largest database of studies of comparisons of effectiveness and cost-effectiveness to see how often there is disagreement between the more effective treatment and the cost-effective treatment, for various thresholds that may define good value. We found that under the benchmark assumption, disagreement between the two types of analyses occurs in 19 percent of cases. Disagreement is more likely to occur if a treatment intervention is musculoskeletal and less likely to occur if it is surgical or involves secondary prevention, or if the study was funded by a pharmaceutical company. © 2015 Project HOPE-The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc."

Methods: A retrospective analysis of ocular expenditure in participants of the 2007 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. Data from 20,620 unique participants aged ≥18 years were evaluated for eye care expenditure by demographic characteristics. Results: A total of 22% of the studied population had eye care expenditures in 2007. Demographic factors significantly associated with higher probability of having eye care expenditures included older age (65+ years 35%, 45-64 years 23%, <45 years 17%), female sex (female 26%, male 19%), higher educational attainment (greater than high school education 25%, less than high school education 17%), having insurance (private 24%, uninsured 13%), and visual impairment (mild 31%, none 22%). Older age, female sex, higher educational attainment, having insurance, and presence of visual impairment were also significantly associated with higher mean eye care expenditure. In those with eye care expenditure, the mean ratio between eye care and total medical expenditure was 24%, with uninsured patients spending 42% of their medical care expenditure on eye care. Conclusions: Demographic factors are associated with both the probability of having ocular expenditure and the amount of expenditure. Of all factors examined, insurance status has the most potential for modification. Policy makers should consider these numbers when devising the terms by which eye care coverage will be provided under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. © Informa Healthcare USA, Inc."

We examined the elimination of cost sharing among small business beneficiaries of Humana, a large national insurer. Study Design: This was a retrospective interrupted time series analysis of whether the change in cost-sharing policy was associated with a change in screening utilization, using grandfathered plans as a comparison group. Methods: We compared beneficiaries in small business nongrandfathered plans that were required to eliminate cost sharing (intervention) with those in grandfathered plans that did not have to change cost sharing (control). There were 63,246 men and women aged 50 to 64 years eligible for colorectal cancer screening, and 30,802 women aged 50 to 64 years eligible for breast cancer screening. The primary outcome variables were rates of colonoscopy and mammography per person-month, with secondary analysis of colonoscopy rates coded as preventive only. Results: There was no significant change in the level or slope of colonoscopy and mammography utilization for intervention plans relative to the control plans. There was also no significant relevant change among those colonoscopies coded as preventive. Conclusions: The results suggest that the implementation of the policy is not having its intended effects, as cost sharing rates for colonoscopy and mammography did not change substantially, and utilization of colonoscopy and mammography changed little, following this new policy approach."

High readmission rates may be explained by multiple events at discharge, including medication errors that occur during the transition of care from inpatient to outpatient. Pharmacist involvement at discharge has been shown to improve health outcomes in patients with chronic disease; however, there is limited knowledge regarding the benefits of a clinic appointment with a pharmacist postdischarge. OBJECTIVE: To compare hospital readmission rates and interventions in a multidisciplinary team visit coordinated by a clinical pharmacist practitioner with those conducted by a physician-only team within an internal medicine hospital follow-up program. METHODS: A retrospective observational study was completed. Patients seen between May 2012 and January 2013 in 1 of the 2 hospital followup program models (multidisciplinary team or physician-only team) were included. RESULTS: A total of 140 patient visits were included for 124 patients. Patients seen by the multidisciplinary team had a 30-day readmission rate of 14.3% compared with 34.3% by the physician-only team (P=0.010). Interventions completed during the visits, including addressing nonadherence, initiating a new medication, and discontinuing a medication were also statistically different between the groups, with the multidisciplinary team completing these interventions more frequently. CONCLUSIONS: Hospital follow-up visits coordinated by the multidisciplinary team decreased 30-day hospital readmission rates compared with follow-up visits by a physician-only team. © 2015, Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy."

This study builds on the Social Work Interest in Prevention Study (SWIPS), which evaluated extent, type, and levels of prevention content in nine social work journals from 2000 to 2005. The goal of the expanded study, the SWIPS-Expansion, was to assess whether interest in prevention increased over the years in which health reform was enacted. Of the 3,745 articles reviewed, 9.0 percent (n = 336) met the criteria for ""prevention articles."" Between 2000 and 2010, prevention articles rose from 4.1 percent to 14.3 percent of all articles.

Study design: Data for this study come from a subset of the 1842 women aged 18-39 years who responded to all four waves of a national longitudinal survey. This analysis focuses on the 892 women who had private health insurance and who used a prescription contraceptive method during any of the four study periods. Women were asked about the amount they paid out of pocket in an average month for their method of choice. Results: Between fall 2012 and spring 2014, the proportion of privately insured women paying zero dollars out of pocket for oral contraceptives increased substantially, from 15% to 67%. Similar changes occurred among privately insured women using injectable contraception, the vaginal ring and the intrauterine device. Conclusions: The implementation of the federal contraceptive coverage requirement appears to have had a notable impact on the out-of-pocket costs paid by privately insured women, and that impact has increased over time.

This study compared estimated out-of-pocket spending for care and premiums, as well as the financial burdens they impose, for the families of these adults under two simulation scenarios: obtaining coverage through a silver plan with subsidized cost sharing and enrolling in expanded Medicaid.

To understand its shortcomings, we have to understand it as part of a historic shift in the political economy of American health care. This ""neoliberal turn"" began as a reaction against the welfare state as it expanded during the New Deal and post-World War II period. What began as a movement associated with philosophers like Friedrich Hayek ultimately had a powerful impact via the attraction of powerful corporate sponsors and political supporters, and it was to historically transform American health care thought and organization. In health policy circles, for example, it can be seen in a rising emphasis on ""moral hazard,"" overuse, and cost sharing above a concern with universalism and equity. It was likewise manifested by the corporatization of the health maintenance organization and the rise of the ""consumer-driven"" health care movement. By the time of the health care reform debate, the influence of corporate ""stakeholders"" was to prove predominant. These developments, however, must be construed as connected parts of a much larger political transformation, reflected in rising inequality and privatization, occurring both domestically and internationally."

The incidence of musculoskeletal infections, including soft-tissue infections, periprosthetic joint infection, and osteomyelitis, is increasing. Cases involving both drug-resistant bacterial strains and periprosthetic joint infection in total hip and total knee arthroplasty are particularly costly and represent a growing economic burden for the American healthcare system. With the institution of the Affordable Care Act, there has been an increasing drive in the United States toward rewarding healthcare organizations for their quality of care, bundling episodes of care, and capitating approaches to managing populations. In current reimbursement models, complications following the index event, including infection, are not typically reimbursed, placing the burden of caring for infections on the physician, hospital, or accountable care organization. Without the ability to risk-stratify patient outcomes based on patient comorbidities that are associated with a higher incidence of musculoskeletal infection, healthcare organizations are disincentivized to care for moderate-to high-risk patients.

We used data from the 2013 Minnesota Health Access Survey to identify 4123 Minnesota adults aged 18 to 64 years who reported about their experiences of insurance-based discrimination. We modeled the association between discrimination and insurance type and predicted odds of having reduced access to care among those reporting discrimination, controlling for sociodemographic factors. Data were weighted to represent the state's population. Results. Reports of insurance-based discrimination were higher among uninsured (25%) and publicly insured (21%) adults than among privately insured adults (3%), which held in the regression analysis.

Our results suggest that the mandate has led to large reductions in total out-of-pocket spending on contraceptives and that these price changes are likely to be salient for women with private health insurance. © 2015 by Project HOPE-The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc."

To help address this question, we first estimate a regression model for state personal health care spending for 1991-2009, with an emphasis on the explanatory power of income, insurance, and provider market characteristics. We then use the results from this simple predictive model to produce state-level projections of health care spending for 2010-2013 to subsequently compare those average projected state values with actual national spending for 2010-2013, finding that at least 70% of the recent slowdown in health care spending can likely be explained by long-standing patterns. We also use the results from this predictive model to both examine the Great Recession's likely reduction in health care spending and project the Affordable Care Act's insurance expansion's likely increase in health care spending. © The Author(s) 2015."

Although few studies have demonstrated its efficacy in improving care for children with congenital heart disease (CHD), access to a PCMH is likely to improve CHD-patient outcomes, including global function and quality of life, while reducing healthcare costs. Recent findings To date, most patients with complex CHD have their care anchored in cardiology subspecialty-care clinics, which lack many of the attributes of a PCMH. Given that many of these patients have noncardiac morbidities, including neurocognitive impairment and multiorgan dysfunction, we believe such patients will benefit from a PCMH model of care based on primary care. Summary The PCMH based on primary care for patients with complex CHD could result in improved clinical outcomes, improved patient satisfaction and quality of life as well as decreased healthcare costs. Policy and practice reform are required to increase CHD-patient access to a PCMH, based on primary-care settings. Copyright © 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved."

As a result, the need for the medical education continuum to produce a family physician workforce that is sizable enough and highly skilled is significant. These two interdependent goals have emerged as top priorities for Family Medicine for America's Health, a new, 5-year, $21 million collaborative strategic effort of the eight US family medicine organizations to lead continued change in the US health care system. To achieve these important goals, reforms are needed across the entire educational continuum, including how we recruit, train, and help practicing family physicians refresh their skills. Such reforms must provide oppor­tunities to acquire skills needed in new practice and payment environments, to incorporate new educational standards that reflect the public's expectations of family physicians, to collaborate with our primary care colleagues to develop effective interprofessional training, and to design educational programs that are socially accountable to the patients, families, and communities we serve.

Utilization of expanded function dental auxiliaries (EFDAs) can contribute to increased workforce capacity. Iowa currently allows EFDAs to perform certain nonrestorative procedures. This study investigated dentists' willingness to use auxiliaries for restorative procedures in order inform recent discussions about expanding scope of practice for EFDAs to include such procedures. Methods This study examined responses from 677 primary care dentists who responded to the 2013 Survey of Iowa Dentists (response rate = 59 percent). The authors performed univariate and bivariate analyses (χ2 and t-tests) to examine characteristics of dentists who indicated willingness to utilize an auxiliary for newly proposed restorative functions. Results Thirty-seven percent of respondents indicated they would delegate at least one of the newly proposed restorative functions to an auxiliary. Pediatric dentists were significantly more likely to be willing to delegate (P = 0.042). Placing stainless steel crowns was most acceptable (31.9 percent of respondents), followed by amalgam restorations (22.3 percent), and composites (18.6 percent). Conclusions Many dentists are willing to delegate reversible restorative procedures. Increasing scope of practice for auxiliaries may increase capacity of the existing dental workforce and improve access for newly insured populations. Expanding scope of practice for dental auxiliaries offers a viable mechanism to rapidly increase states' dental capacity in response to rising demands for dental care, including newly insured Medicaid populations. © 2015 American Association of Public Health Dentistry."

The preelection variability in the states' implementation of these provisions coupled with the large number of states selecting their next governor made the election important at the state level. To better understand the role of health care in the recent gubernatorial elections, we analyzed health policy content presented by 71 candidates for governor on their campaign Web sites. Nearly 80% of all candidates discussed health policy on their Web site, including the subset of the 36 winning governors. The predominant focus of health policy content was on the ACA as a whole or its provisions. Medicaid was discussed more often by candidates in non-expansion states than those from expansion states. Based on the statements of winning governors, we expect serious consideration of the Medicaid expansion to occur in at least 4 states, whereas 2 states may make efforts to reverse course. Relatively few winning governors (33%) mentioned the exchanges. Only 1 expressed interest in switching from the federal exchange to a state exchange, which has particular relevance given the Supreme Court's pending decision on King v. Burwell that could invalidate tax credits on the federal exchange. The prominence of health care in the gubernatorial campaigns strengthens the likelihood that governors will play an influential role in the health system's future, especially as the ACA undergoes further federal debate. © The Author(s) 2015."

To gain insight into these effects, we analyzed data for 1999-2012 from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey to evaluate relationships between health insurance and the diagnosis and management of diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertension. People with insurance had significantly higher probabilities of diagnosis than matched uninsured people, by 14 percentage points for diabetes and hypercholesterolemia and 9 percentage points for hypertension. Among those with existing diagnoses, insurance was associated with significantly lower hemoglobin A1c (-0.58 percent), total cholesterol (-8.0 mg/dL), and systolic blood pressure (-2.9 mmHg). If the number of nonelderly Americans without health insurance were reduced by half, we estimate that there would be 1.5 million more people with a diagnosis of one or more of these chronic conditions and 659,000 fewer people with uncontrolled cases. Our findings suggest that the ACA could have significant effects on chronic disease identification and management, but policy makers need to consider the possible implications of those effects for the demand for health care services and spending for chronic disease. © 2015 Project HOPE- The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc."

In 2010, the Triple Aim became part of the US national strategy for tackling health care issues, especially in the implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) of 2010. Since that time, IHI and others have worked together to determine how the implementation of the Triple Aim has progressed. Drawing on our 7 years of experience, we describe 3 major principles that guided the organizations and communities working on this endeavor: creating the right foundation for population management, managing services at scale for the population, and establishing a learning system to drive and sustain the work over time. Context In 2008, researchers at the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) described the Triple Aim as simultaneously ""improving the individual experience of care; improving the health of populations; and reducing the per capita costs of care for populations."" IHI and its close colleagues had determined that both individual and societal changes were needed. Methods In 2007, IHI began recruiting organizations from around the world to participate in a collaborative to implement what became known as the Triple Aim. The 141 participating organizations included health care systems, hospitals, health care insurance companies, and others closely tied to health care. In addition, key groups outside the health care system were represented, such as public health agencies, social services groups, and community coalitions. This collaborative provided a structure for observational research. By noting the contrasts between the contexts and structures of those sites in the collaborative that progressed and those that did not, we were able to develop an ex post theory of what is needed for an organization or community to successfully pursue the Triple Aim. Findings Drawing on our 7 years of experience, we describe the 3 major principles that guided the organizations and communities working on the Triple Aim: creating the right foundation for population management, managing services at scale for the population, and establishing a learning system to drive and sustain the work over time. Conclusions The concept of the Triple Aim is now widely used, because of IHI's work with many organizations and also because of the adoption of the Triple Aim as part of the national strategy for US health care, developed during the implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010. Even those organizations working on the Triple Aim before IHI coined the term found our concept to be useful because it helped them think about all 3 dimensions at once and organize their work around them. © 2015 Milbank Memorial Fund."

Methods Case studies were conducted in 10 states during 2012 - which included key informant interviews and consumer focus groups - and a national survey of state CHIP program administrators was conducted in early 2013. Results Despite the recession that persisted during much of the study period, many states expanded children's coverage by raising upper income eligibility limits or by covering new groups made eligible by CHIPRA. Simplifying rules and procedures for enrollment and renewal continued to be a major priority for CHIP and Medicaid, and CHIPRA played a direct role in spurring innovation. CHIPRA's outreach grants played an important role in supporting and supplementing state outreach efforts. Important legacies of CHIPRA are the law's mandatory requirements for comprehensive dental benefits coverage and mental health parity for all types of CHIP programs. Although most states already offered generous coverage of these benefits, the mandate may have protected them from cuts during the economic downturn. Federal Maintenance of Effort rules were a crucial protection for CHIP, especially during the recession when state budget shortfalls could have led to program cuts.

Study design: This literature review was based on a comprehensive search for all literature researching rural health care provision and access in the USA. Methods: Pubmed, Proquest Allied Nursing and Health Literature, National Rural Health Association (NRHA) Resource Center and Google Scholar databases were searched using the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) 'Rural Health Services' and 'Rural Health.' MeSH subtitle headings used were 'USA,' 'utilization,' 'trends' and 'supply and distribution.' Keywords added to the search parameters were 'access,' 'rural' and 'health care.' Searches in Google Scholar employed the phrases 'health care disparities in the USA,' inequalities in 'health care in the USA,' 'health care in rural USA' and 'access to health care in rural USA.' After eliminating non-relevant articles, 34 articles were included. Results: Significant differences in health care access between rural and urban areas exist. Reluctance to seek health care in rural areas was based on cultural and financial constraints, often compounded by a scarcity of services, a lack of trained physicians, insufficient public transport, and poor availability of broadband internet services. Rural residents were found to have poorer health, with rural areas having difficulty in attracting and retaining physicians, and maintaining health services on a par with their urban counterparts. Conclusions: Rural and urban health care disparities require an ongoing program of reform with the aim to improve the provision of services, promote recruitment, training and career development of rural health care professionals, increase comprehensive health insurance coverage and engage rural residents and healthcare providers in health promotion. © 2015 The Royal Society for Public Health."

To evaluate how these changes may affect the field of radiation oncology, we evaluated the association of insurance status with the use of brachytherapy in cancers for which this treatment technique is used. Methods and Materials A total of 190,467 patients met the inclusion criteria, of whom 95,292 (50.0%) had breast cancer, 61,096 (32.1%) had prostate cancer, 28,194 (14.8%) had endometrial cancer, and 5885 (3.1%) had cervical cancer. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to determine the association between insurance status and receipt of brachytherapy among patients treated definitively for prostate and cervical cancer or postoperatively for breast and endometrial cancer. Results The rates of non-Medicaid insurance were 49.9% (cervical), 85.3% (endometrial), 87.4% (breast), and 90.9% (prostate) (P<.001). In a logistic regression, patients who received radiation therapy were less likely to receive brachytherapy if they had Medicaid coverage (odds ratio [OR] 0.57, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.53-0.61, P<.001) or did not have insurance coverage (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.45-0.56, P<.001) compared with those with non-Medicaid insurance. On subset analysis, patients with Medicaid coverage or without insurance coverage were significantly less likely to receive brachytherapy than were those with non-Medicaid insurance for all 4 sites, except for patients with endometrial cancer. Conclusions Despite being a cost-effective treatment modality, brachytherapy is less often used in the definitive or postoperative management of cancer in patients with Medicaid coverage or without insurance. Upcoming health policy changes resulting in the expansion of private insurance and Medicaid will likely increase access to and demand for brachytherapy. © 2015 Elsevier Inc."

Data registries were created to collect accurate information on patients with enough clinical information to allow for adequate risk adjustment of postoperative outcomes. Because most gynecologic procedures are elective and preference-sensitive, offering nonsurgical alternatives is an important quality measure. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), in conjunction with mandates from the Affordable Care Act, passed by Congress in 2010, has developed several initiatives centered on the concept of paying for quality care, and 1 of the first CMS initiatives began with instituting payment penalties for hospital-acquired conditions, such as catheter-associated urinary tract infections, central line-associated bloodstream infections, and surgical site infections. Registries specific to gynecology include the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology registry established in 1996; the FIBROID registry established in 1999; the Pelvic Floor Disorders Registry established by the American Urogynecologic Society in conjunction with other societies (2014); and the Society of Gynecologic Oncologists Clinical Outcomes Registry.

To identify cost-effective strategies, local health departments and other agencies need accurate information on the costs of chronic conditions in their region.Objective: To present a methodology for estimating the cost of chronic conditions for counties.Methods: Estimates of the attributable cost of 6 chronic conditions-arthritis, asthma, cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and depression-from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Chronic Disease Cost Calculator were combined with prevalence rates from the various sources and census data for California counties to estimate the number of cases and costs of each condition. The estimates were adjusted for differences in prices using Medicare geographical adjusters.Results: An estimated $98 billion is currently spent on treating chronic conditions in California. There is significant variation between counties in the percentage of total health care expenditure due to chronic conditions and county size, ranging from a low 32% to a high of 63%. The variations between counties result from differing rates of chronic conditions across age, ethnicity, and gender.Conclusions: Information on the cost of chronic conditions is important for planning prevention and control efforts. This study demonstrates a method for providing local health departments with estimates of the scope of the problems in their region. Combining the cost estimates with information on current prevention strategies can identify gaps in prevention activities and the prevention measures that promise the greatest return on investment for each county.

The implementation of the Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA) began yet another chapter in the history of this policy paradox. Methods This article explores the origin and persistence of the paradox using what many scholars call ""interpretive social science."" This methodology prioritizes history and contingency over formal theory and methods in order to present coherent and plausible narratives of events and explanations for them. These narratives are grounded in documents generated by participants in particular events, as well as conversations with them, observing them in action, and analysis of pertinent secondary sources. The methodology achieves validity and reliability by gathering information from multiple sources and making disciplined judgments about its coherence and correspondence with reality. Findings A paradox with deep historical roots persists as a result of consensus about its value for both population health and the revenue of individuals and organizations in the health sector. Participants in this consensus include leaders of governance who have disagreed about many other issues. The paradox persists because of assumptions about the burden of disease and how to address it, as well as about the effects of biomedical science that is translated into professional education, practice, and the organization of services for the prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and management of illness. Conclusions The policy paradox that has incentivized the growth and commercialization of nonprofits in the health sector since the late 19th century remains influential in health policy, especially for the allocation of resources.

To that end, we examined the value added to the population health enterprise of successful public-private partnerships (PPPs) such as those found in the Illinois Breast and Cervical Cancer Program (IBCCP), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program (NBCCEDP) in Illinois. Key Informant (KI) interviews focused on IBCCP implementation were conducted with IBCCP lead agency (LA) program coordinators (n = 35/36) in winter 2012-2013. Analysis was conducted using Atlas.ti software. The KI interviews revealed the existence of highly developed PPPs between the IBCCP LAs and individual medical providers and hospitals across Illinois. The data suggest that the small amount of funding provided by IBCCP to each LA in Illinois has been used to build and sustain robust PPPs in the majority of the IBCCP communities. The PPPs developed through the IBCCP can be seen as an unplanned benefit of CDC's investment in breast and cervical health through the NBCCEDP. While the IBCCP/NBCCEDP might be considered a â€œboutiquea categorical program which some may consider no longer necessary as individuals gain insurance under the ACA, the KI data underscore the critical role of public sector dollars, not only to serve individuals and communities directly but also to mobilize the private health care sector to act in partnership with public entities and become advocates for underserved communities. © 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc."

We aimed to identify the most and least desired resources that primary care providers want from the PCES.METHODS: A 70-question survey was administered to primary care providers (n=556) in Pennsylvania, one of four initial states chosen to develop the PCES infrastructure. Analysis focused on the highest and lowest ranked questions.RESULTS: The most desired PCES services include (1) identifying and coordinating mental health services, (2) improving office efficiency, (3) increasing overall revenues, and (4) strategies to help implement evidence-based clinical guidelines. The least desired PCES services include (1) implementing e-prescribing, (2) implementing an electronic medical record (EMR) system, (3) implementing group visits, (4) recruiting new patients, and (5) implementing open or advanced access scheduling.CONCLUSIONS: Despite expert models presented for the PCES, there is a critical need to ask primary care providers what they need from such a service. Our findings identified some divergences from key patient-centered medical home (PCMH) components, including the low ranking of services related to EMRs and increasing patient access. With interest growing in developing a PCES that would help spread innovation as outlined in the ACA, it's important to take a demand-side approach to the services providers most desire versus the more traditional supply-side approach that assumes the assistance providers need. © 2015 Society of Teachers of Family Medicine.

To anticipate challenges primary care providers may face and to inform the future role of publicly funded STI clinics, it is useful to consider their current functions. Methods Data collected by 40 STI clinics that are a part of the Sexually Transmitted Disease Surveillance Network were used to describe patient demographic and behavioral characteristics, STI diagnoses, and laboratory testing data in 2010 and 2011. Results A total of 608,536 clinic visits were made by 363,607 unique patients. Most patients (61.9%) were male; 21.9% of men reported sex with men (MSM). Roughly half of patients were 20 to 29 years old (47.1%) and non-Hispanic black (56.2%). There were 212,765 STI diagnoses (mostly nonreportable) that required clinical examinations. A high volume of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and HIV testing was performed (>350,000 tests); the prevalence was 11.5% for chlamydia, 5.8% for gonorrhea, 0.9% for HIV, and varied greatly by sex and MSM status. Among MSM with chlamydia or gonorrhea, 40.1% (1811/4448) of chlamydial and 46.2% (3370/7300) of gonococcal infections were detected at extragenital sites.

Methods Within the American College of Cardiology's PINNACLE Registry, we compared quality of coronary artery disease (CAD), heart failure, and atrial fibrillation care delivered by physicians and APPs for outpatient visits between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2012. We performed hierarchical regression adjusting for provider sex; panel size; duration of participation in registry; and patient's age, sex, insurance, number of outpatient visits, history of hypertension, diabetes, myocardial infarction, and percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass grafting in the preceding 12 months. Results We included 883 providers (716 physicians and 167 APPs) in 41 practices who cared for 459,669 patients. Mean number of patients seen by APPs (260.7) was lower compared with that seen by physicians (581.2). Compliance with most CAD, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation measures was comparable, except for a higher rate of smoking cessation screening and intervention (adjusted rate ratio: 1.14; 95% confidence interval: 1.03 to 1.26) and cardiac rehabilitation referral (rate ratio: 1.40; 95% confidence interval: 1.16 to 1.70) among CAD patients receiving care from APPs. Compliance with all eligible CAD measures was low for both (12.1% and 12.2% for APPs and physicians, respectively) with no significant difference. Results were consistent when comparing practices with both physicians and APPs (n = 41) and physician-only practices (n = 49). Conclusions Apart from minor differences, a collaborative care delivery model, using both physicians and APPs, may deliver an overall comparable quality of outpatient cardiovascular care compared with a physician-only model. © 2015 American College of Cardiology Foundation."

The extent to which public health workforce is aware of these trends has not been assessed. Objective: This research examined the extent to which the public health workforce is familiar with 8 important developments and trends in public health and explored factors associated with variation in awareness levels. Design: This study characterizes an observational cross-sectional design, based on analysis of secondary data collected by the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials through the Public Health Workforce Interests and Needs Survey (PH WINS). Setting: Our study used data from those states for which representative samples for the local health department (LHD) employees were also available. Participants: We included survey responses from employees of state health agencies' central offices and LHDs. Main Outcome Measure: The primary outcome variable for the analysis was the level of awareness about emerging public health trends in the public health workforce. Results: Awareness of emerging trends was lowest for Public Health Systems and Services Research; roughly 1 in 4 employees were aware of this trend. The second least heard of trends were Health in All Policies, and cross-jurisdictional sharing. The public health trends about which the highest proportion of public health employees had heard were implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and evidence-based public health practice. Awareness about public health trends was generally higher among state health agency employees than among LHD employees. Work environment, supervisory status, employee education, and female gender were significantly associated with higher awareness levels for both state health agency and LHD employees. Conclusions: Public health trends that are important for health agencies should be brought to the spotlight in national dialogue in order to increase practitioner involvement in those initiatives.

However, it is unknown whether their initial negative inotropic effect may increase 30-day all-cause readmission, a target outcome for Medicare cost reduction and financial penalty for hospitals under the Affordable Care Act. Methods Of the 3067 Medicare beneficiaries discharged alive from 106 Alabama hospitals (1998-2001) with a primary discharge diagnosis of heart failure and ejection fraction <45%, 2202 were not previously on beta-blocker therapy, of which 383 received new discharge prescriptions for beta-blockers. Propensity scores for beta-blocker use, estimated for each of the 2202 patients, were used to assemble a matched cohort of 380 pairs of patients receiving and not receiving beta-blockers who were balanced on 36 baseline characteristics (mean age 73 years, mean ejection fraction 27%, 45% women, 33% African American). Results Beta-blocker use was not associated with 30-day all-cause readmission (hazard ratio [HR] 0.87; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.64-1.18) or heart failure readmission (HR 0.95; 95% CI, 0.57-1.58), but was significantly associated with lower 30-day all-cause mortality (HR 0.29; 95% CI, 0.12-0.73). During 4-year postdischarge, those in the beta-blocker group had lower mortality (HR 0.81; 95% CI, 0.67-0.98) and combined outcome of all-cause mortality or all-cause readmission (HR 0.87; 95% CI, 0.74-0.97), but not with all-cause readmission (HR 0.89; 95% CI, 0.76-1.04). Conclusions Among hospitalized older patients with systolic heart failure, discharge prescription of beta-blockers was associated with lower 30-day all-cause mortality and 4-year combined death or readmission outcomes without higher 30-day readmission. © 2015 Elsevier Inc."

This study explored the impact of direct reimbursement on the provision of care management in a primary care physician organization. Methods: Using data on expenses and health plan reimbursement during the initial 16 months of care management implementation at 5 practices, we calculated the percentage of related costs that were covered by payments. Qualitative data from interviews with practice members were used to identify their perceived barriers to care management reimbursement and the impact of current reimbursement strategies on service delivery. Results: Direct reimbursement for care management covered only 21% of the costs. Reimbursement varied by care manager background, patient diagnoses, insurer, and indication for the visit. Barriers to gaining reimbursement included patient resistance to copay, clinician hesitation to bill for care management visits (for fear the patient may receive a bill), differential reimbursement policies of insurers, and general lack of reimbursement for care management in many cases. Although practice-level quality improvement incentives were an alternative means of supporting care management, because these incentives were not directly tied to the service of care management, they were used for other activities ultimately supporting patient care. Conclusions: This study highlights the need for sufficient reimbursement to initiate and maintain care management for patients in primary care as proposed for service reforms under the Affordable Care Act. © 2015, American Board of Family Medicine.

Although the Affordable Care Act (ACA) expands insurance coverage to many Americans, there are differences in availability of Medicaid coverage across states. Purpose: To understand the potential impact of Medicaid expansions on disparities in preventive care for low-income women by assessing pre-ACA breast and cervical cancer screening across states currently expanding and not expanding Medicaid to low-income adults. Methods: Data from the 2012 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (analyzed in 2014) were used to consider differences in demographics among women for whom screening is recommended, including income and race/ethnicity, across expansion and nonexpansion states. Self-reported screening was compared by state expansion status overall, for the uninsured, and for low-income women. Logistic regressions were estimated to assess differences in self-reported screening across expansion and nonexpansion states controlling for demographics. Results: Women in states that are not expanding Medicaid had signi ficantly lower odds of receiving recommended mammograms (OR=0.87, 95% CI=0.79, 0.95) or Pap tests (OR=0.87, 95% CI=0.79, 0.95). The difference was larger among the uninsured (OR=0.72, 95% CI=0.56, 0.91 for mammography; OR=0.78, 95% CI=0.65, 0.94 for Pap tests). Conclusions: As women in nonexpansion states remain uninsured and others gain coverage, existing disparities in cancer screening by race and socioeconomic status are likely to widen.

The purpose of this study was to describe physician membership in the US Congress between 2005 and 2015. Methods Congressional biographical records were searched to identify physicians who served in the US Congress from 2005 to 2015. Political and demographic characteristics of physician-members were compared with those of nonphysician-members of Congress and of all US physicians. The numbers of physicians in recent Congresses also were compared with those in each Congress since 1945. Results A total of 27 physicians representing 17 states have served in Congress since 2005. There has been a significant increase in physician representation since 1987, reaching a high of 20 members (3.7%) in the Congresses immediately following passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Physician-members were mostly men (93%) and more likely than their Congressional colleagues to be Republican (78% vs 53% of all members, P = 0.007) and from the South (63% vs 35% of all members, P = 0.003). Compared with physicians in general, physicians in Congress were more likely to be men (93% vs 70%, P = 0.009) and surgeons (26% vs 11%, P = 0.01). Conclusions Physician representation in Congress has increased substantially since 2000, potentially reflecting the greater political prominence of healthcare issues, as well as increased interest by and recruitment of physician-candidates.

The Affordable Care Act (ACA) could improve access to care for veterans, particularly if its Medicaid expansion is implemented in all states. The relationship between Medicaid expansion on the one hand and VA enrollment and utilization on the other has not previously been explored for all states. Methods: Using VA and other public data from 2002 to 2008, we calculated a measure of Medicaid eligibility sensitive to state-year varying policy change but not changes in demographics or economic conditions. Next, controlling for potential confounding factors, we estimated fixed effects Poisson models of VA enrollment and inpatient and outpatient utilization. We then used these estimates to simulate the effect of the ACA[U+05F3]s Medicaid expansion on demand for VA care. Results: If the ACA[U+05F3]s Medicaid expansion had been implemented in all states, enrollment for VA health coverage, acute inpatient care (days), and outpatient visits would have been 9%, 6%, and 12% lower, respectively. In states that did not expand Medicaid in 2014, VA enrollment, inpatient days, and outpatient visits were, respectively, 10, 6, and 13 percentage points higher than they would have been otherwise. Conclusion: VA medical centers in states that did not expand Medicaid in 2014 are likely to have experienced a higher demand, and commensurately longer wait times. As policymakers continue to address VA capacity issues, they should be mindful of the potential role of Medicaid, and that it will change over time as more states adopt the expansion. © 2015."

Although numerous factors contribute to this, disparities in access and delivery of replantation care play a substantial role. With ongoing Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act, it is prudent to understand whether expansion of coverage changes use of replantation care. Methods: The authors used the 2001 Medicaid expansion in New York State to evaluate changes in replantation for Medicaid beneficiaries and the uninsured. Data for patients having undergone replantation between 1998 and 2006 were obtained from the New York State Inpatient Database. The authors used an interrupted time series to evaluate the effect of Medicaid expansion on the probability that Medicaid beneficiaries or uninsured patients underwent replantation. Census data were used for population-adjusted case volume analysis. Results: After expansion, the likelihood of Medicaid as the primary payer for replantation increased 0.0059 percent per quarter, reaching a 1.7 percent increase 5 years after expansion. With population-based analysis, this indicates that Medicaid covered 12 additional replantation cases in New York State annually. After expansion, 11 fewer of the replantation cases in New York State each year were provided to patients without health care coverage. Conclusions: Medicaid expansion resulted in a modest but significant increase in replantation for Medicaid beneficiaries. In addition, fewer patients that underwent replantation remained uninsured. Considering the substantial cost and effort burden of replantation, these findings support the benefits of Medicaid expansion on delivery and payer coverage of replantation. © 2015 by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons."

Methods In September 2014, CMS released the first five months (August 2013 to December 2013) of data disclosing physician-industry financial relationships. The frequency and value of non-research-related transfers in radiology were calculated and compared with those for 19 other specialties. Subanalyses of the frequency and value of such transfers in radiology were performed, based on state of licensure, radiologic subspecialty, nature of payment, manufacturer identity, and drug or device involved. Results A total of 7.4% (2,654 of 35,768) of radiologists from the United States had reportable non-research-related financial relationship(s) with industry during the 5-month period, the second-lowest level among the medical specialties evaluated. The average value of non-research-related transfers of value to radiologists, excluding royalties and licenses, was low ($438.71; SD: $2,912.15; median: $43.85), with <4% of radiologists receiving >$10 per month. Of all categories, that of food and beverage had the most transfers of value (86.0%; 5,655 of 6,577); royalties and licensure were associated with the greatest average value ($27,072.34; SD: $67,524.92). Although high-value relationships were rare, 57.8% (26 of 45) of radiologists who received a value >$1,000 per month held leadership positions in imaging enterprises.

Online public reports of quality exist, but little is known about how visitors find reports or about their purpose in visiting. Objective: To address this gap, we gathered website analytics data from a national group of online public reports of hospital or physician quality and surveyed real-time visitors to those websites. Methods: Websites were recruited from a national group of online public reports of hospital or physician quality. Analytics data were gathered from each website: number of unique visitors, method of arrival for each unique visitor, and search terms resulting in visits. Depending on the website, a survey invitation was launched for unique visitors on landing pages or on pages with quality information. Survey topics included type of respondent (eg, consumer, health care professional), purpose of visit, areas of interest, website experience, and demographics. Results: There were 116,657 unique visitors to the 18 participating websites (1440 unique visitors/month per website), with most unique visitors arriving through search (63.95%, 74,606/116,657). Websites with a higher percent of traffic from search engines garnered more unique visitors (P=.001). The most common search terms were for individual hospitals (23.25%, 27,122/74,606) and website names (19.43%, 22,672/74,606); medical condition terms were uncommon (0.81%, 605/74,606). Survey view rate was 42.48% (49,560/116,657 invited) resulting in 1755 respondents (participation rate=3.6%). There were substantial proportions of consumer (48.43%, 850/1755) and health care professional respondents (31.39%, 551/1755). Across websites, proportions of consumer (21%-71%) and health care professional respondents (16%-48%) varied. Consumers were frequently interested in using the information to choose providers or assess the quality of their provider (52.7%, 225/427); the majority of those choosing a provider reported that they had used the information to do so (78%, 40/51). Health care professional (26.6%, 115/443) and consumer (20.8%, 92/442) respondents wanted cost information and consumers wanted patient narrative comments (31.5%, 139/442) on the public reports. Health care professional respondents rated the experience on the reports higher than consumers did (mean 7.2, SD 2.2 vs mean 6.2, SD 2.7; scale 0-10; P<.001). Conclusions: Report sponsors interested in increasing the influence of their reports could consider using techniques to improve search engine traffic, providing cost information and patient comments, and improving the website experience for both consumers and health care professionals."

As a result of the Affordable Care Act, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services incorporated PSS into a formula designed to determine the quality of medical care delivered to hospital inpatients; the resultant score and rank will determine subsequent hospital payments. This survey was developed to evaluate POSNA members knowledge of and experience with PSS.Methods: The POSNA Practice Management Committee developed a 14-question survey that was sent to all active and candidate members (850). A total of 229 members responded; and results were tabulated by answer and simple percentages were calculated for each question. Comments were reviewed and grouped by similarity to identify frequency.Results: A total of 82% of respondents were aware of PSS with 67% stating they were utilized in their setting. Utilization of PSS rarely alters clinical decision making. However, PSS do affect decisions regarding the patient experience; and 45% of respondents believe that PSS have utility with respect to business decisions. Fifty-nine percent of respondents feel that scores can be predictably improved. Less than half the respondents stated that they had a good or excellent understanding of PSS and only 48% believe that PSS are a valid measure of health care quality.Conclusions: POSNA members knowledge of and experience with PSS are not universal or uniform. Although most agree that patient satisfaction does not drive clinical decision making, it does appear to impact business and clinic-flow decisions with the idea that it can be predictably improved. Despite this, members self-assessed that knowledge is average and it is not clear to the members that patient satisfaction reflects medical quality. On the basis of these findings and as the impacts of PSS become more prominent, efforts to educate the members of POSNA about PSS should be enhanced. Furthermore, research to identify and develop best practices that enhance patient satisfaction and well-being while minimizing costs should be supported.Level of Evidence: Level IV. © 2014 by Lippincott Williams and Wilkins."

There are legal and ethical concerns when employers assess penalties for not completing a health risk assessment, raising questions about the voluntariness of such a program. The Departments of Treasury, Labor, and Health and Human Services' 2013 regulations for participatory programs and employers' current practices conflict with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's prevailing interpretation of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. Context In keeping with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Congress revised the law related to workplace wellness programs. In June 2013, the Departments of Treasury, Labor, and Health and Human Services passed the final regulations, updating their 2006 regulatory framework. Participatory programs that reward the completion of a health risk assessment are now the most common type of wellness program in the United States. However, legal and ethical concerns emerge when employers utilize incentives that raise questions about the voluntariness of such programs. At issue is that under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990, employers cannot require health-related inquiries and exams. Methods To analyze the current interpretation of the ADA, I conducted research on both LexisNexis and federal agency websites. The resulting article evaluates the differences in the language of Congress's enabling legislation and the federal departments' regulations and how they may conflict with the ADA. It also reviews the federal government's authority to address both the legal conflict and ethical concerns related to nonvoluntary participatory programs. Findings Employers' practices and the federal departments' regulations conflict with the current interpretation of the ADA by permitting employers to penalize employees who do not complete a health risk assessment. The departments' regulations may be interpreted as conflicting with Congress's legislation, which mentions penalties only for health-contingent wellness programs. Furthermore, the regulatory protections for employees applicable to health-contingent wellness programs do not apply to participatory programs. Conclusions Either Congress or the federal agencies should address the conflict among employers' practices, the wellness regulations, and the ADA and also consider additional protections for employees. Employers can avoid ethical and legal complications by offering voluntary programs with positive incentives. © 2015 Milbank Memorial Fund."

EuroQOL-5D (EQ-5D) and Short Form-6D (SF-6D) are commonly used quality-of-life instruments. Domains in the EQ-5D questionnaire are thought to be less responsive in measuring quality of life after cervical surgery. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the validity and responsiveness of SF-6D and EQ-5D in determining health and quality of life after elective cervical spine surgery. METHODS: A total of 420 patients undergoing elective cervical spine surgery over a period of 2 years were enrolled in a prospective longitudinal registry. Patient-reported outcomes Neck Disability Index (NDI), EQ-5D, and SF-12 were recorded. Based on previously published equations, SF-6D was calculated using NDI and SF-12 scores. Patients were asked whether ""surgery met their expectations"" (meaningful improvement). The validity and relative responsiveness of SF-6D (NDI), SF-6D (SF-12), and EQ-5D to discriminate between meaningful and nonmeaningful improvement were calculated. RESULTS: Sixty-six percent of patients (277) reported a level of improvement after surgery that met their expectations (meaningful improvement). SF-6D (NDI) (area under the curve [AUC] 0.69) was a more valid discriminator of meaningful improvement compared with the SF-6D (SF-12) (AUC 0.65) and EQ-5D (AUC 0.62). SF-6D (NDI) was also a more responsive measure compared with SF-6D (SF-12) and EQ-5D (standardized response mean difference: 0.66, 0.48, and 0.44, respectively). CONCLUSION: SF-6D is a more valid and responsive measure of general health and quality of life compared with EQ-5D. SF-6D derived from disease-specific disability scores was more valid and responsive than that derived from the generic preference-based SF-12. Cost-effective studies should use SF-6D as a measure of QALY after cervical spine surgery.

There is speculation that this increase in the number of insured could make accessing health care services more difficult. Those who are unable to access care in a timely manner may use the Internet to search for information needed to answer their health questions. Objective: The aim was to determine whether difficulty accessing health care services for reasons unrelated to insurance coverage is associated with increased use of the Internet to obtain health information. Methods: Survey data from 32,139 adults in the 2011 National Health Interview Study (NHIS) were used in this study. The exposure for this analysis was reporting difficulty accessing health care services or delaying getting care for a reason unrelated to insurance status. To define this exposure, we examined 8 questions that asked whether different access problems occurred during the previous 12 months. The outcome for this analysis, health information technology (HIT) use, was captured by examining 2 questions that asked survey respondents if they used an online health chat room or searched the Internet to obtain health information in the previous 12 months. Several multinomial logistic regressions estimating the odds of using HIT for each reported access difficulty were conducted to accomplish the study objective. Results: Of a survey population of 32,139 adults, more than 15.90% (n=5109) reported experiencing at least one access to care barrier, whereas 3.63% (1168/32,139) reported using online health chat rooms and 43.55% (13,997/32,139) reported searching the Internet for health information. Adults who reported difficulty accessing health care services for reasons unrelated to their health insurance coverage had greater odds of using the Internet to obtain health information. Those who reported delaying getting care because they could not get an appointment soon enough (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.9-2.5), were told the doctor would not accept them as a new patient or accept their insurance (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.7-2.5 and OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.7-2.5, respectively), or because the doctor's office was not open when they could go (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.9-2.7) had more than twice the odds of using the Internet to obtain health information compared to those who did not report such access difficulties. Conclusions: People experiencing trouble accessing health care services for reasons unrelated to their insurance status are more likely to report using the Internet to obtain health information.

This law aims to encourage 'productive' forms of competition by increasing the proportion of premium dollars spent on clinical benefits. To date, very little is known about the performance of firms in the individual health insurance market, including how MLRs are related to insurer and market characteristics. The MLR comprises one component of the price-cost margin, a traditional gauge of market power; the other component is percent of premiums spent on administrative expenses. We use data from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (2001-2009) to evaluate whether the MLR is a good target measure for regulation by comparing the two components of the price-cost margin between markets that are more competitive versus those that are not, accounting for firm and market characteristics. We find that insurers with monopoly power have lower MLRs. Moreover, we find no evidence suggesting that insurers' administrative expenses are lower in more concentrated insurance markets. Thus, our results are largely consistent with the interpretation that the MLR could serve as a target measure of market power in regulating the individual market for health insurance but with notable limited ability to capture product and firm heterogeneity.

How has this happened? The answer is rooted in three political variables: interest groups, political culture, and American federalism. First, interestgroup support (from hospitals, nursing homes, and insurers) is more influential than the fragmented group opposition (from underpaid officebased physicians). Second, Medicaid provides a partial counterweight to conservative charges of a federal health care takeover because of the states' roles in administering the program. Third, Medicaid's intergovernmental fiscal partnership creates financial incentives for state and federal officials to expand enrollment-expansions that these policy makers often favor, given the program's increasingly important role in the nation's health care system. This institutional dynamic is here called catalytic federalism. © 2015 by Project HOPE-The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc."

Similarly, the cost of medical insurance products will not be included as these issues cannot be directly addressed by physician behavior. The body of this discussion will focus on costs directly experienced by, or potentially controlled by physicians. These areas include: Practice expense and margin; hospital direct costs and margin.

It is unclear if payment models intended to improve health care efficiency, such as the Medicare accountable care organization (ACO) programs, discourage the provision of low-value services. OBJECTIVE To assess whether the first year of the Medicare Pioneer ACO program was associated with a reduction in use of low-value services. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In a difference-in-differences analysis,we compared use of low-value services between Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries attributed to health care provider groups that entered the Pioneer program (ACO group) and beneficiaries attributed to other health care providers (control group) before (2009-2011) vs after (2012) Pioneer ACO contracts began. Data analysis was conducted from December 1, 2014, to June 27, 2015. Comparisons were adjusted for beneficiaries' sociodemographic and clinical characteristics as well as for geography.We decomposed estimates according to service characteristics (clinical category, price, and sensitivity to patient preferences) and compared estimates between subgroups of ACOs with higher vs lower baseline use of low-value services. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Use of, and spending on, 31 services in instances that provide minimal clinical benefit, measured as annual service counts per 100 beneficiaries and price-standardized annual service spending per 100 beneficiaries. RESULTS During the precontract period, trends in the use of low-value services were similar for the ACO and control groups. The first year of ACO contracts was associated with a differential reduction (95%CI) of 0.8 low-value services per 100 beneficiaries for the ACO group (1.2 to 0.4; P .001), corresponding to a 1.9%differential reduction in service quantity (2.9%to 0.9%) and a 4.5%differential reduction in spending on low-value services (7.5%to 1.4%; P = .004). Differential reductions were similar for services less sensitive vs more sensitive to patient preferences and for higher- vs lower-priced services. The ACOs with higher than their markets' mean baseline levels of low-value service use experienced greater service reductions (1.2 services per 100 beneficiaries; 1.7 to 0.7; P .001) than did ACOs with use below the mean (0.2 services per 100 beneficiaries, 0.6 to 0.2; P = .41; P = .003 for test of difference between subgroups). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE During its first year, the Pioneer ACO program was associated with modest reductions in low-value services, with greater reductions for organizations providing more low-value care. Accountable care organization-like risk contracts may be able to discourage use of low-value services even without specifying services to target. Copyright © 2015 American Medical Association.

Despite their potential to contribute to comprehensive patient care, no prior studies have investigated the prevalence of community gardens affiliated with US healthcare institutions, and the demographic characteristics of communities served by these gardens. Methods: In 2013, national community garden databases, scientific abstracts, and public search engines (e.g., Google Scholar) were used to identify gardens. Outcomes included the prevalence of hospital-based community gardens by US regions, and demographic characteristics (age, race/ethnicity, education, household income, and obesity rates) of communities served by gardens. Results: There were 110 healthcare-based gardens, with 39 in the Midwest, 25 in the South, 24 in the Northeast, and 22 in the West. Compared to US population averages, communities served by healthcare-based gardens had similar demographic characteristics, but significantly lower rates of obesity (27% versus 34%, P<. .001). Conclusions: Healthcare-based gardens are located in regions that are demographically representative of the US population, and are associated with lower rates of obesity in communities they serve. © 2014."

When it is mentioned at all, the possibility of regulating the medical industry as a public utility is brusquely dismissed as anathema to the American regulatory tradition. This dismissiveness, however, rests on a failure to appreciate just how deeply the public utility model shaped health law in the twentieth century— and how it continues to shape health law today. Closer economic regulation of the medical industry may or may not be prudent, but it is by no means incompatible with our governing institutions and political culture. Indeed, the durability of such regulation suggests that the modern embrace of marketbased approaches in the medical industry may be more ephemeral than it seems. © 2015, Michigan Law Review Association.

Lack of insurance may partly explain this disparity. The objective of this study was to identify associations between insurance status and both advanced-stage cancer and cancer-specific mortality. METHODS Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) 18 registries, 57,981 patients ages 15 to 39 years were identified who were diagnosed between 2007 and 2010 and had complete insurance and staging information. Multinomial logistic regression models were used to identify associations between insurance type and disease stage, with the models adjusted for sex, age, and race. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate cancer-specific mortality. RESULTS Overall, 84% of patients were aged ≥25 years, 64% were women, and 79% were privately insured. Compared with patients who had private insurance, those who had nonprivate insurance tended to present with more advanced-stage disease and to die more quickly and more commonly from their cancer. Patients ages 25 to 39 years who had Medicaid coverage or no insurance had 3.2 times and 2.4 times higher odds of having stage IV disease, respectively, than privately insured patients (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.0-3.5 times higher odds and 2.1-2.6 times higher odds, respectively). Among those with stage I/II and III/IV cancers, the risk of death was 2.9 times greater (95% CI, 2.2-3.9 times greater) and 1.7 times greater (95% CI, 1.5-1.9 times greater), respectively, than the risk for privately insured patients. Patients who died from stage III/IV cancers survived at least 2 months longer if they had private insurance. CONCLUSIONS Among young adults, insurance status is independently associated with advanced-stage cancer and the risk of death from cancer, even for patients who have low-stage disease. Broader insurance coverage and access to health care may improve some of the disparate outcomes of adolescents and young adults with cancer. © 2014 American Cancer Society."

Currently, the predominant form of reimbursement is the form of a fee-for-service system in which surgeons are reimbursed for each discrete unit of care provided. This system does factor the cost, quality, or outcomes of service provided. For the purposes of cost containment, the bundled episode reimbursement has gained popularity as a potential alternative to the current feefor-service system. In the newer model, the spinal surgeon will become increasingly responsible for controlling costs. The bundled payment system will initially offer financial incentives to initiate a meaning-ful national transition from the fee-for-service model. The difficulty will be ensuring that the services of surgeons continue to be valued past this initiation period. However, greater financial responsibilities will be placed upon the individual surgeon in this new system. Over time, the evolving interests of hospital systems could result in the devaluation of the surgeons' services. Significant cooperation on behalf of all involved healthcare providers will be necessary to ensure that quality of care does not suffer while efforts for cost containment continue. © 2015 Baishideng Publishing Group Inc."

Women in Canada experienced better care, particularly as compared with women who were inadequately insured in the United States. Women in Canada were diagnosed earlier (rate ratio [RR]=1.12) and enjoyed better access to breast conserving surgery (RR=1.48), radiation (RR=1.60), and hormone therapies (RR=1.78). Women living in high-poverty Canadian neighborhoods even experienced shorter waits for surgery (RR=0.58) and radiation therapy (RR=0.44) than did such women in the United States. Consequently, women in Canada were much more likely to survive longer. Regression analyses indicated that health insurance could explain most of the better care and better outcomes in Canada. Over this study's 15-year time frame 31,500 late diagnoses, 94,500 suboptimum treatment plans, and 103,500 early deaths were estimated in high-poverty U.S. neighborhoods due to relatively inadequate health insurance coverage.

Risk factors analyzed included sex, race/ethnicity, follow-up status, age, BMI, systolic blood pressure, body temperature and pulse rate. Records for 2191 low-income patients (µ age = 44.5 years; 72.5% female; 10.1% African American, 26.2% Hispanic, 63.7% White) from a central Texas acute health and primary care facility.RESULTS: The amount of time that passed between a patent's initial hospital encounter and a follow-up visit had an effect in predicting both 60-day (OR = 1.055) and 90-day (OR = 1.088) hospital readmission. Patient race/ethnicity had an effect in predicting 90-day readmission. Hispanic patients had a lower likelihood of being readmitted after 90 days than being readmitted after 30 days as compared with White, non-Hispanic patients (OR = 0.688).CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that risk factors identified at 30 days are similar to those at 60 and 90 days, with the exception of follow-up status and race/ethnicity."

The focus is on Consumers Union's Consumer Reports and the American Medical Association's lay health magazine, Hygeia. Findings from Consumer Reports show that the consumer movement of the 1930s-40s staunchly advocated for universal health insurance. Whereas consumer rights language nowadays tends towards individual choice and personal responsibility, consumerism in health care during that era articulated ideas about consumer citizenship, framing choice and responsibility in collectivist terms and health care as a social good. This paper also illuminates the limits and weaknesses of a central tenet in consumerism-freedom of choice-by analyzing stories in Hygeia about the doctor-patient relationship. A textual analysis finds that the AMA's justification in the 1930s-40s against socialized medicine, i.e., the freedom to choose a doctor, was in practice highly controlled by the medical profession. Findings show that long before the rhetoric of the ""empowered consumer"" became popular, some patients exercised some choice even in an era when physicians achieved total professional dominance. But these patients were few and tend to occupy the upper socioeconomic strata of US society. In reality choice was an illusion in a fee-for-service era when most American families could not afford the costs of medical care. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd."

Fragmentation, inefficiency, and low-quality care have been long standing issues for this population. The objective of this study was to conduct an early evaluation of an innovative program that coordinates benefits for elderly dual eligibles. Study Design: Longitudinal cohort study. Methods: Comparable sources of administrative claims from 2007 to 2009 were used to examine differences in 30-day rehospitalization between dual eligibles in Massachusetts participating in Senior Care Options (SCO), an integrated managed care program, and dual eligibles in Medicare fee-for-service. Multivariable logistic regression models with county and time fixed effects were used for estimation. Results: We found no statistically significant effect of SCO on rehospitalization, an area where coordinated care would be expected to make a substantial difference. Conclusions: Our results suggest that coordinating the financingand delivery of services through an integrated managed program may not sufficiently address the problems of inefficiency and fragmentation in care for hospitalized dual eligible enrollees."

Methods: State Emergency Department Database for Iowa was used for 2012, which comprised of all outpatient ED visits in the state. Logistic regression was used for bivariate and multivariable analyses to model the odds of visiting the ED for NTDCs, relative to other conditions, and odds of visiting the ED multiple times relative to a single time in 2012 for NTDCs. The hospital charges associated with the NTDC ED visits were also examined. Results: ED visits for NTDCs comprised 1.41% of all ED visits in Iowa during 2012 with a mean charge of $557. Of the patients presenting for NTDCs in 2012, 17% presented multiples times. Young adults, Medicaid enrollees or uninsured, and those residing in metropolitan areas had greater odds of presenting to the EDs for NTDCs compared with other conditions, and presenting multiple times to EDs for NTDCs.

Design Retrospective data review using data acquired from a publicly available electronic database. Methods A database was downloaded from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services website under Identified General Payments to Physicians and a primary specialty of ophthalmology. Basic statistical analysis was performed including mean, median, and range of payments for both single payments and per provider. Main Outcome Measures Data summary by category of payment and geographic region and comparison with other surgical subspecialties. Results From August 1, 2013, through December 31, 2013, a total of 55 996 individual payments were reported to 9855 ophthalmologists for a total of $10 926 447. The mean amount received in a single payment was $195.13 (range, $0.04-$193 073). The mean amount received per physician identifier (ID) was $1108 (range, $1-$397 849), and the median amount was $112.01. Consulting fees made up the largest percentage of fees. There was not a large difference in payments received by region. The mean payments for the subspecialties of dermatology, neurosurgery, orthopedic surgery, and urology ranged from $954 to $6980, and median payments in each field by physician ID ranged from $88 to $173. Conclusions A large amount of data were released by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for the Physician Payment Sunshine Act. In ophthalmology, mean and median payments per physician did not vary greatly from other surgical subspecialties. Most single payments were less than $100, and most physicians received less than $500 in total payments. Payments for consulting made up the largest category of spending.

Well-designed, comprehensive workplace wellness programs have the potential to improve cardiovascular health and to reduce mortality, morbidity, and disability resulting from cardiovascular disease and stroke. Nevertheless, widespread implementation of comprehensive workplace wellness programs is lacking, and program composition and quality vary. Several organizations provide worksite wellness recognition programs; however, there is variation in recognition criteria, and they do not specifically focus on cardiovascular disease and stroke prevention. Although there is limited evidence to suggest that company performance on employer health management scorecards is associated with favorable healthcare cost trends, these data are not currently robust, and further evaluation is needed.

Or will their potential market power lead to higher prices and lower quality? ACOs appear in various forms and structures with financial and clinical integration at their core; however, the tools to assess their quality and the incentive structures that will determine their success are still evolving. Both market forces and regulatory structures will determine how these outcomes emerge. This introduction reviews the evidence presented in this special issue to tackle this thorny trade-off. In general the evidence is promising, but the full potential of ACOs to improve the health care delivery system is still uncertain. This introductory review concludes that the current consensus is to letACOs grow, anticipating that they will make a contribution to improve our poor-quality and high-cost delivery system. © 2015 by Duke University Press."

As our nation's unprecedented health care reform unfolds, it is becoming clear that rural communities have unique strengths, and capitalizing on these strengths can position them well for this health care transformation. Equally important are the distinct challenges that--with careful planning, attention, and resources--can be transformed into opportunities to thrive in the new health care environment. The North Carolina Institute of Medicine's Task Force on Rural Health recently published a report that highlights the strengths and challenges of rural communities [1]. In order to fully leverage these opportunities, we must continue to acknowledge the fundamental importance of access to basic health care, while also broadening our discussion to collectively tackle the additional components necessary to create healthy, thriving rural communities. As we reexamine the needs of rural communities, we should broaden our discussions to include an expansion of the types of access that are necessary for strengthening rural health. Collaboration, successful recruitment and retention, availability of specialty services, quality care, and cost effectiveness are some of the issues that must come into discussions about access to services. With this in mind, this issue of the NCMJ explores opportunities to strengthen the health of North Carolina's rural communities."

Formed in 1964, the ACIP was charged with this role. The committee has undergone significant changes in structure and operational activities during its 50-year history. The ACIP works closely with many liaison organizations to develop its immunization recommendations, which are harmonized among key professional medical societies. ACIP vaccine recommendations form two immunization schedules, which are updated annually: (1) the childhood and adolescent immunization schedule and (2) the adult immunization schedule. Today, once ACIP recommendations are adopted by the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, these recommendations are published in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR), become official policy, and are incorporated into the appropriate immunization schedule. © 2014."

Although the substantial body of work on policy creation provides tentative explanations, we believe repeals represent an alternative way of examining the effects of congressional organization on legislative behavior. In this paper, we develop hypotheses based on both the conditional nature of party power and the location of pivot points, and test these hypotheses with a new data set of repeals from 1877 to 2012. We find that the largest effects on Congress’s capacity to repeal legislation are variation in the majority’s positive agenda control and shifts in the gridlock interval. We also find that when the majority claims control of both chambers after a long stretch in the minority, there is an increased likelihood of repeal beyond what is predicted by conditional party government alone. Because the partisan factors in our model have the largest substantive effects, and because repeals do not occur automatically in productive Congresses, we characterize repeals as long-term contests between two great “teams” over the location of the status quo. © 2015, © 2015 University of Utah."

We sought to identify people living with HIV/AIDS from Medicare and Medicaid claims data to estimate Medicaid costs for treating HIV/AIDS in California. We also examined how alternate methods of identifying the relevant sample affect estimates of per capita costs.Methods. We analyzed data on Californians enrolled in Medicaid with an HIV/AIDS diagnosis reported in 2007 Medicare or Medicaid claims data. We compared alternative selection criteria by examining use of antiretroviral drugs, HIV-specific monitoring tests, and medical costs. We compared the final sample and average costs with other estimates of the size of California's HIV/AIDS population covered by Medicaid in 2007 and their average treatment costs.Results. Eighty-seven percent (18 290) of potentially identifiable HIV-positive individuals satisfied at least 1 confirmation criterion. Nearly 80% of confirmed observations had claims for HIV-specific tests, compared with only 3% of excluded cases. Female Medicaid recipients were particularly likely to be miscoded as having HIV. Medicaid treatment spending for Californians with HIV averaged $33 720 in 2007.Conclusions. The proposed algorithm displays good internal and external validity. Accurately identifying HIV cases in claims data is important to avoid drawing biased conclusions and is necessary in setting appropriate HIV managed-care capitation rates."

Methods Data were from the National Survey of Children with Special Health Care Needs (NS-CSHCN), a random-digit telephone survey with 40,243 (2009-2010) and 38,866 (2001) completed interviews. Consistency and adequacy of insurance was measured by: 1) coverage status, 2) gaps in coverage, 3) coverage of needed services, 4) reasonableness of uncovered costs, and 5) ability to see needed providers, as reported by parents. Bivariate and multivariable analyses were conducted to assess factors associated with adequate insurance coverage in 2009-2010. Unadjusted and adjusted prevalence estimates were examined to identify changes in the type of insurance coverage and the proportion of CSHCN with adequate coverage by insurance type. Results The proportion of CSHCN with private coverage decreased from 64.7% to 50.7% between 2001 and 2009-2010, while public coverage increased from 21.7% to 34.7%; the proportion of CSHCN without any insurance declined from 5.2% to 3.5%. The proportion of CSHCN with adequate coverage varied over time and by insurance type: among privately covered CSHCN, the proportion with adequate coverage declined (62.6% to 59.6%), while among publicly covered CSHCN, the proportion with adequate insurance increased (63.0% to 70.7%). Publicly insured CSHCN experienced improvements in each of the 3 adequacy components. Conclusions There has been a continued shift from private to public coverage, which is more affordable, offers benefits that are more likely to meet CSHCN needs, and allowed CSHCN to see necessary providers."

Results from a logistic regression model demonstrated that participating dentists scored significantly higher in altruistic attitudes and perceived problems with Medicaid as less important.Conclusions: Dentists who accepted Medicaid-enrolled patients had significantly more positive attitudes about Medicaid administration and altruistic attitudes in general. Investigators in future studies should examine how these attitudes are shaped by educational and professional experiences.Practical Implications: Dentists' perceptions about Medicaid potentially are modifiable by changing program policies in ways to improve access for vulnerable populations, including new Medicaid enrollees.

Although a number of individual institutions have made great strides toward more effective and efficient care, progress has not gone far enough on a national scale. Barriers to quality of care lie in fundamental, systemwide factors that impede large-scale change. Notable among these is the third-party financing arrangement that dominates the healthcare system. Long-term goals for healthcare reform should address this barrier to higher quality of care.Anew model for healthcare financing that includes patient awareness of the cost of care will encourage better quality and reduced spending by engaging patients in the pursuit of value, aligning incentives for insurers to reduce costs with patients' desire to receive excellent care, and holding providers accountable for the quality and cost of the care they provide. Several new programs implemented under the Patient Protection andAffordableCare Act aim to catalyze improvement in the quality of care, but the law takes thewrong approach, directing incentives at providers only andmaintaining a system that excludes patients from the search for high-value care. © 2015 The Southern Medical Association."

As a result of budget constraints, California Medicaid eliminated its comprehensive adult dental coverage in July 2009. We examined the impact of this policy change on emergency department (ED) visits by Medicaid-enrolled adults for dental problems in the period 2006-11. We found that the policy change led to a significant and immediate increase in dental ED use, amounting to more than 1,800 additional dental ED visits per year. Young adults, members of racial/ ethnic minority groups, and urban residents were disproportionately affected by the policy change. Average yearly costs associated with dental ED visits increased by 68 percent. The California experience provides evidence that eliminating Medicaid adult dental benefits shifts dental care to costly EDs that do not provide definitive dental care. The population affected by the Medicaid adult dental coverage policy is increasing as many states expand their Medicaid programs under the ACA. Hence, such evidence is critical to inform decisions regarding adult dental coverage for existing Medicaid enrollees and expansion populations. © 2015 Project HOPE-The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc."

To review guidance from professional medical associations to physicians on the Sunshine Act, with a focus on industry support for medical publications. Methods. Using ‘Sunshine Act’ as a search term, we searched PubMed (dates February 2013 to November 2014) and the ‘grey literature’ using Google and Google Scholar. Online information was extracted from websites of pre-identified professional medical associations. Results. Some professional medical associations have published peer-reviewed recommendations, position statements or general advice on their websites and in journals around the Sunshine Act. Associations also provided broad online educational resources for physicians. There was universal agreement between peer-reviewed publications, including guidelines, for the need for full transparency and disclosure of industry support. Surveys by some professional associations showed variance in opinion on the forecasted impact of the Sunshine Act on physician–industry relationships. There was scarce information specifically related to reporting requirements for industry-supported medical publications. Conclusions. There is a shortage of information for physicians from professional associations regarding the Sunshine Act and support for medical publications. Due to the lack of clear guidance regarding support for publications, there are presently varying interpretations of the Sunshine Act. The literature debates the potential impact of the Sunshine Act and expresses some concerns that physician-enabled innovation in drug development may be hindered. © 2015 Informa UK Ltd."

Purpose: To estimate the willingness-to-pay for specific attributes of rural health care facilities in rural Kentucky to determine which services and operational characteristics are most valued by rural residents. Methodology: We fitted choice experiment data from 769 respondents in 10 rural Kentucky counties to a conditional logit model and used the results to estimate willingness-to-pay for attributes in several categories, including hours open, types of insurance accepted, and availability of health care professionals and specialized care. Findings: Acceptance of Medicaid/Medicare with use of a sliding fee scale versus acceptance of only private insurance was the most valued attribute. Presence of full diagnostic services, an emergency room, and 24-hour/7-day-per-week access were also highly valued. Conversely, the presence of specialized care, such as physical therapy, cancer care, or dialysis, was not valued. In total, respondents were willing to pay $225 more annually to support a hospital relative to a rural health clinic. Conclusion: Rural Kentuckians value the services, convenience, and security that rural hospitals offer, though they are not willing to pay more for specialized care that may be available in larger medical treatment centers. The results also inform which attributes might be added to existing rural health facilities to make them more valuable to local residents. © 2014 National Rural Health Association."

Although this consolidation could result in improved patient care, the resulting increase in market concentration also could allow larger groups to negotiate higher physician fees from private insurers. We examined the association between market concentration and physician fees in the case of total knee arthroplasty by calculating market concentration for orthopedic groups practicing in a given market and by analyzing administrative claims data from Marketscan. In the period 2001-10 the average professional fee for total knee arthroplasty was $2,537. During this time, in markets that moved from the bottom quartile of concentration to the top quartile, physician fees paid by private payers increased by $168 per procedure. The increase nearly offset the $261 decline in fees that we observed, absent changes in market concentration. These findings suggest that caution should be used in implementing policies designed to encourage further group concentration, which could produce similar effects. © 2015 Project HOPE - The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc."

Older adults must contend today with increasing burden over the life course often as the result of life-limiting chronic pain and chronic illnesses as well as social and economic factors beyond their control. These burdens are frequently shared with unpaid family caregivers who provide significant uncompensated medical care and social support to their loved ones. Enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, recognized as a fundamental human right under international law, remains a goal for all older adults and encompasses the right to palliative care. For many older Americans, especially vulnerable subgroups who face health and pain disparities, however, this goal remains elusive. A public health strategy for implementing palliative care policy interventions will help to build agefriendly environments, assure the availability and accessibility of palliative systems of care, essential medicines, and an adequate generalist-level workforce, and sustain diffusion of innovation across all levels of health and social provision. The 2015 White House Conference on Aging must make these realignments a policy priority in order to foster social and economic development for all older Americans. © The Author 2015."

Although this idea may have merit, significant legal and other barriers stand in the way of allowing dentists to do more primary health care, physicians to do more oral health care, and both professions to collaborate. State practice acts, standards of care, and professional school curricula all support the historical separation between the 2 professions. Current laws do not contemplate working across professional boundaries, leaving providers who try vulnerable to legal penalties. Here we examine the legal, regulatory, and training barriers to dental andmedical professionals performing services outside their traditional scope of practice."

Built on concepts originating from HMOs and then Medicare Advantage plans, ACOs provide incentives based on total cost of care rather than any individual provider's cost. Early quality and cost results are mixed, and, more importantly, so is physician response. The ACO program still has potential to be a bright spot for the future of healthcare, but until there is widespread physician engagement, achieving the triple aim is likely to remain elusive.

Spine surgery may be well suited for bundled payments because of clearly defined episodes of care, but the impact on current practice has not been studied. We sought to examine how a theoretical bundled payment strategy with financial disincentives to resource utilization would impact practice patterns. Methods A multiple-choice survey was administered to spine surgeons describing eight clinical scenarios. Respondents were asked about their current practice, and then their practice in a hypothetical bundled payment system. Respondents could choose from multiple types of implants, bone grafts, and other resources utilized at the surgeon's discretion. Results Forty-three respondents completed the survey. Within each scenario, 24%-49% of respondents changed at least one aspect of management. The proportion of cases performed without implants was unchanged for four scenarios and increased in four by an average of 8%. Use of autologous iliac crest bone graft increased across all scenarios by an average of 18%. Use of neuromonitoring decreased in all scenarios by an average of 21%. Differences in costs were not statistically significant. Conclusions Financial disincentives to resource utilization may result in some changes to surgeons' practices but these appear limited to items with less clear benefits to patients. Choices of implants, which account for the majority of intraoperative costs, did not change meaningfully. A bundling strategy targeting peri-operative costs solely related to surgical practice may not yield substantive savings while rationing potentially beneficial treatments to patient care.

The marketplace uses an active purchaser model, which means that Covered California can selectively contract with some health plans and exclude others. During the 2014 open-enrollment period, it enrolled 1.3 million people, who are covered by eleven health plans. We describe the market shares of health plans in California and in each of the nineteen rating regions. We examine the empirical relationship between measures of provider market concentration-spanning health plans, hospitals, and medical groups-and rating region premiums. To do this, we analyze premiums for silver and bronze plans for specific age groups. We find both medical group concentration and hospital concentration to be positively associated with premiums, while health plan concentration is not statistically significant.We simulate the impact of reducing hospital concentration to levels that would exist in moderately competitive markets. This produces a predicted overall premium reduction of more than 2 percent. However, in three of the nineteen rating regions, the predicted premium reduction was more than 10 percent. These results suggest the importance of provider market concentration on premiums."

Aims: The aim of this study was to examine gender differences in suicidal ideation of probationers. Method: Using a national sample of 3,014 male and 1,306 female probationers with data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (2009-2011), multivariate regression analysis was conducted. Results: Male and female probationers display similar demographic characteristics although their life circumstances and experiences seem different. Female probationers in the study were more likely to experience financial, psychological, and residential stressors than male probationers were. Female probationers were also more likely to have received medical and/or psychiatric treatments. Female probationers were exposed to more suicidal ideation risks than male probationers were. Additionally, no protective factors to suicidal ideation were found for female probationers. Conclusion: The findings suggest that a gender-specific approach to suicidal ideation of probationers may lessen the prevalence of suicidal ideation of this largely neglected population. © 2015 Hogrefe Publishing."

Low birth weight (LBW) is associated with infant morbidity and mortality. This is the first study of LBW in Kansas using vital statistics to determine maternal and health care system factors associated with LBW. Outcomes. Low birth weight. Objective. Determine if prenatal care, maternal socio- demographic or medical factors, or insurance status were associated with LBW. Methods. Birth certificate data were merged with Medicaid eligibility data and subjected to logistic regression analysis. Results. Of the 37,081 single vaginal births, LBW rates were 5.5% overall, 10.8% for African Americans, and 5% for White Americans. Lacking private insurance was associated with 34% more LBW infants (AOR 1.34; 95% CI 1.13–1.58), increased comorbidity, and late or less prenatal care. Low birth weight was associated with maternal medical comorbidity and with previous adverse birth outcomes. Conclusions. Insurance status, prenatal care, and maternal health during pregnancy are associated with LBW. Private insurance was consistently associated with more prenatal care and better outcomes.

This study aimed to assess the impact of PCMH curricular innovations on the KSA of Internal Medicine residents. Methods: Twenty four (24) Internal Medicine residents-12 Traditional (TR) track residents and 12 Teaching Health Center (THC) track residents-began training in Academic Year (AY) 2011 at the Wright Center for Graduate Medical Education (WCGME). They were followed through AY2013, covering three years of training. PCMH curricular innovations were focally applied July 2011 until May 2012 to THC residents. These curricular innovations were spread program-wide in May 2012. Semi-annual, validated PCMH Clinician Assessments assessing KSA were started in AY2011 and were completed by all residents. Results: Mean KSA scores of TR residents were similar to those of THC residents at baseline for all PCMH competencies. In May 2012, mean scores of THC residents were significantly higher than TR residents for most KSA. After program-wide implementation of PCMH innovations, mean scores of TR residents for all KSA improved and most became equalized to those of THC residents. Globally improved KSA scores of THC and TR residents were maintained through May 2014, with the majority of improvements above baseline and reaching statistical significance. Conclusions: PCMH curricular innovations inspired by Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA's) Teaching Health Center funded residency program expansion quickly and consistently improved the KSA of Internal Medicine residents. © 2015 Thomas-Hemak et al."

Study Design. Retrospective cross-sectional database analysis. Setting. Open Payments program database recently released by Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Subjects. Surgeons nationwide who were identified as receiving nonresearch payment from industry in accordance with the Physician Payment Sunshine Act. Methods. The proportion of otolaryngologists receiving payment, the mean payment per otolaryngologist, and the standard deviation thereof were determined using the Open Payments database and compared to other surgical specialties. Otolaryngologists were further compared by specialization, census region, sponsor, and payment amount. Results. Less than half of otolaryngologists (48.1%) were reported as receiving payments over the study period, the second smallest proportion among surgical specialties. Otolaryngologists received the lowest mean payment per compensated individual (573) compared to other surgical specialties. Although otolaryngology had the smallest variance in payment among surgical specialties (SD, 2806), the distribution was skewed by top earners; the top 10% of earners accounted for 87% (2,199,254) of all payment to otolaryngologists. Otolaryngologists in the West census region were less likely to receive payments (38.6%, P<.001). Conclusion. Over the study period, otolaryngologists appeared to have more limited financial ties with industry compared to other surgeons, though variation exists within otolaryngology. Further refinement of the Open Payments database is needed to explore differences between otolaryngologists and leverage payment information as a tool for self-regulation. © 2015 American Academy of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery Foundation."

To succeed, the ACO must improve value by reducing costs while either maintaining or improving the quality of care. We examined changes from 2008 through 2013 in the cost and quality of care for Partners for Kids (PFK), a pediatric ACO serving an Ohio Medicaid population. METHODS: We measured the historical cost of care for PFK and gathered comparison statewide Ohio Medicaid fee-for-service (FFS) and managed care (MC) cost histories. Changes in quality of care measures were assessed by using 15 Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Pediatric Quality Indicators and 4 indicators targeted by PFK. RESULTS: PFK per-member-per-month costs were lower in 2008 than either FFS or MC (P < .001) costs and grew at a rate of $2.40 per year compared with FFS increases of $16.15 per year (P < .001) and MC increases of $6.47 per year (P < .121) with ~3.5 million membermonths each year. The quality of care of children in PFK improved significantly (P < .05) in 2011-2013 versus 2008-2010 on 5 quality measures (including 2 composite measures) and declined significantly on 3 measures. Other measures did not change or were rare events with no measureable change. CONCLUSIONS: PFK reduced the growth in costs compared with FFS Medicaid and averages less than MC Medicaid. This slowing in cost growth was achieved without diminishing the overall quality or outcomes of care. PFK thus improved the value of care for Medicaid children.

However, the collection of detailed clinical information about reported cases, which is necessary to confirm the diagnosis, to understand transmission, or to determine disease-related risk factors, is still heavily dependent on manual processes. The increasing prevalence and functionality of electronic health record (EHR) systems in the United States present important opportunities to advance public health surveillance. EHR data have the potential to further increase the breadth, detail, timeliness, and completeness of public health surveillance and thereby provide better data to guide public health interventions. EHRs also provide a unique opportunity to expand the role and vision of current surveillance efforts and to help bridge the gap between public health practice and clinical medicine.

Performance differences associated with characteristics of Pioneer ACOs have not been well described. METHODS: In a difference-in-differences analysis of Medicare fee-for-service claims, we compared Medicare spending for beneficiaries attributed to Pioneer ACOs (ACO group) with other beneficiaries (control group) before (2009 through 2011) and after (2012) the start of Pioneer ACO contracts, with adjustment for geographic area and beneficiaries' sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. We estimated differential changes in spending for several subgroups of ACOs: those with and those without clear financial integration between hospitals and physician groups, those with higher and those with lower baseline spending, and the 13 ACOs that withdrew from the Pioneer program after 2012 and the 19 that did not. RESULTS: Adjusted Medicare spending and spending trends were similar in the ACO group and the control group during the precontract period. In 2012, the total adjusted per-beneficiary spending differentially changed in the ACO group as compared with the control group (-$29.2 per quarter, P = 0.007), consistent with a 1.2% savings. Savings were significantly greater for ACOs with baseline spending above the local average, as compared with those with baseline spending below the local average (P = 0.05 for interaction), and for those serving high-spending areas, as compared with those serving low-spending areas (P = 0.04). Savings were similar in ACOs with financial integration between hospitals and physician groups and those without, as well as in ACOs that withdrew from the program and those that did not. CONCLUSIONS: Year 1 of the Pioneer ACO program was associated with modest reductions in Medicare spending. Savings were greater for ACOs with higher baseline spending than for those with lower baseline spending and were unrelated to withdrawal from the program.

One important way in which the Affordable Care Act is expanding coverage is by providing generous financial support to States that opt to expand Medicaid eligibility to all non-elderly individuals in families with incomes below 133 percent of the Federal Poverty Level. To date, 26 States and the District of Columbia have seized this opportunity, and since the beginning of the Affordable Care Act's first open enrollment period, 5.2 million people have gained Medicaid or Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) coverage in these States, a tally that will grow in the months and years ahead as Medicaid enrollment continues. In contrast, 24 States have not yet expanded Medicaid-including many of the States that would benefit most and sometimes because State legislatures have defied even their own governors-and denied health insurance coverage to millions of their citizens. Researchers at the Urban Institute estimate that, if these States do not change course, 5.7 million people will be deprived of health insurance coverage in 2016. Meanwhile, these States will forgo billions in Federal dollars that could boost their economies. This analysis uses the best evidence from the economics and health policy literatures to quantify several important consequences of States' decisions not to expand Medicaid. That evidence, which is based primarily on careful analysis of the effects of past policy decisions, is necessarily an imperfect guide to the future, and the actual effects of Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act could be larger or smaller than the estimates presented below. However, this evidence is clear that the consequences of States' decisions are far-reaching, with implications for the health and well-being of their citizens, their economies, and the economy of the Nation as a whole. © 2015 Nova Science Publishers, Inc."

In an attempt to address these concerns, the Department of Justice and Fair Trade Commission announced that they will use market share screens and rule of reason treatment to evaluate ACOs participating in the Medicare Shared Savings Program. The use of market share screens and rule of reason treatment allows the antitrust agencies to avoid prioritizing either consumer surplus or total surplus in the first instance but leaves open two critical questions: What will the rule of reason treatment afforded to ACOs look like? And how will the antitrust agencies ultimately determine whether ACOs benefit or harm consumers? In order to address these questions, this Note proposes that the antitrust agencies use the “big data” collected under the Affordable Care Act to conduct a structured rule of reason review of ACOs that takes into account both the consumer surplus and total surplus through a burden-shifting framework. © 2015 by Shaun E.

Additionally, doctors may get paid for services that they have provided for free to uninsured patients.

Results. Approximately 1/3 of the sample (31.9%) reported fair/poor health status, 10.9% reported food insecurity, and 52.6% reported public food assistance. Multivariate analyses revealed that, among women, those with food insecurity had significantly higher odds of reporting fair/poor health status (AOR = 2.14, 95% CI 1.20–3.82). Conclusions.

To promote efficiency, ACOs sign contracts under which they keep a fraction of the savings from keeping costs below target provided they also maintain quality levels. To promote integration and facilitate measurement, ACOs are required to have at least 5000 enrollees and so must coordinate across many providers. We calibrate a model of optimal ACO incentives using proprietary performance measures from a large insurer. Our key finding is that free-riding is a severe problem and causes optimal incentive payments to exceed cost savings unless ACOs simultaneously achieve extremely large efficiency gains. This implies that successful ACOs will likely rely on motivational strategies that amplify the effects of underpowered incentives. These motivational strategies raise important questions about the limits of ACOs as a policy for promoting more efficient, integrated care (JEL D23, D86, I12, L14, L24, M52). © The Author 2014."

Exceptional Child Center, Inc., the US Supreme Court revisited the question of whether Medicaid providers may seek relief in federal courts when states fail to pay ""sufficient"" Medicaid rates.

Payment sufficiency is vital to Medicaid's success in expanding health insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act. By terminating providers' ability to seek relief in federal courts, Armstrong makes it easier for states to cut Medicaid payment rates at the same time that millions of new enrollees will enter the program, undercutting operation of the Medicaid program and its role in health care reform. © 2015 by Project HOPE-The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc."

The simulations suggest that two options-extending eligibility either to the end of a calendar year or for twelve months after enrollment-would be the most effective methods for reducing churning.

How is it possible that the United States, which spends more than any other nation on health care and insurance, now has a population markedly less healthy than those of many other nations? Sociologist and public health expert James S. House analyzes this paradoxical crisis, offering surprising new explanations for how and why the United States has fallen into this trap. In Beyond Obamacare, House shows that health care reforms, including the Affordable Care Act, cannot resolve this crisis because they do not focus on the underlying causes for the nation’s poor health outcomes, which are largely social, economic, environmental, psychological, and behavioral. House demonstrates that the problems of our broken health care and insurance system are interconnected with our large and growing social disparities in education, income, and other conditions of life and work, and calls for a complete reorientation of how we think about health. He concludes that we need to move away from our misguided and almost exclusive focus on biomedical determinants of health, and to place more emphasis on addressing social, economic, and other inequalities. House’s review of the evidence suggests that the landmark Affordable Care Act of 2010, and even universal access to health care, are likely to yield only marginal improvements in population health or in reducing health care expenditures. In order to rein in spending and improve population health, we need to refocus health policy from the supply side-which makes more and presumably better health care available to more citizens-to the demand side-which would improve population health though means other than health care and insurance, thereby reducing need and spending for health care. House shows how policies that provide expanded educational opportunities, more and better jobs and income, reduced racial-ethnic discrimination and segregation, and improved neighborhood quality enhance population health and quality of life as well as help curb health spending. He recommends redirecting funds from inefficient supply-side health care measures toward broader social initiatives focused on education, income support, civil rights, housing and neighborhoods, and other reforms, which can be paid for from savings in expenditures for health care and insurance.

Using 1991-2011 data before and after a 1999 premium subsidy policy change in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP), we find that the employer premium contribution scheme has a differential impact on health plan pricing based on two market incentives: 1) consumers are less price sensitive when they only need to pay part of the premium increase, and 2) each health plan has an incentive to increase the employer's premium contribution to that plan. Both incentives are found to contribute to premium growth. Counterfactual simulation shows that average premium would have been 10% less than observed and the federal government would have saved 15% per year on its premium contribution had the subsidy policy change not occurred in the FEHBP.

One such issue is the pricing of these insurance packages and whether or not the reimbursements will cover necessary services. Therefore, policy concerns exist that increasing the number of insured individuals may not curtail costs. Conversely, providers may not wish to treat patients covered by excessively frugal plans such as Medicaid; hence the trade-offs between access and cost control. In this article, we present findings from a cost function and a productivity approach to determine the marginal cost of providing inpatient hospital care for hospitals operating in Florida during 2005. Using these methodological approaches, we are able to use the marginal rate of transformation to determine the relative marginal costs while controlling for hospital technical and allocative inefficiency. Our work differs from earlier articles as we avoid the Greene problem for cross-sectional models through a two-step approach. By including both reimbursement rates under conditions of hospital efficiency, we can ascertain payment schemes that should, at least in theory, cover necessary costs for patient care without leading to excessive input usage. © 2015 Taylor & Francis."

This model is unique in that it is not a permanent medical home model but rather bridges the gap between entry into the health care system and a permanent medical home. It unites the disciplines of nursing, psychology, social work, medicine, and nutrition to provide interprofessional education and health care in a sustainable nurse-managed health clinic model built on community partnerships. It is where national and local health policy meets the ""real life"" of individuals with limited resources. The Affordable Care Act improves access to primary care and offers nurses the opportunity to play a key role in transforming the health care system and improving patient care, and the Bridge Care clinic model is an innovative approach that improves access to quality primary care and prepares future nurse practitioners to be leaders in the health care system. © 2015 Elsevier Inc."

We examined the association between the size and growth of Latino populations and hospitals' uncompensated care in California. Methods. Our sample consisted of general acute care hospitals in California operating during 2000 and 2010 (n = 251). We merged California hospital data with US Census data for each hospital service area. We used spatial analysis, multivariate regression, and fixed-effect models. Results. We found a significant association between the growth of California's Latino population and hospitals' uncompensated care in the unadjusted regression. This association was still significant after we controlled for hospital and community population characteristics. After we added market characteristics into the final model, this relationship became nonsignificant. Conclusions. Our findings suggest that systematic support is needed in areas with rapid Latino population growth to control hospitals' uncompensated care, especially if Latinos are excluded from or do not respond to the insurance options made available through the Affordable Care Act. Improving availability of resources for hospitals and providers in areas with high Latino population growth could help alleviate financial pressures. © 2015, American Public Health Association Inc.

Baby boomers presently dominate the registered nurse (RN) workforce, accounting for 40% of actively working RNs who will soon be entering retirement. In 2011, nursing schools were unable to accept 60,000 qualified applicants as a result of budgetary constraints and insufficient numbers of faculty, clinical preceptors, and clinical sites. Although the United States has previously experienced nursing shortages, projections estimate that this RN shortage will likely surpass 500,000 RNs by the year 2025 and will persist for the long term. It is forecasted that the shortage will affect the delivery of healthcare directly, as well as the quality of patient care. Factors thought to be contributing to the anticipated shortage include the increasing number of individuals insured through the Affordable Care Act, the healthcare demands from the elderly population, and the retiring baby-boomer RN workforce. According to 2013 data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, it is anticipated that by 2020, there will be a need for 1.05 million RNs in the United States.

This payment approach is said to increase the volume of services without improving care coordination. In response to these calls, Medicare and private payers are experimenting with payment systems that combine the basic element of FFS-a fee for each service-with arrangements that allow providers to share the savings if they hold total spending per patient below a targeted amount. Medicare's accountable care organizations (ACOs) embody the shared savings approach to payment reform. Private payers have introduced total cost of care contracting (TCOC) in several locations. This article questions the consensus that FFS must go. If the fees are too high, then someone needs to ""bite the bullet"" and reduce fees in key areas. Hoping to control overspending by investment in ACOs is wishful thinking. I describe the theory and practice of shared savings payment systems and summarize recent TCOC contracting initiatives in the private sector.

We found that the policy was associated with a 42 percent greater probability of adhering to primary care providers. Furthermore, patients who were always adherent had a higher probability of having no ED visits (change in probability: 2.1 percent) and no hospitalizations (change in probability: 1.7 percent), compared to those who were never adherent.

The US Affordable Care Act requires healthcare organizations to collect certain metrics, including patient assessments of quality, in order to monitor and improve the quality of healthcare. These metrics are used as a basis for graduated insurance reimbursements, and are available to consumers as an aid in selecting healthcare providers and insurance plans. The purpose of this paper is to provide healthcare providers with the analytic capabilities to better understand quality of care from the patient’s point of view.

Findings - Results show that variables related to Access, Moving Through the Visit, Nurse/Assistant, Care Provider and Personal Issues significantly impact overall assessments of care quality. In addition, while gender and type of care provider do not appear to have an impact on overall patient satisfaction, significant differences do exist based on age group, specialty of the physician and clinic type.

Although providing feedback is important, it is also necessary for leaders to receive feedback from their teams regarding their performance as leaders.

We used adjudicated fee-for-service facility claims from a large commercial insurer for colonoscopies occurring in hospital outpatient department or ambulatory surgery center from October 2005 to December 2012. Claims were matched to provider- and market-level data. Linear fixed effects regressions of negotiated colonoscopy price were run on provider, system, and market characteristics. Markets were defined as counties. There were 178 433 claims from 169 providers (104 systems). The mean system market share was 76% (SD = 0.34) and the mean real (deflated) price was US$1363 (SD = 374), ranging from US$169 to US$2748. For every percentage point increase in a system or individual facility's bed share, relative price increased by 2 to 4 percentage points; this result was stable across a number of specifications. Market population and price were also consistently positively related, though this relation was small in magnitude. No other factor explained price as strongly as market share. Price variation for colonoscopy was driven primarily by market share, of particular concern as the number of mergers increases in wake of the recession and the Affordable Care Act. Whether variation is justified by better quality care requires further research to determine whether quality is subsumed in prices. © The Author(s) 2015."

In the meantime, we analyzed the experience of hospitals in Connecticut, which expanded Medicaid coverage to a large number of childless adults in April 2010 under the ACA. Using hospital-level panel data from Medicare cost reports, we performed difference-in-differences analyses to compare the change in Medicaid volume and uncompensated care in the period 2007-13 in Connecticut to changes in other Northeastern states. We found that early Medicaid expansion in Connecticut was associated with an increase in Medicaid discharges of 7-9 percentage points, relative to a baseline rate of 11 percent, and an increase of 7-8 percentage points in Medicaid revenue as a share of total revenue, relative to a baseline share of 10 percent. Also, in contrast to the national and regional trends of increasing uncompensated care during this period, hospitals in Connecticut experienced no increase in uncompensated care. We conclude that uncompensated care in Connecticut was roughly one-third lower than what it would have been without early Medicaid expansion.

The 2010 Affordable Care Act (ACA) attempts to curb health care spending by incentivizing high-value care through the creation of Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs), which assume financial risk for patient outcomes. With this financial risk, health systems creating ACOs will be motivated to pursue innovative care models that maximize the value of care. Palliative care, as an emerging field with a growing evidence base, is positioned to improve value in ACOs by increasing high-quality care and decreasing costs for the sickest patients.

Although the Polk County Health Department has a long history of collaboration with the local health care community, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, coupled with meaningful use requirements for health care providers, sharply increased engagement, contributed to shared priorities, and brought this relationship to a new level. Partners have now convened community-based workgroups around the top 3 health focus areas selected from the assessment process. Community health assessment emphasized the social determinants of health as a step toward a more ""upstream"" orientation to population health goals.

Data Sources/Study Setting Medicare data from before (2006) and after (2009) MHR implementation. Study Design We performed a retrospective difference-in-differences analysis of quantity of outpatient visits, proportion of outpatient quality metrics met, and costs of care for Medicare patients with ≥1 chronic disease in 2006 versus 2009. We used the remaining states in New England as controls. Data Collection/Extraction Methods We used existing Medicare claims data provided by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Principal Findings MHR was not associated with a decrease in outpatient visits per year compared to controls (9.4 prereform to 9.6 postreform in MA vs. 9.4-9.5 in controls, p =.32). Quality of care in MA improved more than controls for hemoglobin A1c monitoring, mammography, and influenza vaccination, and similarly to controls for diabetic eye examination, colon cancer screening, and pneumococcal vaccination. Average costs for patients in Massachusetts increased from $9,389 to $10,668, versus $8,375 to $9,114 in control states (p <.001). Conclusions MHR was not associated with worsening in access or quality of outpatient care for the already-insured, and it had modest effects on costs.

Despite the emergence of numerous evidence-based interventions, wide variations in clinical care have caused disparities in quality of care and cost. Comparative effectiveness and cost effectiveness research may better guide healthcare decisionmakers in determining which interventions work best, for which populations, under which conditions, and at what cost. Methods: This article reviews national health policies that promote comparative effectiveness research (CER), healthcare decisionmaker roles in CER, methodological approaches to CER, and future implications of CER. Results: This article provides a brief summary of CER health policy up to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and its establishment of the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI). Through PCORI, participatory methods for engaging healthcare decisionmakers in the entire CER process have gained momentum as a strategy for improving the relevance of research and expediting the translation of research into practice. Well-designed, methodologically rigorous observational studies and randomized trials conducted in real-world settings have the potential to improve the quality, generalizability, and transferability of study findings. Conclusion: Learning health systems and practice-based research networks provide the infrastructure for advancing CER methods, generating local solutions to high-quality cost-effective care, and transitioning research into implementation and dissemination science—all of which will ultimately guide health policy on clinical care, payment for care, and population health. © Academic Division of Ochsner Clinic Foundation."

Comparing Vermont's failed effort to adopt single-payer legislation in 1994 to present efforts, we find that Vermont faced similar challenges but greater opportunities in 2010 that enabled reform.Aclosely contested gubernatorial election and a progressive social movement opened a window of opportunity to advance legislation to design three comprehensive health reformoptions for legislative consideration.With a unified Democratic government under the leadership of a single-payer proponent, a high-profile policy proposal, and relatively weak opposition, a framework for a single-payer system was adopted by the legislature-though with many details and political battles to be fought in the future.

We used adjudicated fee-for-service facility claims from a large commercial insurer for colonoscopies occurring in hospital outpatient department or ambulatory surgery center from October 2005 to December 2012. Claims were matched to provider- and market-level data. Linear fixed effects regressions of negotiated colonoscopy price were run on provider, system, and market characteristics. Markets were defined as counties. There were 178,433 claims from 169 providers (104 systems). The mean system market share was 76% (SD = 0.34) and the mean real (deflated) price was US$1363 (SD = 374), ranging from US$169 to US$2748. For every percentage point increase in a system or individual facility's bed share, relative price increased by 2 to 4 percentage points; this result was stable across a number of specifications. Market population and price were also consistently positively related, though this relation was small in magnitude. No other factor explained price as strongly as market share. Price variation for colonoscopy was driven primarily by market share, of particular concern as the number of mergers increases in wake of the recession and the Affordable Care Act. Whether variation is justified by better quality care requires further research to determine whether quality is subsumed in prices. © The Author(s) 2015."

Objective.-To develop a dynamic modeling tool to examine how individual factors and practice variables can forecast demand for pathologist services. Design.-Build and test a computer-based software model populated with data from surveys and best estimates about current and new pathologist efforts. Results.-Most pathologists' efforts focus on anatomic (52%), laboratory (14%), and other direct services (8%) for individual patients. Population-focused services (12%) (eg, laboratory medical direction) and other professional responsibilities (14%) (eg, teaching, research, and hospital committees) consume the rest of their time. Modeling scenarios were used to assess the need to increase or decrease efforts related globally to the Affordable Care Act, and specifically, to genomic medicine, laboratory consolidation, laboratory medical direction, and new areas where pathologists' expertise can add value. Conclusions.-Our modeling tool allows pathologists, educators, and policy experts to assess how various factors may affect demand for pathologists' services. These factors include an aging population, advances in biomedical technology, and changing roles in capitated, value-based, and team-based medical care systems. In the future, pathologists will likely have to assume new roles, develop new expertise, and become more efficient in practicing medicine to accommodate new value-based delivery models.

While the general population focuses on health insurance, in the medical community anxiety and trepidation persist over increasing capitation and loss of revenues. Many medical practitioners are abandoning the profession. Those that remain are tightening their belts and preparing for lean times. Wage freezes and reductions in forces are two common strategies for reducing expenses. These strategies harshly impact the lowest paid members of the medical community which includes the receptionists, schedulers, file clerks, insurance clerks, medical assistants, and some nurses. Medical managers are being challenged to attract, motivate, and retain employees that can provide superior patient service under these conditions. Case Synopsis: Rachel, the office manager for a multi-million dollar pediatric practice in Longview, Texas, is facing escalating employee problems as the doctors withhold raises and promotions from their staff. The doctors contend that revenue losses are an imminent result of the Affordable Health Care Act and have staunchly resisted most pleas for pay increases for deserving employees. Rachel has implemented a number of creative managerial initiatives in hopes of motivating and retaining valuable human assets. Despite her efforts, annual employee turnover in the clinic has jumped from 10 percent historically to more than to 60 percent in each of the last three years."

IfACOs are to improve health care quality and lower costs, quality measures will be increasingly important in determining if provider consolidations associated with the development of ACOs are achieving their intended purpose. This article assesses quality measurement across public and private sectors. We reviewed available quality measures for a subset of programs in six organizations and assessed the number and domain of measures (structure, process, outcomes, and patient experience). Two-thirds of all quality measures were categorized as process measures. Outcome measures made up nearly 20 percent of measures. Patient experience and structure measures made up approximately 8 percent and 7 percent, respectively. We propose further improvements to quality measurement initiatives. For example, programs that reward providers should consider reward size and distribution within the organization. Quality improvement initiatives should consider what encourages provider buy-in and participation and the effects on populations with disproportionate health care needs. As the focus of quality initiatives may change from year to year, measures should be periodically revisited to ensure continued improvement and sustainability.

We compared trends in preventive visits and recommended preventive services among Medicare fee-for-service and Medicare health maintenance organization (HMO) patients as well as non-Medicare patients ages 65-75 who were covered by private fee-forservice and private HMO plans. Among Medicare fee-for-service patients, the annual use of preventive visits rose from 1.4 percent before the implementation of the ACA to 27.5 percent afterward. This increase was significantly larger than was seen for patients in the other insurance groups. Nevertheless, rates of annual preventive care visit use among Medicare fee-for-service patients remained 10-20 percentage points lower than was the case for people with private coverage (43-44 percent) or those in a Medicare HMO (53 percent).

The possibility of death spirals has garnered recent policy and popular attention because the pricing regulations in the Affordable Care Act (ACA) of 2010 make health plans more vulnerable to them (though some other aspects of the ACA limit them). Most death spirals tracked in the literature have involved selection against a group health plan that was dropped quickly by the employer. In this article, we empirically document a death spiral in individual health insurance that was apparently triggered by a block closure in 1981 and developed slowly because the insurer partially subsidized the block. We show that premiums rose dramatically from around the time of the block closure to at least 2009 (the last year of available data). By 2009, some, but very few, policyholders remained in the block, and premiums were roughly seven times that of a yardstick we developed.

Although much of the extant research focuses on the impact of traditional media on factual knowledge, research is expanding to include a variety of media sources and multiple dimensions of knowledge, in addition to understanding processes that better explain these relationships. Using a nationwide, opt-in online survey (n = 993), we examine the relationship between partisan media and structural knowledge, which assess how interconnected people see political concepts. Utilizing understanding of the Affordable Care Act as the content area of interest, we examine whether exposure to partisan media has differential effects on attitudinal ambivalence—holding both positive and negative attitudes toward an object—based on the political ideology of the respondent, and whether this impact of ambivalence influenced structural knowledge. Our results show that exposure to attitude-consistent media decreased attitudinal ambivalence. This exposure to attitude-consistent media results in a positive indirect effect on structural knowledge through this decrease in ambivalence. We find the reverse effect for use of attitude-inconsistent media. © 2015, Mass Communication & Society Division of the Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication."

Along with sweeping changes in service delivery and payment structures, health care reform has championed concepts such as patient-centered care, integrated care, and wellness. Although these are not new ideas, their adaptation, in both ideology and service design has been accelerated in the context for reform. Indeed they are reaching a tipping point; the point where ideas gain wide acceptance and become influential trends. Although psychiatric mental health (PMH) nurses have been active in wellness, patient-centered care, and integrated care, at the current time they seem to be situated peripheral to these national trends. Increased presence of PMH nurses will facilitate their contribution to the development of these concepts within service structures and interventions. To increase knowledge and appreciation of PMH nurses' practice and unique perspective on these issues, leaders are needed who will connect and effectively communicate PMH nursing efforts to the broader health care arena. This article outlines the events that created a context for these three concepts (patient-centered care, wellness, and integrated care), and I suggest why they have reached a tipping point and discuss the need for greater PMH nursing presence in the American national dialog and the role of nursing leaders in facilitating these connections. © 2015 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc."

Gene expression profiling is a potentially cost-effective innovation that guides chemotherapy decisions in early-stage breast cancer, but adoption has been uneven across the United States. Using a sample of commercially insured women, we evaluated whether income inequality in metropolitan areas was associated with receipt of gene expression profiling during its initial diffusion in 2006-07. In areas with high income inequality, gene expression profiling receipt was higher than elsewhere, but it was associated with a 10.6-percentage-point gap between high- and lowincome women. In areas with low rates of income inequality, gene expression profiling receipt was lower, with no significant differences by income. Even among insured women, income inequality may indirectly shape diffusion of gene expression profiling, with benefits accruing to the highest-income patients in the most unequal places. Policies reducing gene expression profiling disparities should address low-inequality areas and, in unequal places, practice settings serving low-income patients. ©2015 Project HOPE- The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc."

Specifically, the literature examines only how retirement may affect the health insurance available to the potential retiree but not how it might affect a spouse's options. Using data from the Health and Retirement Study, I find that the impact a husband's retirement might have on a wife's health insurance options has a statistically significant impact on a husband's rate of retirement that is independent of considerations of his own health insurance options. In households where the wife is the only one at risk of losing affordable health insurance if the husband retires, the husband is 30% less likely to retire than if neither spouse is at risk (a 5 percentage point decrease in the retirement rate). Based on these findings, prior research is missing one avenue that changes to the Medicare eligibility age and health insurance policy changes through the Affordable Care Act might impact the labor supply of older workers.

CVD is understudied among Latinos, who have high levels of CVD risk factors. This study aimed to determine whether access to health care (ie, insurance status and having a usual source of care) is associated with 4 CVD prevention factors (ie, health care utilization, CVD screening, information received from health care providers, and lifestyle factors) among Latino adults and to evaluate whether the associations depended on CVD clinical risk/disease. Data were collected as part of a community-engaged food environment intervention study in East Los Angeles and Boyle Heights, CA. Logistic regressions were fitted with insurance status and usual source of care as predictors of the 4 CVD prevention factors while controlling for demographics. Analyses were repeated with interactions between self-reported CVD clinical risk/disease and access to care measures. Access to health care significantly increased the odds of CVD prevention. Having a usual source of care was associated with all factors of prevention, whereas being insured was only associated with some factors of prevention. CVD clinical risk/disease did not moderate any associations. Although efforts to reduce CVD risk among Latinos through the Affordable Care Act could be impactful, they might have limited impact in curbing CVD among Latinos, via the law's expansion of insurance coverage.

However, WHWPs face organizational, economic, systematic, legal, and logistical challenges which have combined to impact program availability and expansion. Even so, there is a burgeoning body of evidence indicating WHWPs can significantly improve the health profile of participating employees in a cost effective manner. This foundation of scientific knowledge justifies further research inquiry to elucidate optimal WHWP models. It is clear that the development, implementation and operation of WHWPs require a strong commitment from organizational leadership, a pervasive culture of health and availability of necessary resources and infrastructure. Since organizations vary significantly, there is a need to have flexibility in creating a customized, effective health and wellness program. Furthermore, several key legal issues must be addressed to facilitate employer and employee needs and responsibilities; the US Affordable Care Act will play a major role moving forward.

Data sources: This was a descriptive, correlational survey of APRNs in New Mexico exploring autonomy and empowerment in relation to variables of physician oversight, geographical location, and practice setting. Conclusions: New Mexico's APRN Nurse Practice Act supports independent practice and prescriptive authority. Results indicated that APRNs are highly empowered and autonomous. However, nearly 40% of respondents identified practicing with physician oversight. Further investigation of subscales of empowerment also provided insight of relationships among healthcare team members, particularly physicians.

It has been suggested that surveillance will expand to include hip and knee surgery-related readmissions in the future. To ensure quality of care and avoid penalties, readmissions related to hip fractures require further investigation. The goal of this study was to evaluate factors associated with 30-day hospital readmission after hip fracture at a level I trauma center. This retrospective cohort study included 1486 patients who were 65 years or older and had a surgical procedure performed to treat a femoral neck, intertrochanteric, and/or sub-trochanteric hip fracture during an 8-year period. Analysis of these patients showed a 30-day readmission rate of 9.35% (n=139). Patients in the readmission group had a significantly higher rate of pre-existing diabetes and pulmonary disease and a longer initial hospital length of stay. Readmissions were primarily the result of medical complications, with only one-fourth occurring secondary to orthopedic surgical failure. Pre-existing pulmonary disease (odds ratio [OR], 1.885; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.305-2.724), initial hospitalization of 8 days or longer (OR, 1.853; 95% CI, 1.223-2.807), and discharge to a skilled nursing facility (OR, 1.586; 95% CI, 1.043-2.413) were determined to be predictors of readmission. Accordingly, patient management should be consistently geared toward optimizing chronic disease states while concomitantly working to minimize the duration of initial hospitalization and decrease readmission rates."

We then use the results from this simple predictive model to produce state-level projections of health care spending for 2010-2013 to subsequently compare those average projected state values with actual national spending for 2010-2013, finding that at least 70% of the recent slowdown in health care spending can likely be explained by long-standing patterns.

We studied insurer participation and premiums during the first two years of the Marketplaces. We found that the addition of a single insurer in a county was associated with a 1.2 percent lower premium for the average silver plan and a 3.5 percent lower premium for the benchmark plan in the federally run Marketplaces.

Methods: In June and July 2012 (before implementation of the Affordable Care Act), a medical student and two social work students trained in insurance eligibility approached a convenience sample of uninsured adult ED patients (age ≥19 years) whose conditions warranted discharge after treatment. The students administered a survey that collected information (age, marital status, income, family size, number of dependents, and pregnancy status) that was used to determine if the patient was eligible for medical insurance. Patients who were acutely ill, confused, under the influence of substances, acutely psychotic, non-English speaking, unable to give consent, under arrest, or being admitted or transferred were deemed ineligible for this study. Results: Of the 132 patients who participated in the study, 114 (86.4%) were eligible for insurance. The difference between the median incomes for those who were eligible for insurance and those who were not ($2,300 vs $17,388) was statistically significant (p<0.0001). Conclusion: EDs have a valuable opportunity to identify patients who are eligible for government-backed medical insurance programs.

Results: Aging out of this provision increased employment among men, employersponsored health insurance offers for women, and reports that health insurance coverage was worse than it was 1 year previously (overall and for young women). Uninsured rates did not increase at age 26 years, but there was an increase in the purchase of non-group health coverage, indicating interest in remaining insured after age 26 years.

Nutrition education is not required for educating and training physicians in many countries. Nutrition education for the spectrum of health care professionals is uncoordinated, which runs contrary to the current theme of interprofessional education. The central role of competencies in guiding medical education was emphasized and the urgent need to establish competencies in nutrition-related patient care was presented. The importance of additional strategies to improve nutrition education of health care professionals was highlighted.

Methods: We use the Health and Retirement Study to examine individuals age 65 and older admitted to LTC facilities between 2000 and 2010 (n = 3,351). We examine discharge patterns using survival analyses that account for the competing risk of death and estimate the probabilities of post-discharge living arrangements using multinomial logistic regression models. Results: Women are more likely than men to be discharged from LTC facilities during the first year of stay. Women are more likely to live alone or with kin after discharge, whereas men are more likely to live with a spouse or transfer to another institution. Gender differences in the availability and use of family support may partly account for the gender disparity of LTC discharge and post-discharge living arrangements. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that women and men follow distinct pathways after LTC discharge. As local and federal efforts begin to place more emphasis on the transition from LTC facilities to prior communities (e.g., transitional care initiatives under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act), policymakers should take these gender differences into account in the design of community transition programs. © 2015 Jacobs Institute of Women's Health."

Methods We conducted a large household telephone survey in 2012 of CHIP enrollees and disenrollees in 10 states. We used survey responses to assess the perceptions and experiences of families with the CHIP application and renewal process. In addition, we combined the survey data with CHIP/Medicaid administrative data to analyze coverage outcomes of children after disenrolling. Results A large majority of recent CHIP enrollees had positive impressions of the application process; 89% found the process very or somewhat easy, and 90% of those receiving assistance found it very helpful. Families had similarly favorable impressions of the renewal process, including those recently disenrolling from CHIP. After disenrolling, children were far more likely to gain Medicaid coverage (49%) than private insurance (18%), while a sizable percentage were uninsured (32%). The likelihood of becoming uninsured was especially high among 18- and 19-year-olds (62%), who lost CHIP coverage due to their age. Conclusions Satisfaction with the CHIP application and renewal process is high among those with recent coverage, consistent with efforts by many states to simplify these processes for families.

Results from interrupted time-series analyses indicate demand-augmenting effects for coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and business-stealing effects for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedures: high entrant market share mitigated the declining incidence of CABG, but it had no significant effect on the rising trend in PCI use, among patients with coronary artery disease. We further find evidence that entry by new cardiac surgery centers tended to sort high-severity patients into the more invasive CABG procedure and low-severity patients into the less invasive PCI procedures. These findings underscore the importance of considering market-level strategic responses by hospitals when regulatory barriers are rescinded. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

Methods: Data came from the 2013 Uniform Data System for colorectal and cervical cancer screening rates among patients of federally qualified health centers (FQHCs); the 2012 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System for colorectal, cervical, and breast cancer screening rates; and the US Cancer Statistics (2007-2011) for colorectal, cervical, and breast cancer mortality-toincidence ratios (MIRs). Dyads of Medicaid expansion decisions with cancer screening rates and MIRs were mapped using ArcMap. Results: States that had not expanded Medicaid as of September 2014 had lower cancer screening rates, especially among FQHC patients. Overall, cancer MIRs were not significantly different by Medicaid expansion status. However, Southeastern states without Medicaid expansion tended to have higher cancer MIRs and lower screening rates. Conclusions: Disparities in cancer screening that already disfavor states with high cancer rates may widen in states that have not chosen to expand Medicaid unless significant efforts are mounted to ensure their residents obtain preventive health care."

In the absence of dental coverage, patients may resort to costly emergency department (ED) visits for dental conditions. Medicaid coverage of dental benefits could help ease the burden on the ED, but ED use for dental conditions might remain a problem in areas with a scarcity of dentists. We examined county-level rates of ED visits for nontraumatic dental conditions in twenty-nine states in 2010 in relation to dental provider density and Medicaid coverage of nonemergency dental services. Higher density of dental providers was associated with lower rates of dental ED visits by patients with Medicaid in rural counties but not in urban counties, where most dental ED visits occurred. County-level Medicaid-funded dental ED visit rates were lower in states where Medicaid covered nonemergency dental services than in other states, although this difference was not significant after other factors were adjusted for. Providing dental coverage alone might not reduce Medicaid-funded dental ED visits if patients do not have access to dental providers. © 2015 Project HOPE-The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc."

Methods: We included 6494 Massachusetts Medicaid members who received services from a health care for the homeless program in 2010. We used negative binomial regression to examine variables associated with frequent utilization. Results: Approximately one third of the study population had at least 1 hospitalization and two thirds had 1 or more ED visits. More than 70% of hospitalizations and ED visits were incurred by only 12% and 21% of these members, respectively. Homeless individuals with co-occurring mental illness and substance use disorders were at greatest risk for frequent hospitalizations and ED visits (e.g., incidence rate ratios [IRRs] = 2.9-13.8 for hospitalizations). Individuals living on the streets also had significantly higher utilization (IRR = 1.5). Conclusions: Despite having insurance coverage, homeless Medicaid members experienced frequent hospitalizations and ED visits. States could consider provisions under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (e.g., Medicaid expansion and Health Homes) jointly with housing programs to meet the needs of homeless individuals, which may improve the quality and cost effectiveness of care."

In addition, relationships also play a moderating role in the maintenance, exacerbation, or amelioration of chronic health problems. Although acknowledgment of the importance of these variables in the pathophysiology of a number of health conditions is reaching more prominence, the integration of assessments of family factors as part of standard health care has made little progress. With the arrival of the Affordable Care Act in the United States, there is a desire for earlier identification of these risk factors, and the ability to implement prevention programs that reduce risk, and enhance protective factors. On a global level, there is increased awareness of the health impact of relational problems, for example, many countries have attempted to implement programs to decrease domestic violence. More reliable and standardized assessments of key relational processes will enhance both of these missions, and allow comparison of a variety of prevention and intervention programs.

In this article, we show that the ACA has deepened the ‘brightness’ of unauthorised immigrants’ symbolic and social exclusion within the US health care system via a significant boundary expansion for US citizens and long-term legal immigrants that has no parallel for unauthorised immigrants. As an alternative model, we highlight two subnational jurisdictions—one city/county (San Francisco) and one state (Massachusetts)—to show how they have played more promising roles to reframe and unfreeze this ‘frozen-out’ population. While we demonstrate commonalities in how San Francisco and Massachusetts have successfully ‘blurred’ unauthorised immigrants’ symbolic exclusion and reduced their barriers to health care at the subnational level, we also highlight their mutual limitations, which signal an ongoing need for federal inclusion currently out of sight.

As such, agencies routinely make decisions about when to promulgate regulations and when to enforce statutory requirements against parties who violate the law. During the 113th Congress, the Obama Administration announced that certain federal agencies would not enforce specific aspects of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) for a period of time in order to allow the public to further prepare for proper compliance with the law in the future. This has led to numerous questions regarding how courts treat administrative delays of regulatory programs. When can a suit be brought to force the agency to apply the law? It is important to distinguish between two distinct types of agency delays: (1) delays resulting from when an agency fails to meet a statutory deadline for promulgating rules or completing particular adjudications, and (2) affirmative decisions to withhold enforcement of a provision of law on the public at large.

Methods: Using 2009 data from hospital tax filings to the Internal Revenue Service and the 2010 County Health Rankings, we employed both univariate and multivariate analyses to examine the relationship between community health needs and the types and levels of hospitals' community benefit expenditures. The study sample included 1522 private, tax-exempt hospitals throughout the United States. Results: We found some patterns between community health needs and hospitals' expenditures on community benefits. Hospitals located in communities with greater health needs spent more as a percentage of their operating budgets on benefits directly related to patient care. By contrast, spending on community health improvement initiatives was unrelated to community health needs. Conclusions: Important opportunities exist for tax-exempt hospitals to improve the alignment between their community benefit activities and the health needs of the community they serve.

We estimate that adults with Medicaid coverage at any point in the year have an average of 1.32 visits per year to primary care providers, 0.48 more visits than low-income adults without Medicaid. Consequently, we project a need for 2,113 additional primary care providers (range: 1,130-3,138) if all states expand Medicaid. Our estimates are somewhat lower than several recent forecasts, which may not have controlled adequately for selection bias, and which used non-representative samples for forecasting.

Using patient narratives provided by 252 colorectal cancer patients, we explored the experience of financial barriers to care seeking. Of the 252 patients interviewed, 84 identified financial barriers as a significant hurdle to obtaining health care for their colorectal cancer symptoms. Using verbatim transcripts of the narratives collected from patients between 2008 and 2010, three themes were identified: insurance status as a barrier (discussed by n = 84; 100% of subsample), finding medical care (discussed by n = 30; 36% of subsample) and, insurance companies as barriers (discussed by n = 7; 8% of subsample). Our analysis revealed that insurance status is more nuanced than the categories insured/uninsured and differentially affects how patients attempt to secure health care. While barriers to medical care for the uninsured have been well documented, the experiences of those who are underinsured are less well understood. To improve outcomes in these patients it is critical to understand how financial barriers to medical care are manifested.

Methods Using a mixed-methods research approach, we investigated the integration of CHWs into health care teams from the CHW perspective. We conducted a survey of 265 CHWs and interviews with 23 CHWs to better understand and describe their experience and their perceived opportunities and challenges regarding their integration within the context of health care reform. Results Feelings of organizational support were positively correlated with the number of CHWs in the organization.

Background: The Affordable Care Act is expected to provide 32 million Americans with health insurance, and NPs are gaining attention in addressing this increasing demand for healthcare providers. However, there is limited analysis of the transition from registered nurse to NP. Oftentimes, during this transition, there is a shift from an experienced, expert status to an inexperienced, novice status, with a subsequent loss of confidence in one's ability and competence. This can hinder successful role development and affect employment continuity within the first year of practice. Methods and Sources: NP role transition was examined using Walker and Avant's method of concept analysis. Electronic databases were searched using the terms role transition and nurse practitioner. Thirty articles from nursing, psychology, and business were included. Findings and Conclusions: The four defining attributes of NP role transition are absorption of the role, the shift from provider of care to prescriber of care, straddling two identities, and mixed emotions. Personal and environmental antecedents and consequences of the concept are identified.

Specifically, we test whether the expansion of Medicaid eligibility for pregnant women during the 1980s and 1990s affects hospitals' decisions to adopt neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). While Medicaid expansion provided new insurance to a substantial number of pregnant women, prior literature also finds that some newly insured women would otherwise have been covered by more generously reimbursed private sources. Such crowd-out, combined with Medicaid's low reimbursement rats, leads to a theoretically ambiguous net effect of Medicaid expansion on a hospital's incentive to invest in technology. Using American Hospital Association data, we find that on average, Medicaid expansion has no statistically significant effect on NICU adoption. However, we also find that in geographic areas where more of the newly Medicaid-insured may have come from the privately insured population, Medicaid expansion slows NICU adoption. This holds true particularly when Medicaid payment rates are very low relative to private payment rates. Our findings are consistent with prior evidence on reduced NICU adoption from increased managed-care penetration. We conclude by discussing the policy implications of our work for insurance expansions associated with the Affordable Care Act. © 2014 Elsevier B.V."

The Affordable Care Act (ACA) requires carriers in certain categories of health insurance to provide public justification for rate increases of 10 percent or more. We collected data on how states changed their rate review authority and requirements during 2010-13, the years immediately after enactment of the ACA, and we combined these data with carrier filings. We found that adjusted premiums in the individual market in states that had priorapproval authority combined with loss ratio requirements were lower in 2010-13 ($3,489) than premiums in states with no rate review authority or that had only file-and-use regulations, which gave the states no authority to block rate increases ($3,617). Adjusted premiums declined modestly in prior-approval states with loss ratio requirements, from $3,526 in 2010 to $3,452 in 2013, while premiums increased from $3,422 to $3,683 in states with no rate review authority or file-and-use regulations only. Our findings suggest that states with prior approval authority and loss ratio requirements constrained health insurance premium increases. © 2015 Project HOPE-The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc."

The Affordable Care Act has not only set in motion reform in the nation's health care system, but also opens up new opportunities for re-connecting the housing and health sectors. While housing affordability will remain the central challenge for low- and middle-income people, the strong evidence of how housing quality and affordability impacts health calls for a new framework that envisions housing as a platform for improving quality of life. This platform can be conceived as a multi-layered: as service delivery portal, as target for prevention, and as anchor for healthy neighborhoods. These layers are associated with different at-risk populations and different strategies for financing and policy action. Philanthropy can play a key role in re-connecting the sectors through its capacity to build the evidence base, change the discourse about housing, foster policy change, and promote innovation. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2015."

Although evidence regarding the correlation of patient satisfaction with care quality remains mixed, there is an increasing national emphasis on the importance of patient experience in physician reimbursement, credentialing, and public opinion. The introduction of the Affordable Care Act and value-based care purchasing has tied a portion of reimbursement to patient experience surveys and other metrics related to care quality rather than quantity. Through nationally recognized assessments such as the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) surveys and easily accessible websites such as RateMD and Yelp, patient opinion of care quality is more widely available and more important to pulmonary practice than ever before. Physician credentialing may also be impacted by the American Board of Internal Medicine's Maintenance of Certification program and potential future requirements for physicians to assess the patient experience to maintain certification.

Judicial review allows it to have the final say over the laws of the land, as well as decisions made by the other branches of government. In other words, the judiciary, alone, resolves controversies about the legitimacy and scope of legislation or executive action. Usually what this means is that a higher court exercises the authority to nullify legislative and executive actions on the basis of the constitution. In the United States in particular, a supreme, federal court accomplishes this task by strategically selecting case law that bears constitutionally on other cases and legislative statutes. The upshot is that it frequently restrains the other branches, if not rebukes them. The seminal Marbury v. Madison [1803] decision inspired a series of subsequent decisions in which the court either struck down or affirmed national and state laws, even though they could not punish executives if they were to ignore their judgments. The Supreme Court's 2012 decision in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, which declared the Affordable Care Act constitutional, is perhaps the most notable recent example. This is a very puzzling development. The judicial branch lacks any obvious way in which it can enforce its decisions; it lacks a militia or any other organised coercive force that can sanction the other government branches if they disobey its decisions. Moreover, the judicial branch lacks the power of the purse - it is at the mercy of the legislative branch for financial support. And furthermore, in the U.S. system and several other democracies characterised by judicial supremacy, judges are appointed by executives and vetted by legislatures. Even though unelected justices have the final say over the constitutionality - and thus legitimacy - of a country's laws in these contexts, they seem, in the most basic sense, beholden to the other branches of government. © Cambridge University Press 2015."

We exploit the kink in individuals' budgets set created by the famous ""donut hole,"" where insurance becomes discontinuously much less generous on the margin, to provide descriptive evidence of the drug purchase response to a price increase. We then specify and estimate a simple dynamic model of drug use that allows us to quantify the spending response along the entire nonlinear budget set. We use the model for counterfactual analysis of the increase in spending from ""filling"" the donut hole, as will be required by 2020 under the Affordable Care Act. In our baseline model, which considers spending decisions within a single year, we estimate that filling the donut hole will increase annual drug spending by about $150, or about 8 percent. About one-quarter of this spending increase reflects anticipatory behavior, coming from beneficiaries whose spending prior to the policy change would leave them short of reaching the donut hole. We also present descriptive evidence of cross-year substitution of spending by individuals who reach the kink, which motivates a simple extension to our baseline model that allows-in a highly stylized way-for individuals to engage in such cross-year substitution. Our estimates from this extension suggest that a large share of the $150 drug spending increase could be attributed to cross-year substitution, and the net increase could be as little as $45 a year. © The Author(s) 2015.

These patients account for a large proportion of emergency department (ED) utilization. Objective Our aim was to characterize this population and their ED use at a national level. Methods We used the 2010 National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) to describe demographics and clinical characteristics of nonelderly adults (≥18 years old and ≤64 years old) with Medicaid-covered ED visits. We defined frequent ED users as individuals who make ≥4 ED visits/year and business hours as 8 am to 5 pm. We used descriptive statistics to describe the epidemiology of Medicaid-covered ED visits. Results NHAMCS included 21,800 ED visits by nonelderly adults in 2010, of which 5,659 (24.09%) were covered by Medicaid insurance. Most ED visits covered by Medicaid were made by patients who are young (25 and 44 years old) and female (67.95%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 66.00-69.89). A large proportion of the ED visits covered by Medicaid were revisits within 72 h (14.66%; 95% CI 9.13-20.19) and from frequent ED users (32.32%; 95% CI 24.29-40.35). Almost half of all ED visits covered by Medicaid occurred during business hours (45.44%; 95% CI 43.45-47.43).

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (""ACA"") has led to a significant shift in health care delivery. The ACA promises that increased integration and a shift from quantity of performance to increased competition will create a system in which quality of health care will go up and prices will go down. Increasingly, due to the economic trends that respond to the ACA, including considerable consolidation both horizontally and vertically, it is imperative that the antitrust agencies provide an economically sound and administrable legal approach to efficiency-enhancing mergers. In this regard, horizontal hospital mergers present particular challenges for antitrust. Most hospital merger cases focus on cost-based efficiencies, as does most of the academic empirical literature. Yet, government policy seems out of sync with quality-enhancing efficiencies analysis. This Essay first provides a discussion of the welfare effects on quality and its implications for antitrust analysis. Then, the Essay explores quality-enhancing efficiencies analysis in both the 2010 Horizontal Merger Guidelines and in antitrust case law. In doing so, the Essay identifies areas of both clarity and ambiguity regarding quality-enhancing efficiencies policy. Third, the Essay draws parallels to an efficiency analysis of quality under rule of reason analysis, in which the Essay offers examples of resale price maintenance and tying of franchising contracts. Thereafter, the Essay addresses how agencies and courts should treat quality-enhancing efficiencies in mergers. In doing so, the Essay draws upon the existing academic literature in empirical industrial organization economics and public health on measurements of what is hospital quality in a consolidating health care marketplace. In its concluding section, the Essay advocates a more robust use of quality measurements as a guiding principle of merger law and policy that (1) is flexible enough for case by case analysis; (2) will provide for ease of administrability; and (3) will make outcomes fall more in line with sound economic analysis than the current system."

Study Design: Retrospective cohort study. Methods: The probabilities of nonurgent and PCS ED visits were derived on the basis of the New York University ED Classification Algorithm. We constructed a logit quasi-likelihood model to examine the insurance impact using 2008 Tennessee Hospital Outpatient Discharge Data. Results: Among a total of 2,177,955 ED visits in the analysis, uninsured status was significantly associated with the likelihood that an ED visit was nonurgent or PCS. These associations were different for men and women and across major racial groups. On average, uninsured status was associated with an increased probability of 0.038 of being nonurgent and 0.054 of being PCS, relative to private insurance status. The corresponding numbers for public insurance status were 0.060 and 0.075, respectively. For nonurgent or PCS probabilities that are not close to 0, higher nonurgent or PCS likelihoods corresponded to lower ED cost per visit to third-party insurers and patients. Conclusions: Lack of insurance was associated with a higher probability of a nonurgent or PCS ED visit when compared with private insurance. When uninsured individuals gain coverage under the Affordable Care Act through either Medicaid expansion (public coverage) or insurance exchanges (private coverage), the average nonurgent or PCS probabilities could change either way given the opposite effects of public and private insurance coverage. If a lower nonurgent or PCS likelihood materialized, it could be associated with higher ED costs. © 2015, Ascend Media. All rights reserved."

Fee-for-service is a factor in the high cost of health care in the US, and pay-for-performance systems may be a more manageable method for payment to control costs and manage quality. Payment systems: Pay-for-performance would mean that payments are no longer made on a case-by-case basis, but in 'global payments' to overseeing bodies known as accountable care organizations (ACOs). Accountable Care: If concepts such as the arrangement of ACOs work under the Affordable Care Act, then there is hope that national levels for the uninsured will mimic the improvements in Massachusetts in the past decade. ACOs are the next step under reform, but where are we really headed? Historically, difficult economic times have resulted in pooling of health services to develop integrated delivery systems such as the Mayo Clinic and Kaiser Permanente. Integrated delivery systems streamline care by better directing the care of the patient through an autonomous system rather than through costly, fragmented and often unnecessary care. These systems learn from their strengths and weaknesses, and improve access of patients to the proper modalities of care on a timely basis. The US has an excellent opportunity to achieve expanded health coverage and reform of the delivery system in this manner. Conclusions: Ultimately, ACOs are capable of starting America down a path towards universal health care by shaping organizations of providers, but time will present a greater picture of whether the US can adopt this framework. © 2015 Elsevier Inc."

Although enhanced access is an integral component of the PCMH model, the effect of PCMHs on access to primary care services is understudied. Objective: To determine whether PCMH practices are associated with better access to new appointments for nonelderly adults by direct measurement. Research Design: We estimated the relationship between practice PCMH status and access to care in multivariate regression models, adjusting for a robust set of patient, practice, and geographic characteristics; using data on 11,347 simulated patient calls to 7266 primary care practices across 10 US states merged with data on PCMH practices. Participants: Trained field staff posing as patients (age younger than 65 y) seeking a new primary care appointment with varying insurance status (private, Medicaid, or self-pay). Measures: Our primary predictor was practice PCMH status and our primary outcome was the ability of simulated patients to schedule a new appointment. Secondary outcomes included the number of days to that appointment; availability of after-hour appointments; and an appointment with an ongoing primary care provider. Results: Of the 7266 practices contacted for an appointment, 397 (5.5%) were National Committee for Quality Assurance-recognized PCMHs. In adjusted analyses, callers to PCMH practices compared with non-PCMH practices were more likely to schedule a new appointment (adjusted odds ratio = 1.26 (95% CI, 1.01-1.58); P = 0.04] and be offered after-hour appointments [adjusted odds ratio = 1.36 (95% CI, 1.04-1.75); P = 0.02].

Objective: To determine whether noticing or using calorie menu labels was associated with demographic characteristics of customers at a national fast-food chain currently implementing calorie menu labeling. Design: Cross-sectional analysis. Participants/setting: Customer receipts and survey data were collected from 329 participants using street-intercept survey methodology at 29 McDonald's restaurant locations in low- and high-income neighborhoods throughout the Phoenix, AZ, metropolitan area. Outcome measures: Calorie menu labeling awareness and use were assessed. The total number of calories purchased was evaluated using participants' itemized receipts. Statistical analyses: Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to calculate the odds of customers noticing or using calorie menu labels. Results: Approximately 60% of participants noticed calorie menu labels, whereas only 16% reported using the information for food or beverage purchases. Higher-income individuals had twice the odds of noticing calorie labels (P=0.029) and three times the odds of using them (P=0.004). Significant positive associations were found between individuals with a bachelor's degree or higher and use of calorie menu labels (odds ratio 3.25; P=0.023). Noticing calorie menu labels was not associated with purchasing fewer calories; however, those who reported using calorie information purchased 146 fewer calories than those who did not (P=0.001).

The current health care system in the United States suffers from high expenditures and poor quality. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, passed in 2010, attempts to save costs and improve quality of care by offering incentives to use Electronic Health Records systems. Part of the reform by this law is dependent on the use of technology in managing patient medical and health records. The objective is to reduce redundancy and increase quality by sharing medical information amongst different health organizations like hospitals, physician offices, laboratories and clinical institutions. The success of such reform requires the participation and collaboration of all these entities and their patients. Prior research shows that adoption of Electronic Medical Records systems by hospitals and physician offices has been evident but at a rate that is slower than in other countries. Aside from financial barriers, technical, psychological, social/legal and organizational barriers exist. In order to understand the impact of those barriers on the adoption of Electronic Health Records management by small physician offices better, a five-level adoption model is presented to define the stages of diffusion of EHR systems. Fifteen consolidated barriers are mapped to each adoption level. This research concentrates on smaller physician offices because hospitals and larger institutions are more ready and capable of adoption, according to previous research. The Diffusion of Technology Model by Rogers, the Theory of Planned Behavior by Ajzen and Fishbein, and Davis' Technology Acceptance Model are combined and extended. This model will be used to empirically measure physicians' attitudes, knowledge, social and legal influences, subjective norm and systems' ease of use and usefulness amongst other variables. These variables are applied as mediators or moderators of the intention and decision to adopt or move into subsequent levels of adoption with the goal of seeing what drives those decisions. © 2014 IEEE."

Having parents without continuous coverage was the greatest predictor of a child’s coverage gap in both 1998 and 2009. Compared to children with at least one parent continuously covered, children whose parents did not have continuous coverage had a significantly higher relative risk (RR) of a coverage gap [RR 17.96, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 14.48–22.29 in 1998; RR 12.88, 95 % CI 10.41–15.93 in 2009].

METHODS: The analyses of children aged 1 to 17 are based on AHRQ's 2006 and 2011 Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) and Nationwide Emergency Department Sample (NEDS) databases, and on AHRQ's pooled 2006 to 2011 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS). All estimates are nationally representative, and standard errors account for the complex survey designs. RESULTS: Although overall all-cause children's hospitalizations did not increase between 2006 and 2011, hospitalizations for all listed mental health conditions increased by nearly 50% among children aged 10 to 14 years, and by 21% for emergency department (ED) visits. Behavioral disorders experienced a shift in underlying patterns between 2006 and 2011: inpatient stays for alcohol-related disorders declined by 44%, but ED visits increased by 34% for substance-related disorders and by 71% for impulse control disorders. Inpatient visits for suicide, suicidal ideation, and self-injury increased by 104% for children ages 1 to 17 years, and by 151% for children ages 10 to 14 years during this period. A total of $11.6 billion was spent on hospital visits for mental health during this period. Medicaid covered half of the inpatient visits, but with 50% to 30% longer length of stays in 2006 and 2011, respectively, than private payers. Medicaid's overall share of the ED visits increased from 45% in 2006 to 53% in 2011. CONCLUSIONS: These alarming trends highlight the renewed need for research on mental health care for children.

The federally funded increase in reimbursements was aimed at expanding access to primary care for the growing number of Medicaid enrollees. The reimbursement increase expired at the end of 2014 in most states before policymakers had much empirical evidence about its effects. METHODS: We measured the availability of and waiting times for appointments in 10 states during two periods: from November 2012 through March 2013 and from May 2014 through July 2014. Trained field staff posed as either Medicaid enrollees or privately insured enrollees seeking new-patient primary care appointments. We estimated state-level changes over time in a stable cohort of primary care practices that participated in Medicaid to assess whether willingness to provide appointments for new Medicaid enrollees was related to the size of increases in Medicaid reimbursements in each state. RESULTS: The availability of primary care appointments in the Medicaid group increased by 7.7 percentage points, from 58.7% to 66.4%, between the two time periods. The states with the largest increases in availability tended to be those with the largest increases in reimbursements, with an estimated increase of 1.25 percentage points in availability per 10% increase in Medicaid reimbursements (P = 0.03). No such association was observed in the private-insurance group. During the same periods, waiting times to a scheduled new-patient appointment remained stable over time in the two study groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides early evidence that increased Medicaid reimbursement to primary care providers, as mandated in the ACA, was associated with improved appointment availability for Medicaid enrollees among participating providers without generating longer waiting times.

Our objectives were to describe physician familiarity and knowledge with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) and to determine if knowledge is associated with support and endorsement of the ACA. Methods: We used a cross-sectional Internet-based survey of 559 physicians practicing in California. Primary outcomes were physician support and endorsement of ACA: (1) overall impact on the country (one item) and (2) perceived impact on physician’s medical practice (one item). The primary predictor was knowledge of the ACA as measured with 10 questions. Other measures included age, gender, race-ethnicity, specialty, political views, provision of direct care, satisfaction with the practice of medicine, and compensation type. Descriptive statistics and multiple variable regression models were calculated. Results: Respondents were 65% females, and the mean age was 54 years (+/- 9.7). Seventy-seven percent of physicians understood the ACA somewhat well/very well, and 59% endorsed the ACA, but 39% of physicians believed that health care reform will most likely hurt their practice. Primary care physicians were more likely to perceive that the new law will help their practice, compared to procedural specialties. Satisfaction with the practice of medicine, political affiliation, compensation type, and more knowledge of the health care law were independently associated with endorsement of the ACA. Conclusions: Endorsement of the ACA varied by specialty, knowledge, and satisfaction with the practice of medicine. © 2015, Society of Teachers of Family Medicine. All rights reserved."

Nonprofit hospitals can provide a unique resource to school districts by assisting in the timely completion of school-based screenings and meet requirements of the Affordable Care Act. This case study describes the collaboration between an academic medical center and a local school district to conduct school-based health screenings. Community Context: Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center and Penn State Hershey PRO Wellness Center collaborated with Lebanon School District to facilitate student health screenings, a need identified in part by a community health needs assessment. Methods: From June 2012 through February 2013, district-wide student health screenings were planned and implemented by teams of hospital nursing leadership, school district leadership, and school nurses. In fall 2013, students were screened through standardized procedures for height, weight, scoliosis, vision, and hearing. Outcomes: In 2 days, 3,105 students (67% of all students in the district) were screened. Letters explaining screening results were mailed to parents of all students screened. Debriefing meetings and follow-up surveys for the participating nurses provided feedback for future screenings. Interpretation: The 2-day collaborative screening event decreased the amount of time spent by school nurses in screening students throughout the year and allowed them more time in their role as school wellness champion. Additionally, parents found out early in the school year whether their child needed physician follow-up. Partnerships between school districts and hospitals to conduct student health screenings are a practical option for increasing outreach while satisfying community needs."

This study estimated nursing home admission patterns by race and ethnicity in a retrospective cohort of Medicare and Medicaid dually eligible individuals who enrolled in Medicaid HCBS programs. Study Design: We analyzed the 2006 Medicaid Analytic eXtract personal summary files from 19 states, and linked these data to nursing home Minimum Data Sets and other files. We used multivariable competing risk proportional hazard models to estimate 2-year risks of short-term and long-term nursing home admissions for black and Hispanic HCBS enrollees, compared with white enrollees. We also compared racial/ethnic differences in physical and cognitive impairments at the time of nursing home admissions. Results: Among 93,508 older (65 y and above) and new HCBS users, the 2-year long-term nursing home admission rates were 10.16% for blacks [n=18,000; hazard ratio (HR)=0.80, P<0.001 in multivariable regression] and 5.59% for Hispanics (n=13,786; HR=0.49, P<0.001), compared with 12.27% for whites. The 2-year short-term nursing home admission rates were 11.99% for blacks (HR=0.84, P<0.001 in multivariable regression) and 9.29% for Hispanics (HR=0.62, P<0.001), compared with 13.40% for whites. Black and Hispanic elders were more impaired than whites in physical and cognitive functions at both short-term and long-term nursing home admissions. Conclusions: Among dual-eligible older HCBS recipients, blacks and Hispanics tended to stay longer in their communities until a nursing home admission, and upon admission, are more impaired both physically and cognitively. These differences may suggest continued racial/ethnic disparities in access to nursing homes in addition to cultural differences in long-term care preferences. © 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

The cost for health services for diabetes care has increased 41% over the past 5 years. Despite escalating health expenditure, the United States continues to have higher rates of diabetes than many other developed countries. There is a need for health care reform in the United States not only in reducing health care costs but also in improving the quality of preventative care. This study presents the testing of a multilevel model investigating variables on the individual and state levels to develop a better understanding of the most important contextual pathways that can lead to providing older adults (50+) with type 2 diabetes with the recommended preventative quality care they require. The model was tested using a three-level repeated cross-sectional design with data from various existing data sources, using a national sample of 181,870 individuals aged 50 years and older. Results showed that differences in state health care systems contributed to inequitable access. Specifically, in a state where there was a higher percentage of adults 65 and older coupled with a shortage of health care professionals, the likelihood of receiving the recommended preventative quality care decreased. Also, older adults living in states with a higher percentage of people with diagnosed diabetes but with a lower-than-average annual per capita health care expenditure fared worse in receiving quality preventative care. Last, older adults in wealthy states with higher percentages of uninsured people had the lowest odds of receiving quality preventative care. Health care reform, similar to what is currently promoted by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, is recommended to improve the performance of all health care systems in all states. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."

Identifying and quantifying the factors contributing to these racial-ethnic disparities can help shape interventions and policies aimed at reducing these disparities. This study, for the first time, identified and quantified individual-level sociodemographic and health-related factors that contribute to racial-ethnic disparities in breast cancer screening using the nonlinear Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition method. Methods: Analysis of the retrospective pooled cross-sectional Medical Expenditure Panel Survey data from 2000 to 2010 was conducted. Women aged 40 years and older were included in the study. Logistic regressions were used to estimate racial-ethnic disparities in breast cancer screening. Nonlinear Blindera""Oaxaca decomposition method was used to identify and quantify the contribution of each individual-level factor toward racial-ethnic disparities. Results: Based on the unadjusted analyses, Hispanic women had lower odds of receiving mammogram screening (MS) (odds ratio [OR]: 0.74; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.69-0.80) and breast cancer screening (OR: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.70-0.81) as compared with NHW women. However, the relationship reversed in adjusted analyses, such that Hispanic women had higher odds of receiving MS (OR: 1.27; 95% CI: 1.16-1.40) and breast cancer screening (OR: 1.28; 95% CI: 1.17-1.40) as compared with NHW women. The Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition estimated that improving insurance status, access to care, education, and income will considerably increase screening rates among Hispanic women. Conclusions: The study projects that improving health care access and health education will considerably increase breast cancer screening compliance among Hispanic women. Policies like the Affordable Care Act, and patient navigation and health education interventions, might considerably reduce screening disparities in the Hispanic population. © 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc."

The objectives of this study were to determine patients' familiarity with colonoscopy quality measures (CQMs) and their influence on patient selection of a colonoscopist. METHODS: A prospective survey of patients before screening or surveillance colonoscopy at university hospital, community hospital, and ambulatory procedure center endoscopy units was performed from 2011 to 2012. RESULTS: Among the 417 participants, 20% (85/417) researched their physician's rating. The rates of familiarity with CQM were 88 % (353/402) for adequate bowel preparation, 30% (118/398) for adenoma detection rate (ADR), 26% (102/397) for cecal intubation rate, and 21% (82/394) for greater-than-6-min withdrawal time. Ninety-six percent (366/386) believed that colonoscopists' reporting of ADR to other physicians was important or very important. In selecting a colonoscopist, primary care provider referral was ranked as the first or second-most important of four factors in 87% (339/391). Even among patients who responded ""it is very important"" to report CQM to other doctors and patients, none ranked CQM as the most important factor in selecting a colonoscopist. CONCLUSIONS: Patient awareness of CQM, other than adequate bowel preparation, was low. Quality measure reporting is important to patients, but primary care provider referral was the most important factor in colonoscopist selection. This suggests that primary care providers, as well as patients, are important to include in educational strategies regarding quality metrics. © 2015 by the American College of Gastroenterology."

In promoting corporate religious exemptions from employment and consumer protections, litigants, scholars, and courts are resurrecting Lochner v. New York—a case symbolic of the courts’ widely criticized use of freedom of contract to strike down economic regulation at the turn of the last century. Today, in their interpretations of the First Amendment and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, courts replicate the commitment to private ordering and resistance to redistribution that were at the heart of Lochner. While this phenomenon is exemplified by Burwell v. Hobby Lobby, its reach is wider. The comparison to Lochner offers two insights overlooked in contemporary debates over business religious liberty. First, in resisting compliance with antidiscrimination laws, pharmacy regulations, and insurance mandates (most prominently, the Affordable Care Act’s contraceptive mandate), businesses make claims more reminiscent of market libertarianism than of religious freedom. In siding with these businesses, courts have begun to incorporate the premises of Lochner into religious liberty doctrine. In the contraceptive mandate litigation in particular, courts—from the trial level to the Supreme Court—defined a business’s right to free exercise of religion by reference to its ability to contract. They postulated private market ordering as a legally and economically neutral baseline and regulation as an unnecessary and unfair redistribution. Second, comparing business religious liberty doctrine to Lochner-era freedom of contract lays bare the implications for the regulatory state beyond contraception and same-sex marriage. While scholars have recognized a link between Lochner and the Free Speech Clause, this Article establishes that free exercise has taken on a similar role with potential to undermine the regulation of business more broadly. © 2015, Columbia Law Review Association.

However, the proportion of smokers with COPD who have received physician advice to quit smoking is unknown. The purpose of this study is to assess the prevalence of receipt of smoking-cessation advice among adults with COPD and explore factors predicting advice receipt. Methods This study employed nationally representative data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS), collected in 2008-2011 on adults aged 20 years. Logistic regression models were conducted to estimate the likelihood of receiving provider advice. Data were analyzed in 2014. Results Four percent (95% CI=3.8%, 4.2%) of adults reported being diagnosed with COPD. Among them, 38.5% (95% CI=36.1%, 40.8%) were current smokers. Among those who had seen a physician in the past year, 85.6% (95% CI=83.1%, 88.0%) were advised to quit smoking. Logistic regression revealed negative associations between receipt of smoking-cessation advice and having fewer healthcare visits (AOR=0.41, 95% CI=0.23, 0.72); being uninsured (AOR=0.43, 95% CI=0.22, 0.83); having no usual source of care (AOR=0.39, 95% CI=0.19, 0.80); and having no comorbid chronic diseases (AOR=0.50, 95% CI=0.29, 0.85). Conclusions Having no usual source of care and no health insurance are major barriers to receiving smoking-cessation advice among patients with COPD. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act has the potential to increase advice receipt in this high-risk population by expanding health insurance coverage and increasing the number of people with a usual source of care. © 2015 American Journal of Preventive Medicine."

However, it is not known what time point after death offers the most reliable responses. Objectives To examine the stability of bereaved family members' survey responses when administered three, six, and nine months after hospice patient death. Methods Bereaved family members from six geographically diverse hospices were interviewed three, six, and nine months after patient death. All respondents completed a core survey. Those whose family member died at home, in a freestanding inpatient unit, or in a nursing home also completed a site-specific module. Stability was based on top-box scoring of each item with kappa statistics, and multivariable regression models were used to assess directionality and predictors of change. To analyze the effects of grief, we assessed response stability among respondents at least one SD from the mean change in grief between three and six months. Results We had 1532 surveys (536 three-month surveys, 529 six-month surveys, and 467 nine-month surveys) returned by 643 respondents (average age 61.7 years, 17.4% black, and 50.5% a child respondent) about hospice decedents (55.3% females, average age 78.6 years, 57.0% noncancer, and 40.0% at home). The average kappa for core items between three and nine months was 0.54 (range 0.42-0.74), 0.58 (0.41-0.69) for home-specific items, and 0.54 (0.39-0.63) for nursing home. Even among individuals demonstrating large grief changes, core items demonstrated moderate to high stability over time.

Several prevention-related recommendations issued by the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) are covered under the ACA. State cancer plans often provide prevention strategies, but whether these strategies correspond to federal evidence-based recommendations is unclear. The objective of this article is to assess whether federal evidence-based recommendations, including those covered under the ACA, are included in the Maryland Comprehensive Cancer Control Plan (MCCCP). Methods A total of 19 federal recommendations pertaining to cancer prevention and control were identified. Inclusion of federal cancer-related recommendations by USPSTF, CDC, and ACIP in the MCCCP's goals, objectives, and strategies was examined. Results Nine of the federal recommendations were issued after the MCCCP's publication. MCCCP recommendations corresponded completely with 4 federal recommendations and corresponded only partially with 3. Reasons for partial correspondence included specification of less restrictive at-risk populations or different intervention implementers. Three federal recommendations were not mentioned in the MCCCP's goals, objectives, and strategies. Conclusion Many cancer-related federal recommendations were released after the MCCCP's publication and therefore do not appear in the most current version. We recommend that the results of this analysis be considered in the update of the MCCCP. Our findings underscore the need for a periodic scan for changes to federal recommendations and for adjusting state policies and programs to correspond with federal recommendations, as appropriate for Marylanders."

Objective: To present the development of the Senior Care Services Scale (SCSS) through: (1) identification of hospital services relevant to the care of older adults; (2) development of a taxonomy classifying these services; and (3) description of prevalence, geographic variation, and trends in service provision in US hospitals over time. Design, Setting, and Participants: A retrospective cohort study of US hospitals in 1999 and 2006 rounds of American Hospital Association Annual Survey of Hospitals (n = 4998 and 4831 hospitals, respectively). Exploratory factor analysis was used to create the SCSS, and confirmatory factor analysis was used to examine services over time. The paper reports prevalence of services nationwide. Results: The SCSS consisted of 2 service groups: (1) Inpatient Specialty Care (IP): geriatrics, palliative care, psychiatric geriatrics, pain management, social work, case management, rehabilitation, and hospice; and (2) Postacute Community Care (PA): skilled nursing, intermediate care, other long-term care, assisted living, retirement housing, adult day care, and home health services. Over time, hospitals offered more IP services and fewer PA services. The distribution of services did not mirror the distribution of where older adults reside in the United States. Conclusions: The development of the SCSS provides important information about senior care services before the passage of the Affordable Care Act. The apparent mismatch of hospital services and demographic trends suggests that many US hospitals may not provide a seamless continuum of care for an increasing population of older adults.

Yet Lindsey Leininger and Helen Levy begin by pointing out that access to care plays a smaller role than we might think, and that many other factors, such as those discussed elsewhere in this issue, strongly influence children’s health. Nonetheless, they find that, on the whole, policies to improve access indeed improve children’s health, with the caveat that context plays a big role—medical care “matters more at some times, or for some children, than others.” Focusing on studies that can plausibly show a causal effect between policies to increase access and better health for children, and starting from an economic framework, they consider both the demand for and the supply of health care. On the demand side, they examine what happens when the government expands public insurance programs (such as Medicaid), or when parents are offered financial incentives to take their children to preventive appointments. On the supply side, they look at what happens when public insurance programs increase the payments that they offer to health-care providers, or when health-care providers are placed directly in schools where children spend their days. They also examine how the Affordable Care Act is likely to affect children’s access to medical care. Leininger and Levy reach three main conclusions. First, despite tremendous progress in recent decades, not all children have insurance coverage, and immigrant children are especially vulnerable. Second, insurance coverage alone doesn’t guarantee access to care, and insured children may still face barriers to getting the care they need. Finally, as this issue of Future of Children demonstrates, access to care is only one of the factors that policy makers should consider as they seek to make the nation’s children healthier. © 2015 by The Trustees of Princeton University."

A continued improvement in screening requires identification of existing barriers and implementation of interventions to address barriers. Methods: The state of Kentucky added a question to the 2012 Kentucky Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System survey for respondents aged 50 years or older who answered no to ever having been screened for colorectal cancer by colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy to assess the reasons why respondents had not been screened. Combined responses constituted 4 categories: attitudes and beliefs, health care provider and health care systems barriers, cost, and other. Prevalence estimates for barriers were calculated by using raking weights and were stratified by race/ethnicity, sex, education, income, and health insurance coverage. Logistic regression estimated odds ratios for barriers to screening. Results: The most common barriers in all areas were related to attitudes and beliefs, followed by health care provider and systems, and cost. Non-Hispanic whites and respondents with more than a high school education were more likely to choose attitudes and beliefs as a barrier than were non-Hispanic blacks and those with less than a high school education. Respondents with low incomes and with no insurance were significantly more likely to select cost as a barrier. No significant associations were observed between demographic variables and the selection of a health care provider and a health care system. Conclusion: Barriers related to education, race/ethnicity, income, and insurance coverage should be considered when designing interventions. Expansion of Medicaid and implementation of the Affordable Care Act in Kentucky could have an impact on reducing these barriers."

With reduced payment penalties for hospitals with excessive readmissions, hospitals have increased their focus on managing post discharge care. With the emphasis on prevention and proactive care, integrated approaches that have the ability to collect relevant data from patients, process it efficiently and timely and predict risk patterns in advance and enable seamless collaboration between the patients and the care team is required. This allows care teams to proactively manage the care of the patient and limit complications and readmissions. Internet of things enabled collaborative cloud based e-health is evolving as one of the key transformation approaches in helping to address the 30 day readmission avoidance efforts. While the sensors provide critical data, there are significant constraints in terms of processing, power, storage and overall context. The power and capabilities of the cloud can augment the local visibility of sensors by providing capabilities that the sensors lack. In this work, we define these capabilities as the five P's: Provisioning, Policy Management, Processing, Protection and Prediction. We argue that by bringing these elements together, the e-health architecture is able to take the data from sensors securely and transfer it to the cloud and generate insights and actions that help improve healthcare outcomes in a timely manner. The Cloud management plays a critical role in ensuring the integrity and availability of vital information. The blind spots in the unavailability of data or compromised data can result in missed opportunities for proactive care; ours proposed architecture ensures data availability, processing availability and integrity and thus is very important in a 30 day readmission context. © 2014 ICST."

Method: We used workforce survey data for the years 2008 to 2012 from the Health Professions Tracking Service to analyze the cancer care workforce supply in the state of Nebraska. The supply of cancer care providers was analyzed over the 5-year period on the basis of age, sex, specialty, and practice location; distribution of work hours for cancer care physicians was analyzed for 2012. Results: From 2008 to 2012, there was a 3.3% increase in the number of cancer care physicians. Majority of the cancer care physicians (82.5%), NPs (81.1%), and PAs (80%) reported working in urban counties, whereas approximately half of the state's population resides in rural counties (47%). Compared with the national distribution, Nebraska has a lower proportion of medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, and pediatric hematologists/oncologists. The gap between the number of cancer care physicians age ≥ 64 years and the number younger than 40 years is slowly closing in Nebraska, with an increase in those age ≥ 64 years. Conclusion: Increasing cancer incidence and improved access to cancer care through the Affordable Care Act could increase demand for cancer care workers. Policymakers and legislators should consider a range of policies based on the best available data on the supply of cancer care providers and the demand for cancer care.

We sought to investigate use, spending, and patient cost-sharing for Medicare beneficiaries using biologic drugs for RA, comparing patients exposed to minimal cost-sharing because of a Part D low-income subsidy (LIS) to those facing substantial out-of-pocket costs (OOP). Methods We performed a retrospective, nationwide study using 2009 Medicare claims for a 5% random sample of beneficiaries with RA who had at least 1 RA drug dispensed. We analyzed biologic drug utilization and costs across the Part B (medical benefit) and Part D (pharmacy benefit) programs by LIS status using multinomial regression. We also projected OOP costs as the Affordable Care Act (ACA) mandates closure of the Part D coverage gap by 2020. Results Among 6,932 beneficiaries, 1,812 (26.1%) received a biologic drug. LIS beneficiaries were significantly more likely to obtain Part D home-administered biologics (relative risk ratio [RRR] 2.98, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 2.50-3.56), while non-LIS beneficiaries were less likely to receive Part D biologic agents (RRR 0.58, 95% CI 0.48-0.69). OOP costs in Part D were lower, as expected, for LIS beneficiaries (72 versus 3,751 per year for non-LIS). Non-LIS beneficiaries had lower costs for Part B facility-administered biologic agents (range 0-2,584) than for Part D home-administered biologic agents. ACA reforms will narrow OOP differences between Part D and B for non-LIS beneficiaries. Conclusion In contrast to LIS beneficiaries who receive mostly Part D home-administered biologic DMARDs, nonsubsidized beneficiaries have significant cost-based incentives to obtain facility-administered biologic DMARDs through Part B. The ACA will result in only slightly lower costs for Part D biologic drugs for these beneficiaries. © 2015, American College of Rheumatology."

The authors report 36-month outcomes of the paraprofessional-delivered Family Spirit home-visiting intervention for American Indian teen mothers and children. Method: Expectant American Indian teens (N=322, mean age=18.1 years) from four southwestern reservation communities were randomly assigned to the Family Spirit intervention plus optimized standard care or optimized standard care alone. Maternal and child outcomes were evaluated at 28 and 36 weeks gestation and 2, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36 months postpartum. Results: At baseline the mothers had high rates of substance use (>84%), depressive symptoms (>32%), dropping out of school (>57%), and residential instability (51%). Study retention was ≥83%. From pregnancy to 36 months postpartum, mothers in the intervention group had significantly greater parenting knowledge (effect size=0.42) and parental locus of control (effect size=0.17), fewer depressive symptoms (effect size=0.16) and externalizing problems (effect size=0.14), and lower past month use ofmarijuana (odds ratio=0.65) and illegal drugs (odds ratio=0.67). Children in the intervention group had fewer externalizing (effect size=0.23), internalizing (effect size=0.23), and dysregulation (effect size=0.27) problems. Conclusions: The paraprofessional home-visiting intervention promoted effective parenting, reduced maternal risks, and improved child developmental outcomes in the U.S. population subgroup with the fewest resources and highest behavioral health disparities. The methods and results can inform federal efforts to disseminate and sustain evidencebased home-visiting interventions in at-risk populations."

Community health workers are effective in insuring uninsured children, and parent mentors (PMs) in improving asthmatic children's outcomes. It is unknown, however, whether a training program can result in PMs acquiring knowledge/skills to insure uninsured children. The study aim was to determine whether a PM training program results in improved knowledge/skills regarding insuring uninsured minority children. Methods Minority parents in a primary-care clinic who already had Medicaid/Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP)-covered children were selected as PMs, attending a 2-day training session addressing 9 topics. A 33-item pretraining test assessed knowledge/skills regarding Medicaid/CHIP, the application process, and medical homes. A 46-item posttest contained the same 33 pretest items (ordered differently) and 13 Likert-scale questions on training satisfaction. Results All 15 PMs were female and nonwhite, 60% were unemployed, and the mean annual income was $20,913. After training, overall test scores (0-100 scale) significantly increased, from a mean of 62 (range 39-82) to 88 (range 67-100) (P <.01), and the number of wrong answers decreased (mean reduction 8; P <.01). Significant improvements occurred in 6 of 9 topics, and 100% of PMs reported being very satisfied (86%) or satisfied (14%) with the training. Preliminary data indicate PMs are significantly more effective than traditional Medicaid/CHIP outreach/enrollment in insuring uninsured minority children. Conclusions A PM training program resulted in significant improvements in knowledge and skills regarding outreach to and enrollment of uninsured, Medicaid/CHIP-eligible children, with high levels of satisfaction with the training. This PM training program might be a useful model for training Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act navigators. Copyright © 2015 by Academic Pediatric Association."

American Academy of Pediatrics and Affordable Care Act call for SU screening and prevention. The Youth Risk Index (YRI) was tested as a screening tool for having initiated and propensity to initiate SU before high school (which forecasts SU disorder). YRI was hypothesized to have good to excellent psychometrics, feasibility and stakeholder acceptability for use during well-child check-ups. Design: A high-risk longitudinal design with two cross-sectional replication samples, ages 9-13 was used. Analyses included receiver operating characteristics and regression analyses. Participants: A one-year longitudinal sample (N= 640) was used for YRI derivation. Replication samples were a cross-sectional sample (N= 345) and well-child check-up patients (N= 105) for testing feasibility, validity and acceptability as a screening tool. Results: YRI has excellent test-retest reliability and good sensitivity and specificity for concurrent and one-year-later SU (odds ratios. = 7.44, CI. = 4.3-13.0) and conduct problems (odds ratios. = 7.33, CI. = 3.9-13.7). Results were replicated in both cross-sectional samples. Well-child patients, parents and pediatric staff rated YRI screening as important, acceptable, and a needed service. Conclusions: Identifying at-risk youth prior to age 13 could reap years of opportunity to intervene before onset of SU disorder. Most results pertained to YRI's association with concurrent or recent past risky behaviors; further replication ought to specify its predictive validity, especially adolescent-onset risky behaviors. YRI well identifies youth at risk for SU and conduct problems prior to high school, is feasible and valid for screening during well-child check-ups, and is acceptable to stakeholders. © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd."

More than nine million Medicare beneficiaries are also enrolled in the Medicaid program. Sixty percent are age 65 years and older. Many dual-eligible patients and their caregivers experience difficulties navigating the health care system. The division of responsibility and funding across the Medicare and Medicaid programs only intensifies these problems. Prior to the passage of the ACA, special needs plans, authorized in 2003, focused on specific subtypes of dual eligible beneficiaries with the intent to integrate the financing and delivery of care for the full range of health care needs. The Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly stands out as a successful example of a seamlessly integrated program that brings together Medicare and Medicaid benefits into one delivery system. The ACA established the Federal Coordinated Health Care Office (FCHCO). In 2011, the FCHCO began the Medicare-Medicaid Financial Alignment Demonstration. The program allows state Medicaid offices to develop innovative approaches to improve the coordination of care for the dual eligible population, while adding efficiencies and incentives that will reduce the cost of care. At the start of 2014, eight States had completed signed agreements with CMS to initiate demonstrations.

The authors argue that it is wise to anticipate demand for suicide-specific evidence-based treatments (EBTs) moving forward. The authors outline current best practices in clinical suicide prevention, and describe the Collaborative Assessment and Management of Suicidality (CAMS) as an example of how a suicide-focussed EBT can adapt to some predicted changes. Design/methodology/approach – This conceptual paper first presents an overview of the main effects of ACA within the behavioral health care (BHC) system. Next, the authors review contemporary approaches to the treatment of suicidal patients, as well as current treatment limitations. The authors present CAMS as a model of a suicide-focussed EBT that holds promise for use in the post-ACA era. To close, the authors discuss anticipated changes in suicide treatment and illustrate that CAMS is adaptable to these changes. Findings – ACA mandates several changes: implementation of EBTs, better preventative care, integrated treatment models, and improved healthcare administration. A central effect of ACA in BHC is the increased use of EBTs. Therefore effective EBTs for suicide prevention are described.

Telemedicine uses communication technologies in prevention, disease management, home health care, long-term (chronic) care, emergency medicine, and many other applications including audiology. Telemedicine is being adopted and integrated into the health care enterprise at an exponential rate and it is often difficult to keep up with all of these changes. Other key drivers such as the Affordable Care Act and other federal health care initiatives are pushing the adoption of telemedicine and catalyzing a flood of interest in telemedicine, telehealth, and m-Health. Purpose: This paper provides an overview of telehealth models and will describe methodologies as they pertain to clinical practice. The goal is to provide the principles behind the practice of telemedicine and how they can be applied to teleaudiology programs. There is a very large body of evidence supporting the benefits and utility of telehealth in terms of technology, economic value, and impact on patients. However, there are still barriers to acceptance, so we must address these challenges and involve all relevant stakeholders if telehealth is to become an integral part of the health care system. Clinical guidelines for telemedicine developed by experts who are practicing it on a daily basis is one way to help overcome these barriers, so attention will be devoted to a discussion of current guidelines. Conclusions: Telemedicine is not a unique clinical specialty, but rather uses telecommunication technologies to reach out to patients to reduce barriers to care in underserved areas, improve patient care and accessibility to specialists, decrease professional isolation in rural areas, help medical practitioners expand their practice reach, and save patients from having to travel or be transported to receive high quality care."

The Affordable Care Act includes screening and brief counseling for IPV as part of required free preventive services for women. Thus, IPV screening and counseling must be implemented safely and effectively throughout the healthcare delivery system. Health professional education is one strategy for increasing screening and counseling in healthcare settings, but studies on improving screening and counseling for other health conditions highlight the critical role of making changes within the healthcare delivery system to drive desired improvements in clinician screening practices and health outcomes. This article outlines a systems approach to the implementation of IPV screening and counseling, with a focus on integrated health and advocacy service delivery to support identification and interventions, use of electronic health record (EHR) tools, and cross-sector partnerships. Practice and policy recommendations include (1) ensuring staff and clinician training in effective, client-centered IPV assessment that connects patients to support and services regardless of disclosure; (2) supporting enhancement of EHRs to prompt appropriate clinical care for IPV and facilitate capturing more detailed and standardized IPV data; and (3) integrating IPV care into quality and meaningful use measures. Research directions include studies across various health settings and populations, development of quality measures and patient-centered outcomes, and tests of multilevel approaches to improve the uptake and consistent implementation of evidence-informed IPV screening and counseling guidelines. © Copyright 2015, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2015."

Despite this mandate, few data existed on generic conversion of immunosuppressant medications with narrow therapeutic troughs. Methods A retrospective analysis of our initial experience with generic tacrolimus (n = 39) was performed using a control cohort from our renal transplant database. A rejection and cost analysis was performed using a consecutive 2-year prior cohort (n = 159) as a control to determine the effect of generic conversion on tacrolimus a narrow therapeutic index immunosuppressant medication. Results During the first year after transplantation, the generic group had a greater drug variability (20% ± change in trough levels) that required more dosage adjustments (5.42 vs 3.59 drug dosage changes; P =.038) to obtain a stable dose, required increased number of intravenous magnesium infusions (4.95 vs 1.68 infusions; P =.001), and incurred a greater incidence of rejection (23.1% vs 10.2%; P =.024). A yearly institutional cost was evaluated against a negotiated $18,000/yearly central pharmacy cost savings compared with a $652,862 institutional cost to treat unanticipated rejections. Conclusion Programmatic conversion from brand to generic tacrolimus resulted in increased drug variability, a greater incidence of magnesium wasting, and more episodes of rejection, leading to increases in institutional costs of care. This government-driven attempt at cost containment may be applicable to noncritical medications such as antibiotics and antihypertensives, but this policy should be reconsidered for narrow therapeutic index medications, such as tacrolimus and other immunosuppressant medications. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Recent data indicate that as many as 24% of Medicare patients require readmission after vascular surgery, although the rate of readmission after limited digital amputations has not been specifically examined. The present study was therefore undertaken to define the rate of unplanned readmission among patients after digital amputations and to identify the factors associated with these readmissions to allow the clinician to implement strategies to reduce readmission rates in the future. Methods The electronic medical and billing records of all patients undergoing minor amputations (defined as toe or transmetatarsal amputations using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, codes) from January 2000 through July 2012 were retrospectively reviewed. Data were collected for procedure- and hospital-related variables, level of amputation, length of stay, time to readmission, and level of reamputation. Patient demographics included hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, smoking history, and history of myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, peripheral arterial disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cerebrovascular accident. Results Minor amputations were performed in 717 patients (62.2% male), including toe amputations in 565 (72.8%) and transmetatarsal amputations in 152 (19.5%). Readmission occurred in 100 patients (13.9%), including 28 (3.9%) within 30 days, 28 (3.9%) between 30 and 60 days, and 44 (6.1%) >60 days after the index amputation. Multivariable analysis revealed that elective admission (P <.001), peripheral arterial disease (P <.001), and chronic renal insufficiency (P =.001) were associated with readmission. The reasons for readmission were infection (49%), ischemia (29%), nonhealing wound (19%), and indeterminate (4%). Reamputation occurred in 95 (95%) of the readmitted patients, including limb amputation in 64 (64%) of the patients (below knee in 58, through knee in 2, and above knee in 4). Conclusions Readmission after minor amputation was associated with limb amputation in the majority of cases. This study identified a number of nonmodifiable patient factors that are associated with an increased risk of readmission. Whereas efforts to reduce unplanned hospital readmissions are laudable, payers and regulators should consider these observations in defining unacceptable rates of readmission. Further, although beyond the scope of this study, it is not unreasonable to assume that pressure to reduce readmission rates in the population of patients with extensive comorbidity may induce practitioners to undertake amputation at a higher level initially to minimize the risk of readmission for reamputation and associated financial penalties and thus deprive the patient the chance for limb salvage. © 2015 Society for Vascular Surgery."

Yet most individuals with drug use disorders have never been treated, though they often seek medical treatment in primary care. The purpose of this study was to examine the baseline characteristics of people presenting in primary care with a range of problem drug use severity to identify their clinical needs. Methods: We examined sociodemographic characteristics, medical and psychiatric comorbidities, drug use severity, social and legal problems, and service utilization for 868 patients with drug problems. These patients were recruited from primary care clinics in a medical safety net setting. Based on Drug Abuse Screening Test results, individuals were categorized as having low, intermediate, or substantial/ severe drug use severity. Results: Patients with substantial/severe drug use severity had serious drug use (opiates, stimulants, sedatives, intravenous drugs); high levels of homelessness (50%), psychiatric comorbidity (69%), and arrests for serious crimes (24%); and frequent use of expensive emergency department and inpatient hospitals. Patients with low drug use severity were primarily users of marijuana, with little reported use of other drugs, less psychiatric comorbidity, and more stable lifestyles. Patients with intermediate drug use severity fell in between the substantial/severe and low drug use severity subgroups on most variables. Conclusions: Patients with the highest drug use severity are likely to require specialized psychiatric and substance abuse care, in addition to ongoing medical care that is equipped to address the consequences of severe/substantial drug use, including intravenous drug use. Because of their milder symptoms, patients with low drug use severity may benefit from a collaborative care model that integrates psychiatric and substance abuse care in the primary care setting. Patients with intermediate drug use severity may benefit from selective application of interventions suggested for patients with the highest and lowest drug use severity. Primary care safety net clinics are in a key position to serve patients with problem drug use by developing a range of responses that are locally effective and that may also inform national efforts to establish patient-centered medical homes and to implement the Affordable Care Act."

Although information about the number and distribution of nurse practitioners is known, there is little information about the practice characteristics of PCNPs. The purpose of this study was to identify demographic and practice characteristics of PCNPs and compare these characteristics with primary care physicians (PCMDs). Methods: From November 23, 2011, to April 9, 2012, we conducted a national postal mail survey of 972 clinicians (467 PCNPs and 505 PCMDs). Questionnaire domains included compensation and billing practices; characteristics of patients treated; PCNPs' use of their own National Provider Identification number to bill services; how PCNPs spend their time; clinical and nonclinical activities performed; and whether PCNPs have privileges to admit, round on (i.e., oversee the care provided to) patients, and write orders independently of physicians. The response rate was 61.2%. Discussion: PCNPs are more likely than PCMDs to practice in urban and rural areas, provide care in a wider range of community settings, and treat Medicaid recipients and other vulnerable populations. Not only do most PCNPs work with PCMDs, but also the majority of both clinicians believe that increasing the supply of PCNPs will result in greater collaboration and team practice. Although PCNPs and PCMDs deliver similar services and spend their time in nearly identical ways, PCNPs work less hours and see fewer patients, and only a handful of PCNPs have their salary adjusted for productivity and quality performance. PCNPs cite government and local regulations as impeding their capacity to admit and round on patients in hospitals and long-term care facilities and write treatment orders without a physician cosignature. Conclusions: Significant differences in demographic and practice characteristics exist between PCNPs and PCMDs. Whether working independently or with PCMDs, increasing the number of PCNPs can be expected to expand access to primary care, particularly for vulnerable populations, and for those gaining access to health insurance through the Affordable Care Act. © 2015 Elsevier Inc."

As such, agencies routinely make decisions about when to promulgate regulations and when to enforce statutory requirements against parties who violate the law. During the 113th Congress, the Obama Administration announced that certain federal agencies would not enforce specific aspects of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) for a period of time in order to allow the public to further prepare for proper compliance with the law in the future. This has led to numerous questions regarding how courts treat administrative delays of regulatory programs. When can a suit be brought to force the agency to apply the law? It is important to distinguish between two distinct types of agency delays: (1) delays resulting from when an agency fails to meet a statutory deadline for promulgating rules or completing particular adjudications, and (2) affirmative decisions to withhold enforcement of a provision of law on the public at large. The former arises in a scenario in which Congress has enacted a statute that expressly requires an agency to take a specific action by a certain date that the agency fails to meet. Because agencies can often struggle to meet tight congressional deadlines imposed by laws, courts have established a balancing test, known as the TRAC test, to determine whether the agency should be compelled to take action. The second type of delay occurs in a scenario in which an agency refuses, for a period of time, to enforce a statutory prohibition or requirement that Congress has imposed on third parties. This type of delay is generally implemented by announcing a period of non-enforcement during which the agency will not pursue or punish noncompliance with the law. Courts determine whether these delays are reviewable in court by following the Supreme Court's holding in Heckler v. Chaney. This report will discuss the general legal principles applied in determining whether administrative delays are reviewable in court in these two different contexts and then address whether the procedures outlined in the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) are applicable to these delays. © 2015 Nova Science Publishers, Inc."

But innovation isn't easy. There are many roadblocks beyond those of discovery and development. The complicated and conflicting dynamics of politics, perspectives on healthcare economics, of friction between payers, providers, manufacturers, and regulators, the battle for better patient education, and the need for a more forceful and factual debate over the value of innovation all create the need for a more balanced and robust debate. The public policy essays in this paper present some of the key obstructions to maximizing healthcare innovation. The Center for Medicine in the Public Interest is dedicated to addressing these problems head-on and providing practical opportunities to overcome them. Specifically: · The importance of understanding and rewarding incremental innovation. · The price/value debate. Rather than focusing on the short-term costs of healthcare, what are the long-term benefits to both patients and society? We will examine this issue through the lens of the Solvadi debate. · Value-based insurance design. How a more personalized approach to reimbursement matches up well with advances in personalized medicine. · The dynamic and distressing link between co-pays and outcomes and how this relationship must be understood and recalibrated. · The urgent need for transparency in insurance choices within the Affordable Care Act in order to provide the right medicine to the right patient at the right time in a transparent and affordable manner. · How to reach best clinical practice more swiftly through electronic preauthorization and the increasing empowerment of physicians. · Addressing the problem of medication compliance through innovative approaches such as apps and more user-friendly patient education. · How ""the story of innovation"" can be more clearly and powerfully communicated to various constituencies so that we can narrow the ""misperception gap."" · Rather than playing the ""blame game,"" how we can advance healthcare innovation by working together to advance the public good."

This project claims that in so doing, courts seek to preserve important constitutional interests. On the one hand, based on our understanding of rights possession, rights revocation implicates autonomy interests of the rights holder to a greater degree than a failure to afford rights at the outset. On the other hand, the institution revoking rights is more likely to exhibit impermissible behavior when taking away rather than failing to provide the right. This is the first of two articles, and tackles the first of the project's claims. It examines the autonomy interests of the rights holder that are implicated in rights revocation. It relies on philosophical understandings of ownership, backed by empirical research, to argue that our identities and indeed, our ability to think of ourselves as separate beings apart from the collective, are partially based on what we possess at a given point in time. The rights we possess both allow us to do things that aid in our flourishing and allow us to conceive of ourselves as individuals. Important legal concepts, such as the vested rights doctrine, among others, rely on this understanding of rights. However, the notion of rights, possession, and revocation are all constructed and subject to contestation. Courts and other institutional actors often face adversaries making (conflicting) rights claims. They must determine when a change in rights allocation is a rights revocation or a restoration of the status quo ante. In taking sides, courts and legislatures adopt rights revocation/restoration frames, claiming that the winners have rights that are being restored, and that losers never had rights to begin with, or that their rights existed temporarily subject to correction. In so doing, institutional actors also shore up their own legitimacy, often at the cost of each other. This dynamic provides an insight, not just into the work that rights do in constructing individuals, but also in developing institutional legitimacy. It shows how institutions themselves exploit rights claims in order to-consciously or not-further their own agendas."

Sebelius, the Supreme Court held that the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate violated the Commerce Clause but upheld the mandate under the Taxing Power. While the Court's decision has radically foreclosed congressional action under the Commerce Clause, it has allowed congressional authority under the Taxing Power to expand beyond the Commerce Clause. This departure from previous Supreme Court jurisprudence is significant. There has been much debate about how far congressional power under the Commerce Clause should extend. This Comment will make only a modest claim: regardless of your position on the Commerce Clause, the Court should treat congressional authority over the states the same under both the Commerce Clause and the Taxing Power. Because the power to tax can be used in a functionally identical way to regulating conduct, Congress can simply bypass limits on the Commerce Clause by using taxes. My claim that the Taxing Power should track the Commerce Clause is based on the text, structure, and history of the Constitution, as well as the Court's Taxing Power jurisprudence. I will argue that the Court's jurisprudence on the limits of the Taxing Power converges on two prominent themes: (1) subject matter that is reserved for the states, and (2) the extent of coercion or inducement of the tax in question. While some have questioned whether the Court, rather than another political branch, should be the one to decide, I will argue that judicial review of this and other federalism questions is necessary. I will situate my argument within the relevant academic literature, which is particularly on point for the distinction between taxes and penalties within the context of the Taxing Power and Commerce Clause. Drawing from this material, I will propose a doctrinal test for defining the limits of the Taxing Power. This test will presume that taxes that diverge from the Commerce Clause are unlawful unless rebutted after evaluating three criteria: (1) whether the exaction raises revenue, (2) whether the exaction is coercive, and (3) whether the subject matter in question belongs to the states. Lastly, I will apply the proposed test to hypothetical examples to demonstrate its contours, strengths, and weaknesses. © 2015 California Law Review, Inc."

Therefore, there is a critical need to improve the quality of care transitions among ED patients from ED to outpatient services. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of systematic implementation of a pharmacistled patient-centered approach to medication therapy management and reconciliation service (MRS) in the ED on patient utilization of available health care services. METHODS: A single institution prospective randomized cohort study with 90-day postvisit observation randomized patients into 2 groups: (1) medication therapy management reconciliation service following a patient-centered approach (MRS) or (2) usual care provided by the institution (non-MRS). To align patient enrollment with availability of other primary care services, subjects were enrolled during weekday daytime hours. Data for the 90 days before and after the index ED visit were matched in all analyses. Generalized estimating equations evaluated any primary care (PC), urgent care (UC), and ED visits during the 90 days post-index ED visit, adjusted by age and sex and weighted by survival time. Generalized linear models evaluated the average number of ED visits during that period, adjusted by age and sex and weighted by survival time. Data were analyzed for all adult patients (ADLTS), aged ≥ 18 years, and the subpopulation taking 1 or more prescribed daily medication at the time of the index ED visit (ADLTS1+)-the patients expected to receive greatest benefit from an MRS program. RESULTS: ADLTS MRS patients were 1.9 more likely than non-MRS patients to visit their PC providers (mean difference 0.15, P < 0.001). Similarly, ADLTS1+ MRS patients were 1.5 times more likely to visit their PC providers (mean difference 0.10, P = 0.026). Although ADLT MRS patients were less likely to visit the UC, this was not significant. However, ADLTS1+ MRS patients were significantly less likely than non-MRS patients (OR = 0.5, 95% CI = 0.3-0.9) to visit the UC. No significant difference was seen in ED visits. CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of a patient-centered approach to medication therapy management and reconciliation improved the odds of patients visiting their PC providers, a positive first step in transitioning patients toward an appropriate use of PC services. © 2015, Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy."

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA, P.L. 111-148 as amended) established 133% of the federal poverty level (FPL) (effectively 138% of FPL with an income disregard of 5% of FPL) as the new mandatory minimum Medicaid income eligibility level for most nonelderly individuals. On June 28, 2012, the United States Supreme Court issued its decision in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, finding that the enforcement mechanism for the ACA Medicaid expansion violated the Constitution, which effectively made the ACA Medicaid expansion optional for states. If a state accepts the ACA Medicaid expansion funds, it must abide by the new expansion coverage rules. For instance, modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) counting rules are used for determining eligibility for the ACA Medicaid expansion population, and individuals covered under the ACA Medicaid expansion are required to receive alternative benefit plan (ABP) coverage. The ACA provides different federal Medicaid matching rates for the individuals who will gain Medicaid coverage through the ACA Medicaid expansion. The federal government's share of most Medicaid expenditures is determined according to the federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP) rate, but exceptions to the regular FMAP rate have been made for certain states, situations, populations, providers, and services. The ACA adds a few FMAP exceptions for the ACA Medicaid expansion: the ""newly eligible"" FMAP rate, the ""expansion state"" FMAP rate, and the additional FMAP increase for certain expansion states. On January 1, 2014, when the ACA Medicaid expansion went into effect, 24 states and the District of Columbia had the ACA Medicaid expansion included as part of their Medicaid programs. Michigan implemented the expansion on April 1, 2014, and New Hampshire plans to implement the expansion on July 1, 2014. Most states implementing the ACA Medicaid expansion will do so through an expansion of their current Medicaid program. However, some states are implementing the expansion through an alternative health care delivery method, namely premium assistance. State decisions not to implement the ACA Medicaid expansion could have implications for low-income individuals, large employers with lowwage workers, and hospitals. For example, most uninsured individuals with incomes under 100% of FPL will likely remain uninsured, and large employers with low-wage workers might have greater exposure to employer penalties included in the ACA. Also, Medicaid DSH allotments will be reduced by the same across the nation whether or not states implement the expansion. © 2015 Nova Science Publishers, Inc."

Unfortunately, although the orthopaedic literature is replete with clinical outcomes studies, there is still a paucity of meaningful clinical outcomes data that are free from bias. It is possible that orthopaedic procedures may be among the most cost-effective medical treatments for the aging population. However, it is only through the collection of patient-generated outcomes data in prospective randomized and observational studies that orthopaedic surgery can be shown to provide high value (defined as high-quality outcomes at a relatively low cost) to society. The burden of musculoskeletal disease in the U.S. is high; nearly half of all adults describe themselves as having a chronic musculoskeletal condition, and approximately one-quarter of all health-care dollars are spent treating musculoskeletal disease. For this reason, treatment for osteoarthritis, the costliest condition in the elderly population, has drawn great scrutiny from insurers and the government. In the absence of clinical outcomes data that prove the value of orthopaedic interventions, there will be pressure to reduce payments or even deny treatments for these conditions if they are perceived to be too expensive or lack outcomes data supporting their use. Multicenter trials are expensive; this paper analyzes challenges to, and opportunities for, funding. Although National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding has dropped nearly 20% over the past ten years in inflation-adjusted dollars, it has begun a gradual reorientation toward clinical research, which comprised almost 50% of its budget in 2013. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act focused more attention on clinical outcomes research, with the establishment of the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI), which will ultimately fund $750 million of comparative effectiveness research annually. Another new funding source within the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation (CMMI), which recently funded several major initiatives, including a $1 billion health-care innovations grant program in 2012. The purpose of this article is to promote increased participation in prospective orthopaedic multicenter trials, which can answer clinical questions that affect the care of millions of patients. Some have enrolled large numbers of patients and have demonstrated the cost-effectiveness of surgery, provided subgroup analyses to define the optimal timing of surgery, and identified which patients are most and least helped by surgery. These studies have the power to establish new standards of care and prove the value of orthopaedic surgery. Copyright © 2015 by The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery, Incorporated."

The latest study on the topic was published in 2002, estimating the unintended pregnancy rate for women covered by employer-sponsored insurance benefits to be approximately 29%. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this study was to update the cost of unintended pregnancy to employer-sponsored health insurance plans with current data. The secondary objective was to develop a regression model to identify the factors and associated magnitude that contribute to unintended pregnancies in the employee benefits population. METHODS: We developed stepwise multinomial logistic regression models using data from a national survey on maternal attitudes about pregnancy before and shortly after giving birth. The survey was conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention through mail and via telephone interviews between 2009 and 2011 of women who had had a live birth. The regression models were then applied to a large commercial health claims database from the Truven Health MarketScan to retrospectively assign the probability of pregnancy intention to each delivery. RESULTS: Based on the MarketScan database, we estimate that among employer-sponsored health insurance plans, 28.8% of pregnancies are unintended, which is consistent with national findings of 29% in a survey by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. These unintended pregnancies account for 27.4% of the annual delivery costs to employers in the United States, or approximately 1% of the typical employer’s health benefits spending for 1 year. Using these findings, we present a regression model that employers could apply to their claims data to identify the risk for unintended pregnancies in their health insurance population. CONCLUSION: The availability of coverage for contraception without employee cost-sharing, as was required by the Affordable Care Act in 2012, combined with the ability to identify women who are at high risk for an unintended pregnancy, can help employers address the costs of unintended pregnancies in their employee benefits population. This can also help to bring contraception efforts into the mainstream of other preventive and wellness programs, such as smoking cessation, obesity management, and diabetes control programs. © 2015, Engage Healthcare Communications, Inc.

Recent evidence is presented revealing marked disparities in health by income and education as well as by race or ethnic group in the United States. Plausible explanations for the patterns are discussed in light of current knowledge of how social factors may influence health. A conceptual framework is presented for considering - and for addressing - how health disparities by race and class are created, exacerbated, and perpetuated, across the lifetimes of individuals and across generations. The authors argue that while ensuring that individuals have access to appropriate medical care and information about health-promoting behaviors is important, effective solutions also will require taking into account the social and physical contexts that powerfully shape health behaviors and health itself. More spending, less health Most people recognize the importance of health in human terms. Good health is essential to well-being and being able to participate fully in society, and poor health entails suffering, disability, and/or loss of life. The economic implications of health have become increasingly apparent as well. In the United States, health care spending has continued to rise dramatically during a period of time when the overall economy has markedly contracted (Truffer et al., 2010). In the United States, more is spent per person on medical care than in any other nation; projections based on current trends estimate that by 2019 medical care costs in the United States will reach more than 19 percent of the Gross Domestic Product. Although the Affordable Care Act of 2010, if fully implemented, should help many Americans obtain and keep coverage, the costs of medical care and insurance will continue to be out of reach for many households. Employers also are impacted by these costs, which are a deterrent to creating jobs. Medical care spending at the local, state, and federal level limits government investments in other crucial areas including infrastructure and education. The rising costs of providing care to an aging population and the growing number of obese Americans will further strain public and private budgets. © Cambridge University Press 2014."

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) relied upon the services of over 50 vendors to build the site, which was reportedly largely unusable when it first became available to the public on October 1, 2013, and has been the subject of ongoing work since then. Given HealthCare. gov's problematic debut, questions have arisen about how CMS selected vendors to work on HealthCare. gov, and the terms of the vendors' contractual relationships with the government. For example, some have wondered how CMS could assign work to specific vendors without engaging in ""full and open competition through the use of competitive procedures""; whether there are any restrictions on agencies' dealings with vendors that have foreign parent corporations, as some HealthCare. gov vendors do; and whether political input plays a role in the source-selection process. There have also been questions about how to obtain copies of particular contracts; vendor obligations to report performance problems to the government; modifications to existing contracts; how parties to a government contract resolve disputes; and whether the government can get its money back. Most recently, questions have been raised about potential amendments to federal procurement law that could, some commentators suggest, prevent issues of the sort experienced with HealthCare. gov. HeathCare. gov's early difficulties are generally seen to have increased interest in the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA) (H.R. 1232), which would, among other things, increase the authority of the top agency chief information officers. FITARA passed the House, as part of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for FY2014, prior to HealthCare. gov's rollout, but was not included in the NDAA as enacted (P.L. 113-66). Other measures have been introduced specifically in response to the rollout of HealthCare. gov (e.g., H.R. 3373, S. 1843). Yet other potential reforms have been suggested, but are not reflected in proposed legislation. Topics of such proposed reforms include consideration of risk and use of modular contracting methods when acquiring information technology (IT); performance bonds and express warranties; and use of lead system integrators (i.e., contractors responsible for assembling a system from components developed and/or tested by other vendors). The questions in this report are those that happen to have been frequently asked of the Congressional Research Service by congressional staffers. The inclusion of a particular question, or the exclusion of another question, should not be taken to indicate that particular factors did-or did not-contribute to HealthCare. gov's problematic debut. In addition, answers to these questions must often be provided in general terms, in part, because specific language in the parties' contracts may be subject to multiple interpretations and has not been construed by any court. In addition, the parties' conduct in performing the contract-the details of which are generally still emerging-can affect their rights. For example, the government could potentially be found to have waived certain rights that the contract's plain language would appear to grant to it by engaging in conduct that warrants an inference that it has relinquished the right. The authors of this report rely upon third-party investigations of the facts and circumstances surrounding HealthCare. gov, and additional information may emerge regarding topics discussed herein. This report provides answers to 20 frequently asked questions regarding contractors and HealthCare. gov, the federal online health insurance portal called for by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) (P.L. 111148, as amended). Over 50 contractors, including CGI Federal and Quality Software Services, Inc. (QSSI), helped in building the site, which was reportedly largely unusable when it first became available to the public on October 1, 2013, and has been the subject of ongoing work since then. Exactly what went wrong in terms of HealthCare. gov's rollout has been explored in several congressional hearings, and is under investigation by the Department of Health and Human Services inspector general. Litigation between the contract parties over costs or damages is also possible. The questions and answers in the report are organized into three broad categories addressing (1) the processes whereby the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) selected vendors; (2) the terms of the vendors' contractual relationships with the government; and (3) potential amendments to federal procurement law that, some commentators suggest, could help prevent issues of the sort experienced with HealthCare. gov.

To address this complexity, the Elder Justice Act was enacted as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA, P.L. 111-148, as amended). The act attempts to provide a coordinated federal response by emphasizing various public health and social service approaches to the prevention, detection, and treatment of elder abuse. The Elder Justice Act also represents Congress's first attempt at comprehensive legislation to address abuse, neglect, and exploitation of the elderly at the federal level. To date, most activities and programs authorized under the Elder Justice Act have not received federal funding through the annual appropriations process. Moreover, the authorizations of appropriations for most provisions under the act expire on September 30, 2014. As a result of this limited federal funding, the federal government has not substantially developed and expanded its role in addressing the prevention, detection, and treatment of elder abuse. Despite the lack of discretionary appropriations, some elder justice activities have received funding from mandatory funding appropriated through the ACA Prevention and Public Health Fund (PPHF). For FY2012, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) transferred $6.0 million to the Administration for Community Living (ACL) from the PPHF for new grants to states and tribes to test elder abuse prevention strategies. Funded projects included using forensic accountants to prevent elder financial exploitation, increasing medication adherence to prevent elder self-neglect, and developing screening tools to identify elder abuse. For FY2013, $2.0 million was transferred to ACL from the PPHF for elder justice activities, which funded development of the National Adult Protective Services Data Reporting System Project. No PPHF funds were transferred to ACL for elder justice activities for FY2014. For FY2015, the President's budget request includes $25.0 million in discretionary funding for the Elder Justice Initiative that would be used to fund Adult Protective Services, research, and evaluation activities. The 2015 budget request does not specify an intended transfer of funding from the PPHF for elder justice activities. On June 10, 2014, the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education (DOLHHS-ED) approved its FY2015 bill by voice vote. The subcommittee recommends $10.0 million for the Elder Justice Initiative. The House has yet to see legislative action in the subcommittee or full committee for its FY2015 DOL-HHS-ED appropriations bill. This report provides a brief legislative history of the Elder Justice Act, summarizes elder justice provisions enacted as part of ACA, and administrative efforts related to implementation and funding.

Exchanges are marketplaces where individuals and small businesses can ""shop"" for health insurance coverage. The ACA instructed each state to establish its own state-based exchange (SBE). If a state elected not to create an exchange or if the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) determined a state was not prepared to operate an exchange, the law directed HHS to establish a federally facilitated exchange (FFE) in the state. Fourteen states and DC established SBEs in 2014, while the remaining 36 states have FFEs. In some states that have FFEs, the states carry out certain functions of the exchange; in other states, the exchange is wholly operated and administered by HHS. The ACA provided an indefinite appropriation for HHS grants to states to support the planning and establishment of exchanges. For each fiscal year, the HHS Secretary is to determine the total amount that will be made available to each state for exchange grants. No grant may be awarded after January 1, 2015. There are three different types of exchange grants. First, planning grants were awarded to 49 states and DC. These grants of about $1 million each were intended to provide resources to states to help them plan their health insurance exchanges. Second, there have been multiple rounds of exchange establishment grants. There are two levels of exchange establishment grants: level one establishment grants are awarded to states that have made some progress using their planning funds, and level two establishment grants are designed to provide funding to states that are farther along in the establishment of an exchange. Finally, HHS awarded seven early innovator grants to states (including one award to a consortium of New England states) to support the design and implementation of the information technology systems needed to operate the exchanges. To date, HHS has awarded a total of more than $4.8 billion to states and DC in planning, establishment, and early innovator grants. Under the ACA, each exchange is expected to be self-sustaining beginning January 1, 2015. The law authorizes exchanges to generate funding to sustain their operations, including by assessing fees on participating health insurance issuers. To raise funds for each of the FFEs, beginning in 2014, HHS is assessing a monthly fee on each health insurance issuer that offers plans through an FFE. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is incurring significant administrative costs to support FFE operations. According to CMS, a total of $456 million was used to support exchange operations over the period FY2010-FY2012. CMS spent $1,545 million on exchange operations in FY2013 and an estimated $1,390 million in FY2014. The agency has relied on a mix of annual discretionary appropriations and funding from other sources for these expenditures. Those sources include expired discretionary funds from the Nonrecurring Expenses Fund, mandatory funding from the Health Insurance Reform Implementation Fund and the Prevention and Public Health Fund, and FFE user fees. CMS has budgeted $1.8 billion for exchange operations in FY2015. Most of that funding is projected to come from FFE user fees. © 2015 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved."

Medicaid is a federal and state partnership that is jointly financed by both the federal government and the states. The federal government's share for most Medicaid expenditures is called the federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP) rate. Generally determined annually, the FMAP formula is designed so that the federal government pays a larger portion of Medicaid costs in states with lower per capita incomes relative to the national average (and vice versa for states with higher per capita incomes). Federal Medicaid funding to states is open-ended. The federal government provides states a good deal of flexibility in determining the composition of the state share (also referred to as the non-federal share) of Medicaid expenditures. As a result, there is significant variation from state to state in the funding sources used to finance the state share of Medicaid expenditures. In state FY2012, states reported that on average state general funds (i.e., revenues from personal income, sales, and corporate income taxes) made up 77% of the state share of Medicaid expenditures and the remaining 23% was financed by ""other state funds"" (i.e., provider taxes, local government funds, and tobacco settlement funds). In FY2012, Medicaid expenditures totaled $431 billion, with the federal government paying $249 billion, about 58% of the total. While Medicaid expenditures (like all health expenditures) generally grow at a rate faster than the economy, as measured by the gross domestic product (GDP), spending per enrollee under Medicaid tends to be lower than the per person spending for other forms of health insurance. One of the major factors impacting Medicaid spending is the economy. Also, state-specific factors, such as programmatic decisions and demographics, affect Medicaid expenditures and cause Medicaid spending to vary widely from state to state. Starting in FY2014, Medicaid expenditures are expected to increase significantly as a result of the reforms enacted in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA, P.L. 111-148 as amended). The most noteworthy ACA change to Medicaid started January 1, 2014, when some states expanded Medicaid eligibility to adults under age 65 with income up to 133% of the federal poverty level (FPL) (effectively 138% FPL with the 5% FPL income disregard). Following the June 28, 2012, Supreme Court decision in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, it is uncertain how many states will expand their Medicaid program to cover this new group. According to the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation, the expansion is expected to increase federal Medicaid expenditures by $612 billion from FY2014 to FY2022, which is $319 billion less than the estimate conducted prior to the Supreme Court decision. This report provides an overview of Medicaid's financing structure, including both federal and state financing issues. The Medicaid expenditures section of the report discusses economic factors affecting Medicaid, state variability in spending, and projected program spending. Other issues that are examined include federal deficit reduction proposals affecting Medicaid and state fiscal conditions affecting Medicaid financing and services. © 2015 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

New trends in ambulatory settings are discussed and a review of the most current and comprehensive guidelines for the care of ambulatory patients with comorbid conditions such as postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), obstructive sleep apnea and diabetes mellitus are reviewed. Future direction and challenges to the field are highlighted. Recent findings Ambulatory anesthesia continues to be in high demand for many reasons; patients and surgeons want their surgical procedures to be swift, involve minimal postoperative pain, have a transient recovery time, and avoid an admission to the hospital. Factors that have made this possible for patients are improved surgical equipment, volatile anesthetic improvement, ultrasound-guided regional techniques, non-narcotic adjuncts for pain control, and the minimization of PONV. The decrease in time spent in a hospital also decreases the risk of wound infection, minimizes missed days from work, and is a socioeconomically favorable model, when possible. Recently proposed strategies which will allow surgeons and anesthesiologists to continue to meet the growing demand for a majority of surgical cases being same-day include pharmacotherapies with less undesirable side-effects, integration of ultrasound-guided regional techniques, and preoperative evaluations in appropriate candidates via a telephone call the night prior to surgery. Multidisciplinary communication amongst caregivers continues to make ambulatory settings efficient, safe, and socioeconomically favorable. It is also important to note the future impact that healthcare reform will have specifically on ambulatory anesthesia. The enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 will allow 32 million more people to gain access to preventive services that will require anesthesia such as screening colonoscopies. With this projected increase in the demand for anesthesia services nationwide comes the analysis of its financial feasibility. Some early data looking at endoscopist-administered sedation conclude that it offers higher patient satisfaction, there were less adverse effects than anesthesiologist-administered sedation, and is economically advantageous. This and future retrospective studies will help to guide healthcare policymakers and physicians to come to a conclusion about providing ambulatory services for these millions of patients. Summary Ambulatory anesthesia's popularity continues to rise and anesthetic techniques will continue to morph and adapt to the needs of patients seeking ambulatory surgery. Alterations in already existing medications are promising as these modifications allow for quicker recovery from anesthesia or minimization of the already known undesirable side-effects. PONV, pain, obstructive sleep apnea, and chronic comorbidities (hypertension, cardiac disease, and diabetes mellitus) are perioperative concerns in ambulatory settings as more patients are safely being treated in ambulatory settings. Regional anesthesia stands out as a modality that has multiple advantages to general anesthesia, providing a minimal recovery period and a decrease in postanesthesia care unit stay. The implementation of the Affordable Healthcare Act specifically affects ambulatory settings as the demand and need for patients to have screening procedures with anesthesia. The question remains what the best strategy is to meet the needs of our future patients while preserving economically feasibility within an already strained healthcare system. © 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Wade that the U.S. Constitution protects a woman's decision to terminate her pregnancy. In Doe v. Bolton, a companion decision, the Court found that a state may not unduly burden the exercise of that fundamental right with regulations that prohibit or substantially limit access to the means of effectuating the decision to have an abortion. Rather than settle the issue, the Court's rulings since Roe and Doe have continued to generate debate and have precipitated a variety of governmental actions at the national, state, and local levels designed either to nullify the rulings or limit their effect. These governmental regulations have, in turn, spawned further litigation in which resulting judicial refinements in the law have been no more successful in dampening the controversy. In recent years, the rights enumerated in Roe have been redefined by decisions such as Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, which gave greater leeway to the states to restrict abortion, and Rust v. Sullivan, which narrowed the scope of permissible abortion-related activities that are linked to federal funding. The Court's decision in Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey, which established the ""undue burden"" standard for determining whether abortion restrictions are permissible, gave Congress additional impetus to move on statutory responses to the abortion issue, such as the Freedom of Choice Act. Legislation to prohibit a specific abortion procedure, the so-called ""partial-birth"" abortion procedure, was passed in the 108th Congress. The Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act appears to be one of the only examples of Congress restricting the performance of a medical procedure. Legislation that would prohibit the knowing transport of a minor across state lines for the purpose of obtaining an abortion has been introduced in numerous Congresses. Since Roe, Congress has attached abortion funding restrictions to various appropriations measures. The greatest focus has arguably been on restricting Medicaid abortions under the annual appropriations for the Department of Health and Human Services. This restriction is commonly referred to as the ""Hyde Amendment"" because of its original sponsor. Similar restrictions affect the appropriations for other federal entities, including the Department of Justice, where federal funds may not be used to perform abortions in the federal prison system, except in cases of rape or if the life of the mother would be endangered. Hyde-type amendments also have an impact in the District of Columbia, where federal funds may not be used to perform abortions except in cases of rape, incest, or where the life of the mother would be endangered, and affect international organizations like the United Nations Population Fund, which receives funds through the annual Foreign Operations appropriations measure. The debate over abortion continued in the context of health reform. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), enacted on March 23, 2010, includes provisions that address the coverage of abortion services by qualified health plans that are available through health benefit exchanges. The ACA's abortion provisions have been controversial, particularly with regard to the use of premium tax credits or cost-sharing subsidies to obtain health coverage that includes coverage for elective or non-therapeutic abortion services. Under the ACA, individuals who receive a premium tax credit or cost-sharing subsidy are permitted to select a qualified health plan that includes coverage for elective abortions, subject to funding segregation requirements that are imposed on both the plan issuer and the enrollees in such a plan. © 2015 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Specifically, most individuals will be required to maintain minimum essential coverage, which is a term defined in ACA and its implementing regulations and includes most private and public coverage (e.g., employer-sponsored coverage, individual coverage, Medicare, and Medicaid, among others). Some individuals will be exempt from the mandate and the penalty, while others may receive financial assistance to help them pay for the cost of health insurance coverage and the costs associated with using health care services. Individuals who do not maintain minimum essential coverage and are not exempt from the mandate will have to pay a penalty for each month of noncompliance with the mandate. The penalty is the greater of a flat dollar amount or a percentage of applicable income. In 2014, the annual penalty is the greater of 95 or 1% of applicable income; the penalty increases in 2015 and 2016 and is adjusted for inflation thereafter. The penalty will be collected through federal income tax returns. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) can attempt to collect any owed penalties by reducing the amount of an individual's tax refund; however, individuals who fail to pay the penalty will not be subject to any criminal prosecution or penalty for such failure. The Secretary of the Treasury cannot file notice of lien or file a levy on any property for a taxpayer who does not pay the penalty. Certain individuals will be exempt from the individual mandate and the penalty. For example, individuals with qualifying religious exemptions and those whose household income is below the filing threshold for federal income taxes will not be subject to the penalty. ACA allows the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to grant hardship exemptions from the penalty to anyone determined to have suffered a hardship with respect to the capability to obtain coverage. The Secretary of HHS has identified a number of different circumstances that would allow individuals to receive a hardship exemption, including an individual not being eligible for Medicaid based on a state's decision not to carry out the ACA expansion and financial or domestic circumstances that prevent an individual from obtaining coverage (e.g., eviction or recent experience of domestic violence). ACA includes several reporting requirements designed, in part, to assist individuals in providing evidence of having met the mandate. Every person (including employers, insurers, and government programs) that provides minimum essential coverage to any individual must provide a return to the IRS that includes information about the individual's health insurance coverage. This report describes the individual mandate as established under the Affordable Care Act (ACA, P.L. 111-148, as amended).1 The report also discusses the ACA reporting requirements designed, in part, to assist individuals in providing evidence of having met the mandate. © 2015 Nova Science Publishers, Inc."

Medicaid is jointly funded by the federal government and the states. The federal government's share of a state's expenditures is called the federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP) rate. The remainder is referred to as the nonfederal share, or state share. Generally determined annually, the FMAP formula is designed so that the federal government pays a larger portion of Medicaid costs in states with lower per capita incomes relative to the national average (and vice versa for states with higher per capita incomes). FMAP rates have a statutory minimum of 50% and a statutory maximum of 83%. For FY2014, regular FMAP rates range from 50.00% to 73.05%. The FMAP rate is used to reimburse states for the federal share of most Medicaid expenditures, but exceptions to the regular FMAP rate have been made for certain states, situations, populations, providers, and services. Some recent issues related to FMAP include FMAP changes in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA, P.L. 111-148 as amended), federal deficit reduction proposals that would amend the FMAP rate, and the disaster-related FMAP adjustment. The ACA contains a number of provisions affecting FMAP rates. Most notably, the ACA provides initial FMAP rates of up to 100% for certain ""newly eligible"" individuals. Also, under the ACA, ""expansion states"" receive an enhanced FMAP rate for certain individuals. In addition, ACA provides increased FMAP rates for certain disaster-affected states, primary care payment rate increases, specified preventive services and immunizations, smoking cessation services for pregnant women, specified home and community-based services, health home services for certain people with chronic conditions, home and community-based attendant services and supports, and state balancing incentive payments. Since federal Medicaid expenditures are a large and growing portion of the federal budget, controlling federal Medicaid spending has been included in some federal deficit reduction proposals. Some of the federal deficit reduction proposals include provisions that would amend the current FMAP structure through either a blended FMAP or a reduction to the statutory FMAP floor. The ACA included a provision providing a disaster-recovery FMAP adjustment for states that have experienced a major, statewide disaster. Louisiana is the only state that has been eligible for the disaster-recovery adjusted FMAP since the fourth quarter of FY2011 (when the adjustment was first available). Both the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 (P.L. 112-96) and the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21, P.L. 112-141) amended the formula for the disaster-recovery adjusted FMAP. This report describes the FMAP calculation used to reimburse states for most Medicaid expenditures, and it lists the statutory exceptions to the regular FMAP rate. In addition, this report discusses other FMAP-related issues, including FMAP changes in ACA, federal deficit reduction proposals affecting the FMAP rate, and the disaster-recovery FMAP adjustment. © 2015 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The ACA, among other things, requires states to expand Medicaid eligibility or lose Medicaid funding. Following the enactment of the ACA, state attorneys general and others brought several lawsuits challenging various provisions of the act on constitutional grounds. In National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) v. Sebelius, the Supreme Court, among other things, decided that the enforcement mechanism for the ACA Medicaid expansion, withdrawal of all Medicaid funds, was a violation of the Tenth Amendment. The Court went on to hold, however, that the remedy was to sever that enforcement mechanism, effectively making state participation in the Medicaid expansion voluntary. In the 1987 case of South Dakota v. Dole, the Supreme Court held that, in order for a federal grant condition imposed on a state to pass constitutional muster under the Spending Clause, the condition must be related to the particular national projects or programs to which the money was being directed. In addition, in order to comply with the limits of the Tenth Amendment, the level of funds withheld for failure to comply with that condition cannot be coercive. In a controlling opinion in NFIB, Justice Roberts suggested that this analysis may vary based on the type of grant condition that was at issue. It is unclear, however, whether NFIB significantly changed the Dole analysis, or whether the combination of factors that led the Court's decision to limit how ACA Medicaid expansion would be enforced is likely to be repeated. For instance, if a grant condition is directly related to the expenditure of federal funds in a state program or activity, then, according to Justice Robert's opinion in NFIB, the condition is usually constitutional under the Spending Clause. Or even if a grant condition is only generally related to the policy goals of the underlying grant, NFIB suggests that withdrawal of all program funds would still, in most foreseeable cases, be constitutional under the Spending Clause and the Tenth Amendment. If a grant condition is unrelated to the general policy goals of the underlying grant, however, then it is most likely unconstitutional under the Spending Clause. This latter standard, however, has been in place since the Dole case, and no court has ever struck down a federal law on this basis. Justice Roberts' concern in NFIB arguably dealt with a different question: whether a grant condition attached to a new and independent program (here, the Medicaid expansion) which threatens the funding of an existing program (here Medicaid) is constitutional. In such cases, if the withholding of federal funding represents a significant portion of a state's budget, and there are distinguishing factors among the programs, then that condition may be unconstitutionally coercive under the Tenth Amendment. Justice Roberts did not identify a standard to determine what level of withholding funds would be coercive, or specify what kind of distinguishing factors were necessary. He did conclude, however, that withdrawal of federal program funds which made up ten percent of an average state's budget represented a ""gun to the head"" and was a form of ""economic dragooning."" How courts are to consider grant withdrawals below ten percent, however, is not addressed by the Roberts' opinion, and Justice Roberts declined to speculate where such a line would be drawn. It should be noted, however, that few federal programs even approach the level of Medicaid funds provided to the states. Thus, if the ten percent threshold and the need for distinguishing factors mark the outer limits of Congress's power, then the case may have minimal effect on existing or future federal grant conditions. © 2015 Nova Science Publishers, Inc."
