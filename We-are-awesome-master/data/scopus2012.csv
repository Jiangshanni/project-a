Federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) are a mainstay of primary care for the uninsured and those with limited access to care. This paper focuses on the impact of health reform on FQHCs given the significant federal investment in them through grants, Medicaid, and Medicare reimbursement. Where noteworthy, the effect on non-FQHC community clinics is also discussed. The implications of Medicaid coverage expansions (or lack thereof in states that choose not to expand), Medicaid disproportionate share hospital program cuts, discretionary budgets and sequestration, Medicare payment changes, contracting with qualified health plans in state health insurance exchanges, and delivery system reforms are explored."

Direct care workers are critical to the transitional care process and outcomes because they provide the majority of hands-on care to older adults across a range of settings where transitions occur. Their close relationship with residents, clients, and family members allows them to serve as a bridge between the health care system and the consumer. However, it is diffi cult to recruit and retain direct care workers and to develop a quality, competent workforce. Insuffi cient initial and ongoing training, without a specifi c focus on transitions of care, leaves these workers inadequately prepared and supported to address the complex health and functional needs of older adults and to have an active part of any transition team. Direct care workers are often forgotten partners in care coordination teams, even though they can be integral to successful transitions. This chapter concludes with a call to recognize direct care workers as a critical part of the transitional care team, the need for better training and organizational support to attain this goal, and the implications for public policy and practice. The passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), often referred to as the Affordable Care Act, with signifi cant attention on care coordination and successful transitions from one setting to another, provides an opportunity for direct care workers to be formally integrated into the process. © 2011 Springer Publishing Company."

It describes key policy initiatives adopted under recent health reform legislation, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, that promise to improve care for patients transitioning across care settings such as the Medicare Community-Based Care Transitions Program; incentives to reduce Medicare hospital readmissions; the Medicare Independence at Home Demonstration; medical home models in Medicare and Medicaid; community health teams to support medical homes, regardless of payor type; and workforce improvements that will support transitions of care. This chapter discusses implications of these initiatives, related research, promising transitional care models, and results of some recent efforts to improve care coordination, such as the Medicare Coordinated Care Demonstration. This chapter summarizes key policy provisions, mostly in the form of demonstration projects, designed to improve transitionalcare and care coordination, particularly for people with chronic conditions and their caregivers who receive fee-for-service health care under Medicare, Medicaid, and private health insurance. This chapter also describes selected policy initiatives intended to address the health care workforce needs of older adults who experience transitions and their informal caregivers.

A core purpose of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) is to provide health insurance for America's approximately fifty million uninsured. Implementation of universal health insurance, however, does not mean sufficient healthcare access for all, since the supply of physicians does not and will not meet demand. For reasons reviewed in this Article, the current physician shortage mainly impacts primary care providers. This shortage is particularly troubling because increased provision of primary care relative to specialty care has been associated with improvement in health outcomes, disease prevention, cost effectiveness, and coordination of care. This Article highlights provisions in the PPACA that impact primary care physicians. Finally, this Article proposes the creation of a universal primary care loan repayment program and a national residency exchange designed to alleviate the U.S. primary care crisis by facilitating optimal distribution of resident physicians in each medical specialty based on community need. © 2012 American Society of Law, Medicine & Ethics Boston University School of Law."

Data Sources Secondary data on MA plan offerings, contract offerings, and enrollment by state and county, in 2010-2011. Study Design We estimated regression models of the change in the number of plans, the number of contracts, and enrollment as a function of quartiles of FFS spending and pre-ACA MA payment generosity. Counties in the lowest quartile of spending are treated most generously by the ACA. Principal Findings Relative to counties in the highest quartile of spending, the number of plans in counties in the first, second, and third quartiles rose by 12 percent, 7.6 percent, and 5.4 percent, respectively. Counties with more generous MA payment rates before the ACA lost significantly more plans. We did not find a similar impact on the change in contracts or enrollment. Conclusions The ACA-induced MA payment changes reduced the number of plan choices available for Medicare beneficiaries, but they have yet affected enrollment patterns. © Health Research and Educational Trust."

As of December 7, 2010, at least 18 final rules had been issued implementing certain provisions in PPACA. An Appendix to this report lists these 18 final rules, including a summary of their requirements and their effective dates. PPACA specifically required that some of the rules be published. Other rules cited particular sections of PPACA as the statutory authority, but those sections did not specifically require the agencies to accomplish the underlying policy objectives through the rulemaking process. Most of the final rules were issued without a prior notice of proposed rulemaking, with the agencies often invoking the ""good cause"" exception in the Administrative Procedure Act (APA, 5 U.S.C. §551 et seq.) for not allowing the public to comment before the final rules were issued. In several of the rules, the issuing agencies also stated that Congress had specifically authorized the issuance of final rules without first issuing a proposed rule. Most of the final rules permitted post-promulgation public comments, with the comment periods ending on or after the dates that the rules took effect. Most of the rules were considered ""economically significant"" (i.e., with an annual impact on the economy of at least $100 million), so the agencies provided estimates of their costs, benefits, and transfers. © 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA; P.L. 111-148) is a particularly noteworthy example of congressional delegation of rulemaking authority to federal agencies. A previous CRS report identified more than 40 provisions in PPACA that require or permit the issuance of rules to implement the legislation. One way for Congress to identify upcoming PPACA rules is by reviewing the Unified Agenda of Federal Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions, which is published twice each year (spring and fall) by the Regulatory Information Service Center (RISC), a component of the U.S. General Services Administration, for the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA). The Unified Agenda lists upcoming activities, by agency, in five separate categories or stages of the rulemaking process: the prerule stage, the proposed rule stage, the final rule stage, long-term actions, and completed actions. All entries in the Unified Agenda have uniform data elements, including the department and agency issuing the rule, the title of the rule, its Regulation Identifier Number (RIN), an abstract describing the nature of action being taken, and a timetable showing the dates of past actions and a projected date for the next regulatory action. Each entry also contains an element indicating the priority of the regulation (e.g., whether it is considered ""economically significant"" under Executive Order 12866, or whether it is considered a ""major"" rule under the Congressional Review Act). This report examines the most recent edition of the Unified Agenda, published on July 7, 2011 (the second edition that RISC compiled and issued after the enactment of PPACA). The report identifies upcoming proposed and final rules listed in the July 7, 2011, Unified Agenda that are expected to be issued pursuant to PPACA. The Appendix lists these upcoming proposed and final rules in a table.

In general, PPACA did not make any significant changes to the Department of Defense (DOD) TRICARE program or to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system. However, many have sought clarification as to whether certain provisions in PPACA, such as a mandate for most individuals to have health insurance, or extending dependant coverage up to age 26, would apply to TRICARE and VA health care beneficiaries. To address some of these concerns, Congress has introduced and/or enacted legislation. The TRICARE Affirmation Act (H.R. 4887; P.L. 111-159), signed into law on April 26, 2010, affirms that TRICARE satisfies the minimum acceptable coverage requirement in PPACA. Similarly, P.L. 111-173, signed into law on May 27, 2010, clarifies that the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs (CHAMPVA), Spina Bifida Health Care Program, and the Children of Women Vietnam Veterans Health Care Program meet the ""minimum essential coverage"" requirement under PPACA. TRICARE coverage of children was extended to age 26 by the Ike Skelton National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011 (P.L. 111-383). PPACA requires that if a health insurance plan provides for dependent coverage of children, the plan must continue to make such coverage available for an adult child until age 26. This requirement relating to coverage of adult children will take effect for the plan years beginning on or after September 23, 2010. Under PPACA, both married and unmarried children will qualify for this coverage. The authorizing statute for CHAMPVA currently does not conform to this PPACA requirement. Furthermore, although the TRICARE authorizing statute has been amended to provide for coverage of children until age 26, the coverage provided by the new legislation differs from that required by PPACA in some important ways. To address the CHAMPVA situation, the CHAMPVA Children's Protection Act of 2011 (H.R. 115) has been introduced in the 112th Congress, although it has seen no action so far.

(PPACA refers to P.L. 111-148 as amended by P.L. 111-152.) On January 19, 2011, the House passed H.R. 2, which would repeal PPACA. It is possible that the 112th Congress will examine other legislation to amend parts of PPACA. One issue that may arise during any debate to amend provisions in PPACA is the eligibility of aliens (noncitizens) for some of the key provisions of the act. Aliens who are ""lawfully present in the United States"" are subject to the heath insurance mandate and are eligible, if otherwise qualified, to participate in the high-risk pools and the exchanges, and they are eligible for premium credits and cost-sharing subsidies. PPACA expressly exempts unauthorized (illegal) aliens from the mandate to have health coverage and bars them from a health insurance exchange. Unauthorized aliens are not eligible for the federal premium credits or cost-sharing subsidies. Unauthorized aliens are also barred from participating in the temporary high-risk pools. To enforce the alien eligibility requirements under PPACA, the act requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a program to determine whether an individual who is to be covered in the individual market by a qualified health plan offered through an exchange, or who is claiming a premium tax credit or reduced cost-sharing, is a citizen or national of the United States or an alien lawfully present in the United States. Some have raised concerns that PPACA created an inequality between U.S. citizens and some noncitizens with incomes at or below 133% of the federal poverty level (FPL) with respect to eligibility to participate in an exchange and receive premium credits or cost-sharing subsidies. In general, all U.S. citizens and Medicaid-eligible noncitizens with incomes at or below 133% of FPL will be eligible for Medicaid, while similarly situated Medicaid-ineligible lawfully present noncitizens will be eligible to participate in an exchange and possibly to receive the credits or subsidies. © 2012 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Given that most Americans had private health insurance coverage on the date of enactment of PPACA, most Americans' health coverage was affected by the grandfathering provisions. A grandfathered health plan is an existing group health plan or health insurance coverage (including coverage from the individual health insurance market) in which a person was enrolled on the date of enactment. Therefore, as long as a person was enrolled in a health insurance plan on March 23, 2010, that plan has been grandfathered. Current enrollees in grandfathered health plans are allowed to re-enroll in that plan, even if renewal occurs after the date of enactment. Family members are allowed to enroll in the grandfathered plan, if such enrollment is permitted under the terms of the plan in effect on the date of enactment. For grandfathered group plans, new employees (and their families) may enroll in such plans. Grandfathered health plans are exempt from the majority of new insurance reforms under PPACA. However, grandfathered plans are subject to a handful of requirements: (1) uniform explanation of coverage documents; (2) medical loss ratio reporting and premium rebates; (3) prohibition on lifetime limits; (4) restriction on rescissions; (5) dependent coverage for children under 26 years of age; (6) prohibition on excessive waiting periods; (7) restricted annual limits; and (8) coverage for preexisting health conditions. Enrollment in a grandfathered plan meets the individual mandate requirements that are effective in 2014. On June 17, 2010, the Departments of Health and Human Services, Labor, and Treasury (""Departments"") issued interim final rules with request for comments regarding grandfathered plans. The regulation identified certain changes to benefits, cost-sharing, employer contributions, and access to coverage that would cause the loss of grandfathered status. It also clarified the loss of grandfathered status in either of the following instances: for a plan that did not have continuous enrollment (does not need to be the same enrollee), and termination of an existing collective bargaining agreement under which grandfathered health coverage was provided. In addition, the regulation included transitional rules that provide some flexibility in allowing changes to be made to the terms of a plan or coverage after enactment that do not cause loss of grandfathered status, and analysis of the potential impact of grandfathering rules on group and individual health plans. Comments on the interim final rules were due by August 16, 2010. Among the issues that generated comments from different stakeholder groups (health plans, employers, consumers, and state regulators) are prescription drug formularies, provider networks, cost-sharing, plan design and funding, and plan disclose requirements. On November 17, 2010, the Departments published an amendment to the interim final rules on grandfathered health plans. The amendment permits group health plans to change insurance carriers and still maintain grandfathered status. © 2012 Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved."

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA, P.L. 111-148, March 23, 2010) is a particularly noteworthy example of congressional delegation of rulemaking authority to federal agencies. This report identifies more than 40 provisions in PPACA (as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, P.L. 111-152, March 30, 2010) that require, permit, or contemplate rulemaking by federal agencies to implement the legislation. Where new regulations are required in PPACA, this report also describes provisions in the act that prescribe the substance of certain regulations, procedural requirements regarding the development of those rules, and provisions that establish regulatory deadlines. Where PPACA permits, but does not require, certain regulations, the amount of discretion provided to the agencies appears to vary, as well as the implications of that discretion. In some cases, the agencies appear able to decide whether to take any action, and if so, whether that action takes the form of a regulation or some other method of policy implementation (e.g., adjudication, policy statements, guidance, or memoranda). Other sections in PPACA do not specifically require or permit the development of regulations, instead referring to regulations ""issued by the Secretary"" or ""promulgated by the Secretary."" If these sections refer to existing rules, then new regulations may not be needed. The report indicates that PPACA gives federal agencies substantial responsibility and authority to ""fill in the details"" of the legislation through subsequent regulations. Although some regulations were required in 2010, it seems likely that other regulations will be issued for years, or even decades to come. Also, although Congress delegates rulemaking authority for a variety of reasons, the manner in which Congress does so can determine who makes those decisions, and in what manner. When Congress requires that a regulation be issued or made effective by a particular date, that it contain certain substantive elements, and that the rule be developed following certain procedures, then the delegation of legislative rulemaking authority is somewhat limited and Congress retains a measure of control over the subsequent policymaking process. On the other hand, Congress grants substantial discretion to the regulatory agencies when it gives the heads of those agencies broad authority to ""prescribe such regulations as may be necessary."" Even more discretion may be given to the agencies when Congress permits agencies to decide certain threshold issues. While the regulations are being developed, or after they are issued, Congress and individual Members have various oversight options, including oversight hearings, meeting with agency officials and filing comments, the Congressional Review Act, and restrictions on agency appropriations. © 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Some of these new entities are offices within existing cabinet departments and agencies, and are assigned certain administrative or representational duties related to the legislation. Other entities are new boards and commissions with particular planning and reporting responsibilities. Still others are advisory bodies that were created to study particular issues, offer recommendations, or both. Although PPACA describes some of these new organizations and advisory bodies in detail, in many cases it is currently impossible to know how much influence they will ultimately have over the implementation of the legislation. This report describes dozens of new governmental organizations or advisory bodies that are mentioned in PPACA, but does not include other types of entities that were created by the legislation (e.g., various demonstration projects, grants, trust funds, programs, systems, formulas, guidelines, risk pools, websites, ratings areas, model agreements, or protocols). A table in the Appendix is organized in terms of entities (1) that were created by PPACA itself (e.g., through statutory language stating that an organization is ""established"" or ""created""); (2) that PPACA requires the President to establish (e.g., ""the President shall establish""); (3) that PPACA requires the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to establish (e.g., ""the Secretary shall establish""); (4) that PPACA requires some other organization to establish; and (5) that PPACA authorizes to be established. For each entity listed, the table identifies (to the extent provided in the legislation) the relevant section of PPACA, the name of the entity, the date that the entity is required to be created and its location, the composition of the entity and its leadership, and the purpose and duties of the entity. The precise number of new entities that will ultimately be created pursuant to PPACA is currently unknowable, for the number of entities created by some sections is contingent upon other factors, and some new entities may satisfy more than one requirement in the legislation. Although PPACA states that certain entities were ""established"" by the legislation, in practical terms, these entities will not be able to function until members are appointed and appropriations are provided or made available. The legislation sometimes indicates when and where certain entities are to be established, how members are to be appointed, the amount and timing of appropriations, whether certain general management laws are applicable, and when the entities will cease to exist. In other cases, however, PPACA is silent with regard to these and other issues. The degree of specificity in these provisions may have implications for congressional control and, conversely, the amount of discretion that agencies will have in the implementation of the legislation. PPACA significantly increased the appointment responsibilities of the Comptroller General of the United States, and it is unclear how the Government Accountability Office (GAO) will be able to independently audit entities whose members are appointed by the head of GAO. © 2012 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The purpose of this column is to relate the importance of an enhanced relationship between health policy education, clinical nursing practice, and future involvement in healthcare policy and patient advocacy."

Although there is agreement that there should be greater coordination of initiatives and resources, there is little guidance in the literature to address the method to achieve the necessary transformation. Traditional approaches to strategic planning often engage a few leaders and produce a set of immeasurable initiatives. A nontraditional approach, consisting of a Whole-Scale (Dannemiller Tyson Associates, Ann Arbor, MI) engagement, appreciative inquiry, and a balanced scorecard can, more rapidly transform an academic health center. Using this nontraditional approach to strategic planning, increased organizational awareness was achieved in a single academic health center. Strategic planning can be an effective tool to achieve alignment, enhance accountability, and a first step in meeting the demands of the new landscape of healthcare."

Analysis of state trends in private employer-based health insurance from 2003 to 2011 reveals that premiums for family coverage increased 62 percent across states--rising far faster than income for middle- and low-income families. At the same time, deductibles more than doubled in large and small firms. Workers are thus paying more but getting less-protective benefits. If trends continue at their historical rate, the average premium for family coverage will reach nearly $25,000 by 2020. The Affordable Care Act's reforms should begin to moderate costs while improving coverage. But with private insurance costs projected to increase faster than incomes over the next decade, further efforts are needed. If annual premium growth slowed by one percentage point, by 2020 employers and families would save $2,029 annually for family coverage."

This issue brief examines whether insurers have reduced administrative costs and profit margins in response to the new MLR rule. In 2011, the first year under the rule, insurers reduced administrative costs nation-ally, with the greatest decrease--over $785 million--occurring in the large-group market. Small-group and individual markets decreased their administrative costs by about $200 million each. In the individual market, insurers passed these savings on to consumers by reducing their profits even more than administrative costs. But in the large- and small-group markets, lower administrative costs were offset by increased profits of a similar amount. Stronger measures may be needed if consumers are to benefit from reduced over-head costs in the group insurance markets."

Following on those changes, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) was passed in 2010, with a goal of increasing access, improving patient outcomes, and curbing escalating healthcare costs, while providing 32 million more Americans with health insurance coverage. The partisan political climate in Washington, DC, and the serious budget deficit facing Congress, forecast an uncertain future for the ACA. Despite these uncertainties, there is considerable agreement by public and private payers, many healthcare systems, and employers about the need to improve America's healthcare system. The ACA encourages a healthcare system transformation that includes integration of behavioral healthcare into primary care settings and it is not clear what role psychologists will have in that evolving system. Additionally, mental and behavioral health services will be included in the Medicaid expansion program and state-based health insurance exchange plans. Critical issues affecting independent practitioners in the evolving healthcare system include access to program participation in Medicaid and health insurance exchange products, payment reform, new reimbursement structures, evolving practice models, acquisition of the skills necessary to practice in team-based primary care environments, and demonstration of psychology's value to the greater healthcare system. As these issues are addressed in the legislative, legal, and regulatory arenas, it is imperative that psychology's voice is heard.

I focus on both how the extent of insurance coverage can increase incentives to adopt new treatments, and how the parameters of the insurance contract can impact the types of treatments adopted. Methodology/approach - I provide a review of the previous theoretical and empirical literature and highlight evidence on this relationship from previous expansions of Medicaid eligibility to low-income pregnant women. Findings - While health insurance has important effects on individuallevel choices of health care consumption, increases in the fraction of the population covered by insurance has also been found to have broader supply side effects as hospitals respond to changes in demand by changing the type of care offered. Furthermore, hospitals respond to the design of insurance contracts and adopt more or less cost-effective technologies depending on the incentive system. Research limitations/implications - Understanding how insurance changes supply side incentives is important as we consider future changes in the insurance landscape. Originality/value of paper - With these previous findings in mind, I conclude with a discussion of how the Affordable Care Act may alter hospital technology adoption incentives by both expanding coverage and changing payment schemes.

This paper provides an overview of state oral health priorities for action as reflected in 40 oral health plans that were developed independently by states. It examines four federal laws - the 2002 Safety Net Improvement Act, the 2009 CHIP Reauthorization Act, the 2009 economic stimulus law, and the 2010 health reform law - to identify opportunities for alignment with action steps proposed in state plans. This analysis identifies 23 categories of activity proposed by states in their action plans and determines that all but six of these activities are now supported by one or more of these four federal laws. State activities undertaken through grants provided under the 2002 Safety Net Improvement Act are analyzed as an example of how states can leverage federal legislation to advance their oral health plans.

It is unclear whether specific hospital characteristics are associated with a hospital's VBP score, and consequently incentive payments.The objective of the study was to assess the association of hospital characteristics with (i) the mean VBP score, and (ii) specific percentiles of the VBP score distribution. The secondary objective was to quantify the associations of hospital characteristics with the VBP score components: clinical process of care (CPC) score and patient satisfaction score. Observational analysis that used data from three sources: Medicare Hospital Compare Database, American Hospital Association 2010 Annual Survey and Medicare Impact File. The final study sample included 2,491 U.S. acute care hospitals eligible for the VBP program. The association of hospital characteristics with the mean VBP score and specific VBP score percentiles were assessed by ordinary least square (OLS) regression and quantile regression (QR), respectively. VBP score had substantial variations, with mean score of 30 and 60 in the first and fourth quartiles of the VBP score distribution. For-profit status (vs. non-profit), smaller bed size (vs. 100-199 beds), East South Central region (vs. New England region) and the report of specific CPC measures (discharge instructions, timely provision of antibiotics and beta blockers, and serum glucose controls in cardiac surgery patients) were positively associated with mean VBP scores (p<0.01 in all). Total number of CPC measures reported, bed size of 400-499 (vs. 100-199 beds), a few geographic regions (Mid-Atlantic, West North Central, Mountain and Pacific) compared to the New England region were negatively associated with mean VBP score (p<0.01 in all). Disproportionate share index, proportion of Medicare and Medicaid days to total inpatient days had significant (p<0.01) but small effects. QR results indicate evidence of differential effects of some of the hospital characteristics across low-, medium- and high-quality providers. Although hospitals serving the poor and the elderly are more likely to score lower under the VBP program, the correlation appears small. Profit status, geographic regions, number and type of CPC measures reported explain the most variation among scores."

This raises hard questions determining which services will be offered and what they should achieve to satisfy public demands and needs. We consider impending dental health reforms in the US and UK within the context of contemporary experiences to identify issues and delivery goals for the two nations. Background: The paper provides a brief history and background of the development of social dental care models in the UK and US, highlighting some differences in state-funded delivery of dental care. Shifting Demand: From the 1950s, demand for dental treatment has increased and acquired a more complex composition growing from predominantly surgical and restorative treatment to encompass preventive care and cosmetic services. Prioritising care according to need: Despite improvements in general health and technology, inequalities in access and utilisation of dental care are still experienced, primarily by groups with low socio-economic status. Delivery: balancing resources, demand and need: In developing and delivering reform agendas, much can be learned from previous policy interventions. Pressures of cost, coverage, and capacity, besides demand versus need must be carefully considered and balanced to deliver quality service and value for users and taxpayers. Conclusions: Ethical and moral consideration should be given to making services needs-driven to address high treatment requirements rather than the high care demands of the worried well. This challenge brings the additional political pressure of convincing many of the voters (and subsequent complainers) that their demands may be less important than the needs of others. © BASCD 2012."

We conducted a qualitative study among leaders of Medicaid managed care plans, that currently have access to standardized quality data stratified by race and ethnicity, to learn how they use it to address disparities. Methods: We conducted semi-structured interviews with 21 health plan leaders across 9 Medicaid managed care plans in California. We used purposive sampling to maximize heterogeneity in geography and plan type (e.g., non-profit, commercial). We performed a thematic analysis based on iterative coding by two investigators. Results: We found 4 major themes. Improving overall quality was tightly linked to a focus on standardized metrics that are integral to meeting regulatory or financial incentives. However, reducing disparities was not driven by standardized data, but by a mix of factors. Data were frequently only examined by race and ethnicity when overall performance was low. Disparities were attributed to either individual choices or cultural and linguistic factors, with plans focusing interventions on recently immigrated groups. Conclusions: While plans' efforts to address overall quality were often informed by standardized data, actions to reduce disparities were not, at least partly because there were few regulatory or financial incentives driving meaningful use of data on disparities. Standardized data, as envisaged by the Affordable Care Act, could become more useful for addressing disparities if they are combined with policies and regulations that promote health care equity."

Study Design We test for changes in hospital costs and revenues and Medicare payments among 260 hospitals participating in the Medicare hospital pay-for-performance demonstration project and a group of 780 propensity-score-matched comparison hospitals. Effects were estimated using a difference-in-difference model with hospital fixed effects, testing for changes in costs among pay-for-performance hospitals above and beyond changes in comparison hospitals. Principal Findings We found no significant effect of pay-for-performance on hospital financials (revenues, costs, and margins) or Medicare payments (index hospitalization and 1 year after admission) for AMI patients. Conclusions Pay-for-performance in the CMS hospital demonstration project had minimal impact on hospital financials and Medicare payments to providers.

Nevertheless, the doctrine remains underexplored. In particular, no commentator has thoroughly examined choice-of-law rules pertaining to its application. This Article aims to fill that void. The Article contends that in recent decisions the Supreme Court has quietly established the severability of state statutes in federal court to be a matter of general federal common law, and that this doctrine is not only inconsistent with dozens of cases decided since Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins, but also displaces a large body of diverse state law without constitutional authorization or a supporting federal interest.

My first claim is that approaches that privilege traditional subjects of state regulation are unworkable and undesirable. These approaches are unworkable in light of the frequency with which the federal government and the states regulate the same subject matter in our world of largely overlapping federal and state legislative jurisdiction. The approaches are undesirable because the question of customary allocation is unrelated to the principal reason why Congress possesses the power to regulate interstate commerce: solving collective action problems involving multiple states. These problems are evident in the way that some federal judges invoked regulatory custom in litigation over the constitutionality of the minimum coverage provision in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The areas of ""health insurance"" and ""health care"" are not of exclusive state concern, and it is impossible to lose-or to win-a competition requiring skillful lawyers or judges to describe them as more state than federal, or more federal than state. Nor is it most important what the answer is. More promising are the approaches that view congressional authority as turning on either commercial activity or collective action problems facing the states. My second claim is that these two approaches have advantages and disadvantages, and that the choice between them exemplifies the more general tension between applying rules and applying their background justifications. I have previously defended a collective action approach to Article I, Section 8.

The Part A program is financed primarily through payroll taxes levied on current workers and their employers; these are credited to the HI trust fund. The Part B program is financed through a combination of monthly premiums paid by current enrollees and general revenues. Income from these sources is credited to the SMI trust fund. Beneficiaries can choose to receive all their Medicare services, except hospice, through managed care plans under the MA program; payment is made on their behalf in appropriate parts from the HI and SMI trust funds. A separate account in the SMI trust fund accounts for the Part D drug benefit; Part D is financed through general revenues, beneficiary premiums, and state contributions. The HI and SMI trust funds are overseen by a board of trustees that makes annual reports to Congress. The 2012 report of the Medicare Board of Trustees estimates that the HI trust fund will become insolvent in 2024, the same as it had predicted in the 2011 report. This recent projection still postpones depletion further in the future than the year of 2017, as projected in the 2009 report prior to the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA, P.L. 111-148), as amended, but earlier than the 2029 date estimated in the 2010 report immediately after the ACA's enactment. Because of the way it is financed, the SMI fund cannot face insolvency; however, the trustees project that SMI expenditures will continue to grow rapidly, and thus place increasing demands on Medicare beneficiaries and all taxpayers. The trustees estimate that total Medicare costs will increase from 3.7% of GDP in 2011 to 6.7% in 2086.Although the Medicare trustees report that the financial outlook for the Medicare program appears to have improved as a result of ACA, they caution that the projections in the report are more uncertain than normal, due to the potential for future expenditure reductions not to materialize. In addition, the report projections assume that reductions in physician payment rates scheduled under current law will occur, although these reductions have usually been overridden by Congress. As such, as it has done each year subsequent to the enactment of ACA, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Office of the Actuary issued a supplemental analysis that provides projections based on an ""illustrative alternative"" to current law. © 2013 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

2012,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84892982532&partnerID=40&md5=0a0526437412b698b9edf9f8a73b7983","Medicare is a federal insurance program that pays for covered health care services of qualified beneficiaries. It was established in 1965 under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act as a federal entitlement program to provide health insurance to individuals 65 and older, and has been expanded over the years to include permanently disabled individuals under 65. Medicare, which consists of four parts (A-D), covers hospitalizations, physician services, prescription drugs, skilled nursing facility care, home health visits, and hospice care, among other services.Generally, individuals are eligible for Medicare if they or their spouse worked for at least 40 quarters in Medicare-covered employment, are 65 years old, and are a citizen or permanent resident of the United States. Individuals may also qualify for coverage if they are a younger person with a permanent disability, have End-Stage Renal disease (permanent kidney failure requiring dialysis or transplant), or have amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease). In addition, individuals with one or more specified lung diseases or types of cancer who lived for six months during a specified period prior to diagnosis in an area subject to a public health emergency declaration by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as of June 17, 2009, are also deemed entitled to benefits under Part A and eligible to enroll in Part B. In FY2012, the program will cover approximately 50 million persons (41 million aged and 9 million disabled) at a total cost of about $576 billion, accounting for approximately 3.7% of GDP. Medicare is an entitlement program, which means that it is required to pay for covered services provided to eligible persons so long as specific criteria are met. Since 1965, the Medicare program has undergone considerable change. During the 111th Congress, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA; P.L. 111-148) and the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 (the Reconciliation Act, or HCERA; P.L. 111-152) were signed into law. They made numerous changes to the Medicare program that modify provider reimbursements, provide incentives to increase the quality and efficiency of care, and enhance certain Medicare benefits. However, in the absence of congressional action, the Medicare program will be unsustainable in the long run. The Hospital Insurance (Part A) trust fund has been estimated to become insolvent in 2024. And although the Supplementary Medical Insurance (Parts B and D) trust fund is financed in large part through federal general revenues and cannot become insolvent, Medicare spending growth will put increasing strains on Congress's competing priorities. The 112th Congress may continue to debate the recent changes to Medicare and may also consider additional legislative action ranging from technical corrections to broader structural changes. Additionally, Congress may consider legislative action to address the 2013-2021 automatic Medicare spending reductions under the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA; P.L. 112-25). © 2013 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

2012,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84891986364&partnerID=40&md5=67b344b959644a3b7862a27958f34dfb","The Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA; P.L. 112-25) established new budget enforcement mechanisms for reducing the federal deficit by at least $2.1 trillion over the 10-year period FY2012-FY2021. The BCA placed statutory limits, or caps, on discretionary spending for each of those 10 fiscal years, which will save an estimated $0.9 trillion during that period. In addition, it created a Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction (Joint Committee) with instructions to develop legislation to reduce the federal deficit by at least another $1.5 trillion through FY2021. On November 21, 2011, the Joint Committee announced that it was unable to agree on a legislative package of deficit cuts, which raises the likelihood of automatic annual spending reductions beginning in FY2013. Under the BCA, the reductions would be achieved by a combination of sequestration-an automatic across-the-board cancellation of budgetary resources (i.e., spending cuts) for nonexempt direct spending programs-and lowering the caps on discretionary spending. The potential impact of spending reductions triggered by the BCA on health reform spending under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) would appear to be somewhat limited. ACA sought to increase access to affordable health insurance by expanding the Medicaid program and by restructuring the private health insurance market. It set minimum standards for private insurance coverage, created a mandate for most U.S. residents to obtain coverage, and provided for the establishment by 2014 of state-based insurance exchanges for the purchase of health insurance. Certain individuals and families will be able to receive federal subsidies to reduce the cost of purchasing coverage through the exchanges. The new law included direct spending to subsidize the purchase of health insurance coverage through the exchanges, as well as increased outlays for the Medicaid expansion. Under the rules governing sequestration, Medicaid spending would be exempt from any reduction, and cuts to Medicare would be capped at 2%. ACA also included numerous mandatory appropriations that provide billions of dollars to support temporary programs to increase coverage and funding for targeted groups, provide funds to states to plan and establish exchanges, and support many other research and demonstration programs and activities. These appropriations would, in general, be subject to direct spending reductions under a sequestration order. However, for any given fiscal year in which sequestration was ordered, only new budget authority for that year (including advance appropriations that first become available for obligation in that year) would be reduced. Unobligated balances carried over from previous fiscal years would be exempt from sequestration. ACA is likely to affect discretionary spending subject to the annual appropriations process. The law reauthorized appropriations for numerous existing discretionary grant programs and activities authorized under the Public Health Service Act, permanently reauthorized funding for the Indian Health Service (IHS), and created a number of new grant programs and provided for each an authorization of appropriations. In addition, the Congressional Budget Office projected that both the Department of Health and Human Services and the Internal Revenue Service will incur substantial administrative costs to implement the policies and programs established by ACA. Those costs will have to be funded largely through the annual appropriations process. Most of the ACA-related discretionary spending would be subject to automatic spending reductions triggered by the BCA. © 2013 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All Rights Reserved."

Consequently, congressional interest has been expressed about the importance of the proper classification of workers. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) defines the gross tax gap as the difference between the aggregate tax liability imposed by law for a given tax year and the amount of tax that taxpayers pay voluntarily and timely for that year. A business owner must withhold income taxes, withhold and pay Social Security and Medicare taxes, and pay unemployment tax on wages paid to an employee. In contrast, a business owner does not have to withhold or pay any taxes on payments to independent contractors. Employers are more likely to withhold and submit taxes than independent contractors are to voluntarily pay their tax liabilities. In 1984, the IRS made its last comprehensive misclassification estimate, which found that 15% of employers misclassified 3.4 million workers as independent contractors, causing an estimated total tax loss of $1.6 billion in Social Security tax, unemployment tax, and income tax. Under common-law rules, a worker is an employee if the employer can control what the worker does and how the worker does it. The definition of ""employee"" has been affected by Section 530 ""Safe Harbor Rules,"" IRS Ruling 87-41, and current IRS common law rules. Congress enacted Section 530 of the Revenue Act of 1978 (P.L. 95-600), which established ""safe harbor rules"" generally allowing an employer to treat a worker as not being an employee for employment tax purposes, regardless of the individual's actual status under the common-law test. In January 1987, the IRS issued Revenue Ruling 87-41 specifying 20 factors that identified whether or not an employee-employer relationship existed under common law. Currently, the IRS states that three categories of common-law rules provide evidence of the degree of control and independence: behavior, financial, and type of relationship. On February 4, 2009, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) issued a report concerning IRS actions to address the misclassification of employees as independent contractors. In the 111th Congress, six bills were introduced concerning the misclassification of employees. In his FY2012 budget, President Barack Obama proposed to ""increase certainty with respect to worker classification"" by a modification of the Section 530 of the Revenue Act of 1978. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (P.L. 111-148) included a provision requiring information reporting on payments to corporations including incorporated independent contractors. Also the information reporting requirement was expanded to include goods as well as services. Legislation has been introduced in the 112th Congress to repeal this reporting provision. In conclusion, the misclassification of employees as independent contractors contributes to the tax gap and imposes numerous costs on the economy. A reduction in this misclassification would reduce federal, state, and local tax gaps and provide other important benefits. But, this decline in misclassification would impose significant costs. Accurate data on the current size of the tax gap caused by misclassification are unavailable. Furthermore, the magnitude of many effects of improved classification are unavailable or inherently subjective. With the current state of knowledge, whether or not the benefits of curtailing misclassification of workers outweigh the costs is a value judgment. © 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) estimated that these readmissions cost the Medicare program as much as $15 billion per year and that perhaps as much as two-thirds of these readmissions may be preventable. Many policymakers believe that different care transition programs coupled with payment reforms can constrain hospital readmissions among Medicare's fee-for-service (FFS) beneficiaries, could improve patient care, and may generate cost savings for the program. Hospital readmissions are associated with a number of factors and are not necessarily attributable to problems with the quality of patient care, but strong evidence indicates specific interventions to better manage care transitions at the time of hospital discharge could reduce readmissions for certain conditions. Medicare is building on past work by Quality Improvement Organizations (QIOs) to help providers identify the underlying causes of hospital readmissions in their communities and then develop different strategies to prevent those rehospitalizations. In their newest round of Medicare contracts, which began August 1, 2011, QIOs will work to reduce readmissions 20% by 2013 and provide technical assistance to participants in the Community Care Transitions Program (CCTP), a $500 million, five-year demonstration program established by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA as amended, P.L. 111-148) to help participating hospitals improve discharge procedures and manage patients' care transitions more effectively. CCTP may be continued or expanded if the Office of the Actuary (OACT) certifies that the expansion would reduce Medicare spending without reducing quality. By mid-March 2012, 30 sites had been selected. As well as establishing CCTP, ACA included several payment initiatives to encourage FFS providers, particularly hospitals, to work to minimize rehospitalizations and coordinate patient care across settings. Two initiatives in particular are discussed in this report, the Hospital Readmission Reduction Program (HRRP) and bundled payments. The HRRP will penalize an acute care hospital with higher than expected readmission rates by as much as 1% of its base payments starting in FY2013. Initially, the HRRP must use the three existing readmission measures that are endorsed by the National Quality Forum (NQF) and are included on Medicare's Hospital COMPARE website (where publically reported data can be used to assess hospital performance). Hospitals and industry advocates have expressed concerns about the existing measures and the effect of the readmission penalties on certain safety-net hospitals; issues that are likely to attract significant Congressional attention as the program's implementation date approaches. CMS is also exploring bundled payment methods where a single payment is made for a defined group of services rather than individual payments for each service. The national bundled payment pilot program established by the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Innovation (CMMI) is a three-year project starting in 2012 that will encompass four different bundled payment models. Changing these FFS financial incentives may be Medicare's most effective strategy for addressing hospital readmissions. This report examines the complex issue of hospital readmissions along with Medicare's ongoing efforts and future activities to reduce unnecessary readmissions. © 2013 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The Secretary of Health and Human Services (the Secretary) is directed to implement the Board's proposals automatically unless Congress affirmatively acts to alter the Board's proposals or to discontinue the automatic implementation of such proposals. The annual IPAB sequence of events begins each year, starting April 30, 2013, with the Chief Actuary of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services calculating a Medicare per capita growth rate and a Medicare per capita target growth rate. If the Chief Actuary determines that the Medicare per capita growth rate exceeds the Medicare per capita target growth rate, the Chief Actuary would establish an applicable savings target-the amount by which the Board must reduce future spending. This determination by the Chief Actuary also triggers a requirement that the Board prepare a proposal to reduce the growth in the Medicare per capita growth rate by the applicable savings target. The Board cannot ration care, raise premiums, increase cost sharing, or otherwise restrict benefits or modify eligibility. In generating its proposals, the Board is directed to consider, among other things, Medicare solvency, quality and access to care, the effects of changes in payments to providers, and those dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid. If the Board fails to act, the Secretary is directed to prepare a proposal. Board proposals must be submitted to the Secretary by September 1 of each year and to the President and Congress by January 15 of the following year. Board proposals are-fast-tracked"" in Congress, and IPAB proposals go into force automatically unless Congress affirmatively acts to amend or block them within a stated period of time and under circumstances specified in the Act. Section 3403(d) of the Act establishes special-fast track"" parliamentary procedures governing House and Senate committee consideration, and Senate floor consideration, of legislation implementing the Board or Secretary's proposal. These procedures differ from the parliamentary mechanisms the chambers usually use to consider most legislation and are designed to ensure that Congress can act promptly on the implementing legislation should it choose to do so. PPACA also established a second-fast track"" parliamentary mechanism for consideration of legislation discontinuing the automatic implementation process for the recommendations of the Board. The Board's charge is to develop proposals for the Secretary to implement that reduce the per capita growth in Medicare expenditures, not to reduce Medicare expenditures. Therefore, while the Congressional Budget Office projects that the cumulative impact of the Board's recommendations from 2015 through 2019 will reduce total spending by $15.5 billion, during the same period, Medicare expenditures will total $3.9 trillion with average spending per beneficiary forecast to increase from $13,374 to $15,749. While the Board's potential impact on total expenditures is likely to be relatively small compared to overall Medicare expenditures, its impact on particular Medicare providers or suppliers may be significant, particularly if the Board alters payment mechanisms. Finally, the Board's impact may be larger if private insurers continue to track Medicare payment policies and adopt similar reductions in payments to their providers and suppliers. © 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Fragmented care has been found to be, among other things, both costly, since provider payments are not linked to performance or outcomes and services can be duplicative, and of lower quality, since providers lack financial incentives to coordinate care. Section 3022 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (P.L. 111-148, PPACA), as amended, directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (the ""Secretary"") to implement an integrated care delivery model in Medicare, the Medicare Shared Savings Program, using Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs)-a model of integrated care formulated to reduce costs and improve quality. ACOs are modeled on integrated delivery systems such as the Mayo Clinic, Geisinger Health System, Kaiser Permanente, and Intermountain Healthcare. While ACOs can be designed with varying features, most models put primary care physicians at the core, along with other providers, and emphasize simultaneously reducing costs and improving quality. The emphasis is on physicians rather than insurers or hospitals because physicians influence almost 90%of all personal health spending. In the simplest case, the ACO contracts with payers to be accountable for the entire continuum of care provided to a defined population, and if the costs of care provided are less than targeted amounts, and certain quality measures are achieved, the ACO and the payer will share the savings generated. Under the Medicare Shared Savings Program, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) will contract for ACOs to assume responsibility for improving quality of care provided, coordinating care across providers, and reducing the cost of care Medicare beneficiaries receive. If cost and quality targets are met, ACOs will receive a share of any savings realized by CMS. The Congressional Budget Office scored the Medicare Shared Savings Program as reducing Medicare expenditures $4.9 billion in the FY2013 through FY2019 period. PPACA Section 3022 leaves many of the design features to be determined by the Secretary. On March 31, 2011, the Department of Health and Human Services issued its Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for accountable care organizations. At the same time, the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission issued a joint policy statement on ACOs to address antitrust issues. In addition, CMS and the HHS Office of the Inspector General issued a joint statement on the civil monetary penalties law, federal anti-kickback statute, and the physician self-referral law for financial arrangements involving ACOs, and the Internal Revenue Service issued a statement on the participation of tax exempt organizations in ACOs. HHS will accept comments from stakeholders on the NPRM for 60 days and intends to release a final regulation some time afterwards. Appendix A outlines key parts of the proposed regulation, and Appendix B addresses antirust issues. Appendix C discusses the Pioneer ACO Demonstration ""designed for health care organizations and providers that are already experienced in coordinating care for patients across care settings."" The Medicare Shared Savings Program is slated to begin January 1, 2012. While ACOs hold out the prospect of improving care, reducing costs, and raising quality, there are still gaps in knowledge of what existing ACOs have achieved and whether they can be widely replicated. Moreover, there may be unanticipated consequences from encouraging the formation of ACOs, such as further health provider market concentration, that could adversely affect efforts to control overall health costs. © 2012 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Legislative hearings and committee reports ignored the Constitution altogether; legislative debates largely did the same. This Essay both highlights Congress's indifference to the Constitution when enacting the ACA and examines the reasons behind this legislative failure. In particular, this Essay advances three explanations. First, Congress is generally uninterested in ""public goods"" like constitutional interpretation. Second, the polarization of Democrats and Republicans in Congress further depresses Congress's interest in thinking about the Constitution; instead, the majority party seeks to limit opportunities for the minority party to raise constitutional objections to legislation. Third, there is no federalism constituency in Congress that pushes lawmakers to take federalism into account when enacting legislation. For this very reason, Republican lawmakers almost always attacked the ACA on policy, rather than on constitutional, grounds. While embracing these three explanations, this Essay rejects a fourth explanation, namely, that lawmakers had no reason to know that the ACA would be subject to vigorous constitutional attack. Finally, this Essay argues that congressional disinterest in constitutional federalism supports the Supreme Court's establishment of boundaries that limit Congress's Commerce Clause power. At the same time, this Essay does not endorse the action- inaction distinction advanced by five Justices in the ACA decision. © 2012 by Northwestern University School of Law."

An increasing number of schools are contracting with insurance companies to provide students with school-based options for health insurance. Although this is advantageous to students in some ways, tying health insurance coverage to school enrollment can leave students vulnerable when they are most in need of help. Students whose health insurance is contingent upon their enrollment face significant lapses in coverage when they are required to leave school. This is especially challenging for students with mental illnesses whose treatment needs often go unmet in the absence of that coverage.

METHODS In this projection of workforce needs, we used the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey to calculate the use of office-based primary care in 2008. We used US Census Bureau projections to account for demographic changes and the American Medical Association's Masterfile to calculate the number of primary care physicians and determine the number of visits per physician. The main outcomes were the projected number of primary care visits through 2025 and the number of primary care physicians needed to conduct those visits. RESULTS Driven by population growth and aging, the total number of office visits to primary care physicians is projected to increase from 462 million in 2008 to 565 million in 2025. After incorporating insurance expansion, the United States will require nearly 52,000 additional primary care physicians by 2025. Population growth will be the largest driver, accounting for 33,000 additional physicians, while 10,000 additional physicians will be needed to accommodate population aging. Insurance expansion will require more than 8,000 additional physicians, a 3% increase in the current workforce. CONCLUSIONS Population growth will be the greatest driver of expected increases in primary care utilization. Aging and insurance expansion will also contribute to utilization, but to a smaller extent."

Data from the 2003-2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey indicate that approximately one-third (74.5 million) of the adult population 20 years of age or older is hypertensive. In 2010, the estimated direct and indirect cost of hypertension in the United States was $ 76.6 billion, according to the American Heart Association (AHA). The direct medical costs of CV disease may be substantially higher than AHA estimates because of secondary CV hospitalization. Blood pressure control in Americans currently is less than optimal despite the availability of evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of hypertension and a wide variety of antihypertensive drug therapies. Various patient-, provider-, payer-, and pharmacologic-related factors, including patient nonadherence to antihypertensive drug therapy and clinical inertia (the failure of clinicians to initiate or intensify treatment when indicated) prevent optimal blood pressure control in patients with hypertension. These barriers to blood pressure control contribute to excessive health care utilization and costs. The need for health plans to refine population management strategies is emergent as the number of patients with hypertension within health plans is expected to increase; further, government interventions via the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), coupled with pressure from employers, will likely drive changes to population management strategies across chronic conditions, including hypertension. Moreover, the successful treatment of hypertension has been shown to increase life expectancy and reduce health care spending. Aggressive hypertension management using innovative approaches that engage all stakeholders (employers, members, providers, and payers) is needed to overcome the barriers to control and improve outcomes."

To qualify for tax exemption, the IRS requires nonprofit hospitals to allocate a portion of their operating expenses to certain ""charitable"" activities, such as providing free or reduced care to the indigent. Objective: To determine the total amount of community benefit reported by Wisconsin hospitals using official IRS tax return forms (Form 990), and examine the level of allocation across allowable activities. Design: Primary data collection from IRS 990 forms submitted by Wisconsin hospitals for 2009. Main Outcome Measure: Community benefit reported in absolute dollars and as percent of overall hospital expenditures, both overall and by activity category. Results: For 2009, Wisconsin hospitals reported $1.064 billion in community benefits, or 7.52% of total hospital expenditures. Of this amount, 9.1% was for charity care, 50% for Medicaid subsidies, 11.4% for other subsidized services, and 4.4% for Community Health Improvement Services. Conclusion: Charity care is not the primary reported activity by Wisconsin hospitals under the IRS Community Benefit requirement. Opportunities may exist for devoting increasing amounts to broader community health improvement activities. © 2012 Wisconsin Medical Society."

The major PPACA provisions aimed at expanding coverage as well as the populations targeted by those provisions are described. Projections of the impact of PPACA on coverage in the area are based on estimates of growth in the size of targeted populations in each county and the anticipated responses of those populations to the major provisions of PPACA. The projections indicate that, if fully implemented, PPACA could cut the uninsurance rate in the region by half, from 26% in 2010 to 13% in 2020. This change translates into health insurance coverage for approximately 2 million additional people, from the current 4.2 million to a projected 5.9 million. The number of Medicaid enrollees could increase by an estimated 600,000 (a 79% increase), although private insurance coverage, which could increase by as much as 1 million enrollees (a 30% increase), will remain the primary source of coverage for most people. Coverage gains from PPACA will vary considerably by county, depending on the age-income-citizenship characteristics of the population, current uninsurance rates, and the rate of population growth."

This exemp-tion provides an opening for small employers with healthier workers to avoid broader sharing of health care risk, isolating higher-cost groups in the fully insured market. Private stop-loss or reinsurance plans can mediate the risk of self-insurance for small employ-ers, facilitating the decision to self-insure. We simulate small-employer coverage decisions under the law and find that low-risk stop-loss policies lead to higher premiums in the fully insured small-group market. Average single premiums would be up to 25 percent higher, if stop-loss insurance with no additional risk to employers than fully insuring is allowed--an option available in most states absent further government action. Regulation of stop-loss at the federal or state level can, however, prevent such adverse selection and increase stabil-ity in small-group insurance coverage."

After an introduction to the ACA and its vulnerabilities the commentary examines the evolution of Medicaid since its 1965 origins as a means-tested concomitant of cash welfare. It shows that Medicaid has been very adaptable as it morphed into a complex categorical program for specific populations or types of care.

The IPAB works by recommending policies to Congress to help Medicare provide better care at a lower cost, including ideas on coordinating care, getting rid of waste in the system, providing incentives for best practices and prioritizing primary care. Congress then has the power to accept or reject these recommendations. However, Congress faces extreme limitations either to enact policies that achieve equivalent savings or to let the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) follow the IPAB's recommendations.

Employers, consultants, and vendors have cited riskcost estimates developed in the 1990s and wondered whether they still hold true. Examining ten of these common health risk factors in a working population, we found that similar relationships between such risks and total medical costs documented in a widely cited study published in 1998 still hold. Based on our sample of 92,486 employees at seven organizations over an average of three years, $82,072,456, or 22.4 percent, of the $366,373,301 spent annually by the seven employers and their employees in the study was attributed to the ten risk factors studied. This amount was similar to almost a quarter of spending linked to risk factors (24.9 percent) in the 1998 study. High risk for depression remained most strongly associated with increased per capita annual medical spending (48 percent, or $2,184, higher). High blood glucose, high blood pressure, and obesity were strongly related to increased health care costs (31.8 percent, 31.6 percent, and 27.4 percent higher, respectively), as were tobacco use, physical inactivity, and high stress. These findings indicate ongoing opportunities for well-designed and properly targeted employer-sponsored health promotion programs to produce substantial savings."

We used a simulation model to analyze the effects of the Shared Savings Program quality measures and performance targets on Medicare costs in a simulated population of patients ages 65-75 with type 2 diabetes.

Medicaid has been at the forefront of this movement. Since 2006 twenty-five states have implemented new payment systems or revised existing ones so that primary care providers can function as patient-centered medical homes. State Medicaid programs are taking a variety of approaches.For example, Minnesota's reforms focus on chronically ill populations, while in Missouri a 90 percent federal match under the Affordable Care Act is helping integrate primary and behavioral health care and address issues of long-term services and supports. These reforms have led to better alignment of payments with performance metrics that emphasize health outcomes, patient satisfaction, and cost containment.

Methods: Conceptual analysis, literature review. Results: A categorical distinction between process- and outcome-based incentives is less crisp than it seems. Both processes and outcomes involve targets, and both are subject to differences - across and within socio-economic groups - in circumstance and perspective. Thus, a spectrum view is more appropriate, in which the fairness of incentive programs increases with the extent of control that people have. The effectiveness of incentives is a further relevant consideration, and some available evidence suggests that incentives closer to the outcome-end of the spectrum can be more effective. Conclusions: Simple distinctions between processes and outcomes by themselves provide little assurance that programs are effective or fair. Effectiveness can and should be assessed empirically. Assessments of fairness should focus on the extent to which an activity or outcome might be feasible and under an individual's control, not on whether it targets a process or outcome. Rigid uniform targets for all are generally less desirable than those that reward person-specific improvement. © 2012 Elsevier Inc."

The health care reform of 2010 is likely to benefit trauma centers by mandating universal health insurance by 2014. However, the financial benefit of this mandate will depend on the reimbursement provided. The study hypothesis was that compensation for the care of uninsured trauma patients at Medicare or Medicaid rates will lead to continuing losses for trauma centers. METHODS: Financial data for first hospitalization were obtained from an urban Level I trauma center for 3 years (n = 6,630; 2006-2008) and linked with clinical information. Patients were grouped into five payments categories: commercial (29%), Medicaid (8%), Medicare (20%), workers' compensation (6%), and uninsured (37%). Prediction models for costs and payments were developed for each category using multiple regression models, adjusting for patient demographics, injury characteristics, complications, and survival. These models were used to predict payments that could be expected if uninsured patients were covered by different insurance types. Results are reported as net margin per patient (payments minus total costs) for each insurance type, with 95% confidence intervals, discounted to 2008 dollar values. RESULTS: Patients were typical for an urban trauma center (median age of 43 years, 66% men, 82% blunt, 5% mortality, and median length of stay 4 days). Overall, the trauma center lost $5,655 per patient, totaling $37.5 million over 3 years. These losses were encountered for patients without insurance ($14,343), Medicare ($4,838), and Medicaid ($15,740). Patients with commercial insurance were profitable ($5,295) as were those with workers' compensation ($6,860). Payments for the care of the uninsured at Medicare/Medicaid levels would lead to continued losses at $2,267 to $4,143 per patient. CONCLUSION: The health care reforms of 2010 would lead to continued losses for trauma centers if uninsured are covered with Medicare/Medicaid-type programs.

Medicare consists of four distinct parts: Part A, or Hospital Insurance (HI); Part B, or Supplementary Medical Insurance (SMI); Part C, or Medicare Advantage (MA); and Part D, the prescription drug benefit. The Part A program is financed primarily through payroll taxes levied on current workers and their employers; these are credited to the HI trust fund. The Part B program is financed through a combination of monthly premiums paid by current enrollees and general revenues. Income from these sources is credited to the SMI trust fund. Beneficiaries can choose to receive all their Medicare services, except hospice, through managed care plans under the MA program; payment is made on their behalf in appropriate parts from the HI and SMI trust funds. A separate account in the SMI trust fund accounts for the Part D drug benefit; Part D is financed through general revenues, beneficiary premiums, and state contributions. The HI and SMI trust funds are overseen by a board of trustees that makes annual reports to Congress. The 2012 report of the Medicare Board of Trustees estimates that the HI trust fund will become insolvent in 2024, the same as it had predicted in the 2011 report. This recent projection still postpones depletion further in the future than the year of 2017, as projected in the 2009 report prior to the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA, P.L. 111-148), as amended, but earlier than the 2029 date estimated in the 2010 report immediately after the ACA's enactment. Because of the way it is financed, the SMI fund cannot face insolvency; however, the trustees project that SMI expenditures will continue to grow rapidly, and thus place increasing demands on Medicare beneficiaries and all taxpayers. The trustees estimate that total Medicare costs will increase from 3.7% of GDP in 2011 to 6.7% in 2086. Although the Medicare trustees report that the financial outlook for the Medicare program appears to have improved as a result of ACA, they caution that the projections in the report are more uncertain than normal, due to the potential for future expenditure reductions not to materialize. In addition, the report projections assume that reductions in physician payment rates scheduled under current law will occur, although these reductions have usually been overridden by Congress. As such, as it has done each year subsequent to the enactment of ACA, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Office of the Actuary issued a supplemental analysis that provides projections based on an ""illustrative alternative"" to current law. © 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The ethical dilemma in health care is how to balance the precepts of autonomy, beneficence, and distributive justice. Rationing may affect three dimensions of coverage: the share of the population covered, the services covered, and the extent to which services are covered. United States: The US spends 50 percent more per capita on health care than any other country while achieving worse health than many. Poorly coordinated insurance mechanisms leave 19 percent of the population uninsured. Until passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) in 2010, health care was effectively a privilege, not a right. While PPACA seeks to rectify this, by 2019 five percent of non-elderly US residents will likely remain uninsured. Europe: Most European countries provide universal or near-universal population coverage to people resident in the respective country. Central and Eastern European countries inherited the Soviet-era commitment to universal coverage free at the point of use. Faced with a decline in government spending on health, almost all of them reduced the scope of services and introduced official user fees. In contrast, other European countries expanded entitlement to publicly funded health care, resulting in greater equity. A number of countries have attempted to depoliticize decisions on rationing by using health technology assessments and dedicated agencies. Discussion: Resource allocation and rationing differ considerably between the US and Europe. In the US, where social welfare remains controversial, there are few restrictions on the use of health care technology regardless of cost or clinical effectiveness. European countries engage in more explicit debates about these limits, though these are complicated by media and lobby power. Conclusion: The ethical issues in the US largely revolve around rationing care by eligibility for insurance coverage, whereas in Europe they are more concerned with the scope of publicly funded services to all. On both sides of the Atlantic, public debates are needed about the financial sustainability of health systems, the tradeoffs between cost-containment and broader societal and health system goals, the role of the welfare state, and the limits of publicly financed health care."

By bringing back the concept of a true primary care physician, who provides 90% of your care and coordinates with your specialists, these programs are bending the curve of health care cost trends. Most are seeing a reduction in emergency room visits and hospital days in the double digits. Others that are taking fee-for-service insurance out of the picture altogether are experiencing even higher reduction rates. The goal is to increase patient health, which includes the patient having an active role in understanding his or her condition, treatment options and self-care strategies.

Discussions of health-status discrimination permeated the debate surrounding health-care reform, infusing those conversations with the language of civil rights. Insurance, however, is by its very nature discriminatory. Thus, an antidiscrimination paradigm is not the appropriate normative framework for addressing disparities in health-insurance coverage. For-profit health insurance has historically disadvantaged individuals based on health status through risk-assessment and cost-sharing mechanisms. Proponents of health-care reform vilified these accepted business practices as producing untenable discrimination against the sick. Congress, therefore, adopted an antidiscrimination framework in the AC A. Specifically, the statute forbids insurers from considering health-related factors in their rating and underwriting decisions. Yet these protections will ultimately fail to eliminate the disparities experienced by the sick in health insurance. As of 2014, individual and small-group insurers may base their rating decisions on criteria including age, geographic location, and tobacco use, and large-group insurers may consider participation in wellness programs. These new rating mechanisms approximate health status, thereby disadvantaging the same populations as the existing system. Thus, while the AC A may end health-status discrimination on its face, it will not in its effect. Consequently, this Article proposes an alternate normative framework, grounded in a universal right to basic health-insurance coverage, to address the problem of un- and underinsured Americans. It concludes by teasing out examples of the universal right paradigm within the AC A and exploring how Congress could improve those provisions to ensure that more Americans carry baseline health insurance."

In response, some insurers ceased to offer coverage to children in need of individual health insurance, known as a ""child-only"" pol-icy. This issue brief examines new state legislative and regulatory action to promote the availability of child-only policies in response to this market disruption. The analysis finds that 22 states and the District of Columbia passed new legislation or issued a new regula-tion or subregulatory guidance. As a result, child-only coverage is available in nearly all of these states. These findings suggest that states have flexibility to take innovative actions to maintain or improve their markets and insurers are highly sensitive to the risk of adverse selection.

Methods: Medicaid programs were surveyed regarding their coverage for tobacco-dependence treatments after the ACA provisions went into effect. Results: From 2009 to 2010, coverage for tobacco-dependence treatments increased from 43 to 51 programs covering pharmacotherapy treatments and from 30 to 38 programs covering tobacco-cessation counseling.

This law structurally reforms the US health care system by encouraging universal health care coverage through regulated competition among private insurance companies. When looking at the process for reform, what strikes an observer of US health care policy in the first place is that the Democratic majority was able to enact something in a political field characterized by strong resistance to change. This article builds on that observation. Arguments concentrate on the legislative process of the reform and support the idea that it may be partly explained by considering an evolution of US legislative institutions, mostly in the sense of a more centralized legislative process. Based on approximately one hundred semidirected interviews, I argue that the Democratic majority, building on lessons from both President Bill Clinton's health care reform attempt and the Republicans' strategy of using strong congressional leadership to pass social reforms, was able to overcome institutional constraints that have long prevented comprehensive change.

Nearly one-in-three young adults lacked coverage before the ACA. Study Design, Methods, and Data Data from the Current Population Survey 2005-2011 are used to estimate linear probability models within a difference-in-differences framework to estimate how the ACA affected coverage of eligible young adults compared to slightly older adults. Multivariate models control for individual characteristics, economic trends, and prior state-dependent coverage laws. Principal Findings This ACA provision led to a rapid and substantial increase in the share of young adults with dependent coverage and a reduction in their uninsured rate in the early months of implementation. Models accounting for prior state dependent expansions suggest greater policy impact in 2010 among young adults who were also eligible under a state law. Conclusions and Implications ACA-dependent coverage expansion represents a rare public policy success in the effort to cover the uninsured.

The primary objective of this study was to estimate the number of low-income women who would gain health insurance after implementation of the ACA and thus be able to obtain cancer screening. A secondary objective was to estimate the size and characteristics of the uninsured low-income population and the number of women who would still need National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program (NBCCEDP) services. Methods: We used the nationally representative 2009 American Community Survey to estimate the determinants of insurance status for women in Massachusetts, assuming full implementation of the ACA. We extrapolated findings to simulate the effects of the ACA on each state. We used individual-level predicted probabilities of being uninsured to generate estimates of the number of women who would gain health insurance after implementation of the ACA and to predict demand for NBCCEDP services. Results: Approximately 6.8 million low-income women would gain health insurance, potentially increasing the annual demand for cancer screenings initially by about 500,000 mammograms and 1.3 million Papanicolaou tests. Despite a 60% decrease in the number of low-income uninsured women, the NBCCEDP would still serve fewer than one-third of the estimated number of women eligible for services. The NBCCEDP-eligible population would comprise a larger number of women with language and literacy-related barriers to care. Conclusion: Implementation of the ACA would increase insurance coverage and access to cancer screening for millions of women, but the NBCCEDP will remain essential for the millions who will remain uninsured."

First, education is a minor issue in this election and would be a secondary concern for a Republican President focused on economic growth, the deficit, tax cuts, and reversing the Affordable Care Act. Second, there are few stark differences between Mitt Romney and President Obama when it comes to education. Both support more transparency, endorse charter schools, support more intensive teacher evaluation and differentiated pay, and insist that something needs to be done about persistently low-performing schools. Third, some caution is required in divining Romney's core beliefs. © 2012."

DATA SOURCES:: The American Hospital Association's Annual Survey and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' case mix index for fiscal years 2005 through 2008 were used. STUDY DESIGN:: A Malmquist approach was used to assess hospitals' productivity in the United States and Massachusetts over the sample period. Propensity score matching is used to ""simulate"" a randomized control group of hospitals from other markets to compare with Massachusetts. Comparisons are then made to examine if productivity differences are due to universal health insurance coverage mandate. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:: In the early stages, Massachusetts' coverage mandates lead to a significant drop in hospitals' productivity relative to comparable facilities in other states. In 2008, Massachusetts functioned 3.53% below its 2005 level, whereas facilities across the United States have seen a 4.06% increase over the same period. CONCLUSIONS:: If the individual mandate is implemented nationwide, the Massachusetts' experience indicates that a near-term decrease in overall hospital productivity will occur. As such, current cost estimates of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act's impact on overall health spending are potentially understated. © 2012 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins."

The bill sets annual state spending targets, encourages the formation of accountable care organizations, and establishes an independent commission to oversee health care system performance. It is Massachusetts's third law to address health spending since the state's landmark health insurance coverage reforms in 2006. The 2012 legislation is a notable step beyond other recent cost control efforts. Although it lacks strong mechanisms to enforce the new spending goals, it creates a framework for increased regulation if spending trends fail to moderate. Massachusetts's experience provides several lessons for state and federal policy makers. First, implementing near-universal coverage, as is planned under the Affordable Care Act for 2014, will increase pressure on government to begin controlling overall health care spending. Second, introduction of cost control measures takes time: Massachusetts enacted a series of incremental but increasingly strong laws over the past six years that have gradually increased its ability to influence health spending. Finally, the effectiveness of new cost control laws will depend on changes in providers' and insurers' behavior; in Massachusetts, private market activity has had a complementary impact on the pace of health system change. © 2012 Project HOPE-The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc."

However, a recent survey by the Practice Management Committee of the Pediatric Orthopaedic Society of North America found that new referrals were often for cases that could have been managed by primary care practitioners. We wished to determine how many new referral cases seen by pediatric orthopaedic surgeons are in fact conditions that can be readily managed by a primary care physician should he/she chose to do so. METHODS: We prospectively studied all new referrals to our hospital-based orthopaedic clinic during August 2010. Each new referral was evaluated for whether it met the American Board of Pediatrics criteria for being a condition that could be managed by a primary care pediatrician. Each referral was also evaluated for whether it met the American Academy of Pediatrics Surgery Advisory Panel guidelines recommending referral to an orthopaedic specialist, regardless of whether it is for general orthopaedics or pediatric orthopaedics. On the basis of these criteria, we classified conditions as either a condition manageable by primary care physicians or a condition that should be referred to an orthopaedic surgeon or a pediatric orthopaedic surgeon. We used these guidelines not to identify diagnosis that primary care physicians should treat but, rather, to compare the guideline-delineated referrals with the actual referrals our specialty pediatric orthopaedic clinic received over a period of 1 month. RESULTS: A total of 529 new patient referrals were seen during August 2010. A total of 246 (47%) were considered primary care conditions and 283 (53%) orthopaedic specialty conditions. The most common primary care condition was a nondisplaced phalanx fracture (25/246, 10.1%) and the most common specialty condition was a displaced single-bone upper extremity fracture needing reduction (36/283, 13%). Only 77 (14.6%) of the total cases met the strict American Academy of Pediatrics Surgery Advisory Panel guidelines recommending referral to pediatric orthopaedics, with scoliosis being the most frequent condition. For 38 (7.2%) cases, surgical treatment was required or recommended. Patient age, referral source, or type of insurance did not influence whether the condition was a primary care or a specialty care case. A total of 134 (25%) cases were referred without having an initial diagnosis made by the referring clinician. These patients were more likely to have been referred from a primary care practitioner than from a tertiary care practitioner whether the diagnosis eventually made was considered to be a primary care condition (P=0.03; relative risk, 1.9; 95% confidence interval, 96-3.86). CONCLUSIONS: Almost half of all new referrals to a tertiary pediatric orthopaedic clinic were for conditions considered to be manageable by primary care physicians should they chose to do so. SIGNIFICANCE: This has implications for pediatric orthopaedic workforce availability, reimbursement under the Affordable Care Act, and pediatric musculoskeletal training needs for providers of primary care.

The outpouring of aid helped states to avoid cutting spending and increasing taxes in the depths of the Great Recession. Federal grants dramatically increased as a percentage of total state revenues, from 26 percent to 35 percent. The fiscal relief packages were harbingers for the future, because 70 percent of the federal grants were devoted to health and education. But the relief supplied by the federal stimulus was short-lived. The expected ""new normal"" revenue path means that states will continue to downsize and streamline along all fronts. Health-care spending holds the key. Existing health programs and the new Affordable Care Act, if is fully implemented, will mean that 130 million individuals will look to the states to help meet or, at least, control health-care costs. That is the difficult and expensive mission confronting the states in the future. © 2012 by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved."

The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 (GINA) is designed to prohibit the improper use of genetic information in health insurance and employment. GINA prohibits group health plans and health insurers from denying coverage to a healthy individual, or from charging that person a higher premium based solely on a genetic predisposition to developing a disease in the future. The broader health care reform of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act requires the private health insurance market to provide coverage for individuals with preexisting conditions. The chapter considers the CaSE model as a framework for representing causation and then applies it to the case of genetic diseases. It concludes by asking whether preexisting conditions-genetic or otherwise-should be grounds for denying someone health insurance. © Oxford University Press 2012. All rights reserved."

Yet the effect of such changes on adults' health remains unclear. We examined whether Medicaid expansions were associated with changes in mortality and other healthrelated measures. Methods: We compared three states that substantially expanded adult Medicaid eligibility since 2000 (New York, Maine, and Arizona) with neighboring states without expansions. The sample consisted of adults between the ages of 20 and 64 years who were observed 5 years before and after the expansions, from 1997 through 2007. The primary outcome was all-cause county-level mortality among 68,012 year- and countyspecific observations in the Compressed Mortality File of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Secondary outcomes were rates of insurance coverage, delayed care because of costs, and self-reported health among 169,124 persons in the Current Population Survey and 192,148 persons in the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Results: Medicaid expansions were associated with a significant reduction in adjusted allcause mortality (by 19.6 deaths per 100,000 adults, for a relative reduction of 6.1%; P = 0.001). Mortality reductions were greatest among older adults, nonwhites, and residents of poorer counties. Expansions increased Medicaid coverage (by 2.2 percentage points, for a relative increase of 24.7%; P = 0.01), decreased rates of uninsurance (by 3.2 percentage points, for a relative reduction of 14.7%; P<0.001), decreased rates of delayed care because of costs (by 2.9 percentage points, for a relative reduction of 21.3%; P = 0.002), and increased rates of self-reported health status of ""excellent"" or ""very good"" (by 2.2 percentage points, for a relative increase of 3.4%; P = 0.04). Conclusions: State Medicaid expansions to cover low-income adults were significantly associated with reduced mortality as well as improved coverage, access to care, and selfreported health.

The current economic environment will impact not only current colorectal surgery residents, but also future generations of surgical trainees. To understand the economic impact of the current health care environment on colorectal surgery residencies, we need to know the basics of graduate medical education (GME) funding for all residents. Since the 1960s with the initiation of Medicare, the federal government through the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has been the largest source of GME funding. There are two types of costs associated with GME. Direct GME (DME) funding covers costs directly attributed to the training of residents. These costs include residents' stipends, salaries, and benefits; cost of supervising faculty; direct program administration costs; overhead; and malpractice coverage. Indirect GME (IME) costs are payments to hospitals as an additional or add-on payment for the increased cost of care that is generally found in teaching hospitals. In 2010, President Barak Obama signed into law H.R. 3200, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA). In 2011, the Supreme Court held that the majority of the PPACA is constitutional.

Nearly 78,000 people have enrolled since the program was implemented two years ago. This issue brief compares the PCIP with state-based high-risk pools that existed prior to the Affordable Care Act and considers programmatic differences that may have resulted in lower-than-anticipated enrollment and higher-than-anticipated costs for the PCIP. PCIP coverage, like state high-risk pool coverage, likely remains unaffordable to most lower-income individuals with preexisting conditions, but provides much needed access to care for those able to afford it. Operational costs of these programs are also quite high, making them less than optimal as a means of broader coverage expansion."

To this end, the act allowed introduction of bundled payments for a range of services, proposed the creation of accountable care organizations (ACOs), and established the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation to test new care delivery and payment models. The ACO program began April 1, 2012, along with demonstration projects for bundled payments for episodes of care in Medicaid. Yet even before many components of the Affordable Care Act are fully in place, the Medicare ESRD Program has instituted legislatively mandated changes for dialysis services that resemble many of these care delivery reform proposals. The ESRD program now operates under a fully bundled, case-mix adjusted prospective payment system and has implemented Medicare's first-ever mandatory pay-for-performance program: the ESRD Quality Incentive Program. As ACOs are developed, they may benefit from the nephrology community's experience with these relatively novel models of health care payment and delivery reform. Nephrologists are in a position to assure that the ACO development will benefit from the ESRD experience. This article reviews the new ESRD payment system and the Quality Incentive Program, comparing and contrasting them with ACOs. Better understanding of similarities and differences between the ESRD program and the ACO program will allow the nephrology community to have a more influential voice in shaping the future of health care delivery in the United States. © 2012 by the American Society of Nephrology."

Sebelius 1 the health law ""case of the century,"" but that title would not be hyperbolic. Never before have we seen a case of such monumental importance for how health care is financed and delivered in the United States. At the Supreme Court, no decision has been more closely watched and more anxiously awaited since Bush v. Gore in 2000. In the balance was the fate of President Obama's signature piece of domestic legislation, one that affects nearly every aspect of the largest segment of our economy, and so is perhaps the most important piece of social legislation since the New Deal. To no one's surprise, the decision was announced at the very end of the Court's term and was split five to four. What was very surprising, however, was the Court's embrace of the tax power defense of the individual mandate. And what was outright shocking was a seven-to-two majority in favor of finding the Medicaid expansion unconstitutional unless states are allowed to opt out of the expansion. The case holds great significance not only for the fate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act-and, thus, for the nation's health care public policy-but also for constitutional doctrine that applies much more broadly than in the health care arena. © 2012 by The Hastings Center."

In addition to reducing annual payment increases to providers under the existing prospective payment systems, the act calls for demonstration projects of bundled payment, accountable care organizations, and other strategies to promote care coordination and reduce spending. Experience with the adoption of Medicare prospective payment systems in postacute care settings approximately a decade ago suggests that current reforms could, but need not necessarily, produce such undesirable effects as decreased access for less profitable patients, poorer patient outcomes, and only short-lived curbs on spending. Policy makers will need to be vigilant in monitoring the impact of the Affordable Care Act reforms and be prepared to amend policies as necessary to ensure that the reforms exert persistent controls on spending without compromising the delivery of patient-appropriate postacute services."

This article provides an overview of models supported by the Affordable Care Act that address one or more goals of the ""Triple Aim"": better health care for individuals, better health outcomes in the community, and lower health care costs. The models described below rely on the core principles of primary care: comprehensive, coordinated and continuous primary care; preventive care; and the sophisticated implementation of health information technology designed to promote communication between health care providers, enhance coordination of care, minimize duplication of services, and permit reporting on quality. These models will support better health care and reduced costs for people who access health care services but will not address health outcomes in the community at large. Health care professionals, working in concert with community-based organizations and advocates, must also address conditions that influence health in the broadest sense to truly improve the health of our communities and reduce health care costs.

The primary purpose of the mandate in my work and in arguments for the mandate in Massachusetts was to try to get as many people as possible to have at least some insurance coverage.

Much of the opposition is grounded in popular hostility to expansive federal control over individuals' health care decision-making. But the new law reinforces existing third-party payment, primarily through employers and government programs. This financing already restricts personal choice of health plans and coverage options. Private employers, managed care executives, and public officials make the key spending decisions in health care. Unlike consumers in other sectors of the economy, individuals are mostly passive spectators. Normal market dynamics do not exist, and consumer choice is frustrated. Curiously, public programs, such as the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP), the Medicare Advantage Program, and the Medicare Part D Drug program, are the main exceptions to the norm. In these programs, individuals control the flow of dollars over the purchase of health plans. In crucial areas such as access to care and benefits, cost control, quality, and patient satisfaction, these programs have a strong record. By realigning health reform with the primacy of personal choice, and building on the experience of these programs, policymakers can expand consumer control through defined-contribution financing.

One path, which the solicitor general pursued, was to cautiously navigate judicial precedents, claim the barest increment of new congressional authority, and give the Supreme Court as many hooks as possible on which to hang a favorable decision. The road not traveled was to offer a full-throated defense of federal authority to comprehensively regulate the U.S. health care system, a multitrillion dollar commercial and social enterprise that represents the largest component of federal expenditure after national defense. The ACA has three cornerstones. First, make health insurance coverage as widespread as possible. Second, improve the quality and efficiency of health care delivery. Third, make individuals and communities healthier. The second and third pillars are sometimes overlooked because so much attention is paid to expanding coverage, but the hallmark of the ACA is that it combines major changes to health insurance, health care delivery, and health in a single piece of federal legislation. The Obama administration's timidity echoes what is strikingly absent from the new law.

ACA has substantially changed the landscape of medical practice in the United States and continues to influence all sectors, in particular evolving specialties such as interventional pain management. ObamaCare has been signed into law amidst major political fallouts, has sustained a Supreme Court challenge and emerged bruised, but still very much alive. While proponents argue that ObamaCare will provide insurance for almost everyone, with an improvement in the quality of and reduction in the cost of health care, opponents criticize it as being a massive bureaucracy laden with penalties and taxes, that will ultimately eliminate personal medicine and individual practices. Based on the 2 years since the passage of ACA in 2010, the prognosis for interventional pain management is unclear. The damage sustained to interventional pain management and the majority of medicine practices is irreparable. ObamaCare may provide insurance for all, but with cuts in Medicare to fund ObamaCare, a limited expansion of Medicaid, the inadequate funding of exchanges, declining employer health insurance coverage and skyrocketing disability claims, the coverage will be practically nonexistent. ObamaCare is composed of numerous organizations and bureaucracies charged with controlling the practice of medicine through the extension of regulations. Apart from cutting reimbursements and reducing access to interventional pain management, administration officials are determined to increase the role of midlevel practitioners and reduce the role of individual physicians by liberalizing the scope of practice regulations and introducing proposals to reduce medical education and training."

Reforms include per episode bundled payment and elements of capitation, such as global payments or accountable care organizations. But even if these approaches succeed and are widely adopted, the core method of payment to many physicians for the services they provide is likely to remain fee-for-service. It is therefore critical to address the current shortcomings in the Medicare physician fee schedule, because it will affect physician incentives and will continue to play an important role in determining the payment amounts under payment reform. This article reviews how the current payment system developed and is applied, and it highlights areas that require careful review and modification to ensure the success of broader payment reform. © 2012 Project HOPE- The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc."

Further, the high court's decision to leave the law's Medicaid expansion provisions up to the states leaves hospitals and EDs in a particularly precarious position as they will still face mandated cuts that the law's authors anticipated would be offset by Medicaid dollars. Experts recommend that ED administrators prepare for continued stress on their departments and get involved with shaping the way emergency medicine fits into ACOs and other emerging models of care. Some experts predict that EDs will see a flood of new patients when the Medicaid expansion provisions go into effect in 2014, but this trend may be tempered by the fact that newly insured patients will be able to seek care in other settings. The health reform transition is expected to be most difficult in states with large uninsured populations, and experts agree that a shortage of primary care physicians will drive ED volume in many communities. Hospitals and health care business interests are putting pressure on states to opt in to the ACA's Medicaid expansion provisions because it will make federal dollars available to cover 100% of the cost to cover newly insured Medicaid patients for three years, and 90% of the cost after that."

This case study examines a care model jointly developed by a provider and a payer that approximates an accountable care organization for a Medicare Advantage population. The collaboration between Aetna and NovaHealth, an independent physician association based in Portland, Maine, focused on shared data, financial incentives, and care management to improve health outcomes for approximately 750 Medicare Advantage members. The patient population in the pilot program had 50 percent fewer hospital days per 1,000 patients, 45 percent fewer admissions, and 56 percent fewer readmissions than statewide unmanaged Medicare populations. NovaHealth's total per member per month costs across all cost categories for its Aetna Medicare Advantage members were 16.5 percent to 33 percent lower than costs for members not in this provider organization. Clinical quality metrics for diabetes, ischemic vascular disease, annual office visits, and postdischarge followup for patients in the program were consistently high. The experience of developing and implementing this collaborative care model suggests that several components are key, including robust data sharing and information systems that support it, analytical support, care management and coordination, and joint strategic planning with close provider-payer collaboration. © 2012 Project HOPE-The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc."

Adopting a global payment (GP) mechanism may dampen the high number of procedures incentivized by the fee-for-service (FFS) system. The evolving payment mechanism should reflect collaboration between surgeon and system goals. Our aim was to model and perform simulation of a GP system for hernia care and its impact on cost, revenue, and physician reimbursement in an integrated health care system. The results of the 2006 Watchful Waiting (WW) vs Repair of Inguinal Hernia in Minimally Symptomatic Men trial was used as a clinical model for the natural history and progression of inguinal hernia disease Simulations were built using 2009 financial and clinical data from the Cambridge Health Alliance to model costs and revenues in managing care for a 4-year cohort of inguinal hernia patients; FFS, FFS-WW, and the GP-WW were modeled. To build this GP model, surgeons were paid a constant $500 per patient whether herniorrhaphy was performed or not. Compared with the actual combined physician and hospital revenue under the current FFS model ($308,820), implementing the FFS-WW system for 4 years for 139 hernia patients decreased hospital and physician revenues by $93,846 and $19,308, respectively. This resulted in a total savings of $113,154 for the payors only. In contrast, when using WW methodology within a GP model, system savings of $69,174 were observed after 4 years, with preservation of physician and hospital income.

These nonphysicians did not possess the necessary licenses, certifications, credentials, or training to perform the services. Since the time the medical profession was founded, advances in treatments and technology, as well as educational and training standards, have promoted a desire to go beyond the basic scope of practice. Many have sought to broaden the scope of practice through legislative efforts and proclamation rather than education and training. In 2001, President Clinton signed into law a rule that permitted states to ""opt out"" of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' (CMS) requirement for nurse anesthetists to be supervised by any physician. Since then, 17 states have adopted this rule. While it was originally intended to help rural areas improve access to care, the opt out rule essentially supports any hospital or organization that seeks to make a profit or cut costs by allowing nurse anesthetists to function as physicians. With the implementation of sweeping health care regulations under the Affordable Care Act (ACA, also popularly known as Obamacare), the future of nurses and other professionals has been empowered. In fact, it has been proposed that medical training may be reduced by 30%, which will in their minds equalize training between nonphysicians and physicians. In 2010, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) issued an opinion exerting their power to empower CRNAs with unlimited practice, with threats to opposing parties. In the 2013 proposed physician payment rule, CMS is proposing that CRNAs may perform interventional pain management services. Interventional pain management is a medical discipline with defined interventional techniques to be performed by professionals who are well trained and qualified. Without considering the consequences of the lack of education and training qualifications for CRNAs to offer interventional techniques, the FTC issued their opinion and CMS proposed to expand these practice patterns with a policy of improved access and reduced cost. However, in reality, the opposite will happen and will increase fraud, reduce access due to inappropriate procedures, and increase complications, all as a result of privileges by legislation without education. The CMS proposal for interventional pain management by nurse anesthetists is a proclamation with a poor prognosis."

The program-administered by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)- supports four types of health centers: (1) community health centers; (2) health centers for the homeless; (3) health centers for residents of public housing; and (4) migrant health centers. According to HRSA data, there are over 8,633 unique health center sites (i.e., unique health center facility locations). Facilities must meet a number of requirements to receive a Section 330 grant, but receiving these grants enables health centers to receive services or in-kind benefits from a number of federal programs. Appropriations for the health center program have increased over the past decade, resulting in more centers and more patients served. From FY2000 through FY2012 the health center program's appropriation increased by 48%. Over this same time period, the number of health center sites increased by 59%. The program also received supplemental appropriations through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (P.L. 111-5) in FY2009. The program's expansion may continue under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-148, ACA), which permanently authorized the health center program and created the Community Health Center Fund (CHCF) that included a total of $9.5 billion for health center operations to be appropriated in FY2011 through FY2015. However, it is not clear whether these funds will be used to expand the health center program because in FY2011, FY2012, and the FY2013 President's Budget request, these funds were or would be used to augment discretionary appropriation reductions to the health center program. Health centers are required to provide health care to all individuals regardless of their ability to pay and are required to be located in geographic areas that have few health care providers. These requirements make health centers part of the health safety net-providers that serve the uninsured, the underserved, or those enrolled in Medicaid. Data compiled by HRSA demonstrate that health centers serve the intended safety net population as the majority of patients are uninsured or enrolled in Medicaid. Some research also suggests that health centers are a cost effective way of meeting this population's health needs because researchers have found that patients seen at health centers have lower health care costs than those served in other settings. In general, research has found that health centers, among other outcomes, improve health, reduce costs, and provide access to health care for populations that may otherwise not obtain health care. This report provides an overview of the federal health center program including its statutory authority, program requirements, and appropriation levels. The report then describes health centers in general, where they are located, their patient population, and some outcomes associated with health center use. It also describes some federal programs available to assist health center operations including the federally qualified health center (FQHC) designation for Medicare and Medicaid payments. The report then concludes with a brief discussion of issues for Congress such as the potential effects of the ACA on health centers, the health center workforce, and financial considerations for health centers in the context of changing federal and state budgets. Finally, the report has two appendixes that describe (1) FQHC payments for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries served at health centers; and (2) programs that are similar to health centers but not authorized in Section 330 of the PHSA. © 2012 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

These medicines have added notable therapeutic options for many diseases and impacted fields such as oncology and rheumatology. The biologics industry invests extensively in R&D and contributes to a rapidly expanding market for these treatments. Biologics are often costly, however, in part due to the sophistication of the technologies and the manufacturing techniques needed to make them. Some commentators have also observed that, in contrast to the generic drugs available in traditional pharmaceutical markets, few ""follow-on"" biologics compete with the original, brand-name product. The lack of competition in the biologics markets is perceived to be a consequence of the complexity of biologics in comparison with small-molecule, chemical-based pharmaceuticals. As a result, previously existing accelerated marketing provisions for traditional generic drugs provided under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act do not comfortably apply to biologics. Congress turned to these concerns when it enacted the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA) of 2009. The BPCIA was incorporated into Title VII of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The BPCIA included three significant components. First, the BPCIA established a licensure pathway for competing versions of previously marketed biologics. In particular, the legislation established a regulatory regime for two sorts of follow-on biologics, termed ""biosimilar"" and ""interchangeable"" biologics. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was afforded a prominent role in determining the particular standards for biosimilarity and interchangeability for individual products. Second, the BPCIA created FDA-administered periods of data protection and marketing exclusivity for certain brand-name drugs and follow-on products. Brand-name biologic products receive 4 years of marketing exclusivity and 12 years of data protection. The BPCIA also provides for a term of marketing exclusivity for the applicant that is the first to establish that its product is interchangeable with the brand-name product. Finally, the BPCIA created a patent dispute resolution procedure for use by brand-name and follow-on biologic manufacturers. A core issue concerning the BPCIA is its ability to preserve innovation while also stimulating competition in the biologics market. Some observers believe that due to the unique nature of biologics and their manufacture, the follow-on biologics market may not yield the same level of savings seen with small-molecule generic drugs. In contrast with traditional generic drugs, more clinical trials may be required, manufacturing methods may be more difficult to replicate in distinct facilities, and follow-on firms may be exposed to higher marketing costs. Whether industry will make extensive use of the BPCIA's follow-on approval pathway also is not yet certain. Resolution of the scientific and legal issues that the BPCIA raises will likely engage the courts and the FDA for many years to come. It may also take some time for members of the biologics industry to develop a working familiarity and appropriate strategies within the BPCIA framework. As a result, marketplace availability of significant numbers of follow-on biologics may not be a short-term proposition. © Nova Scicence Publishers, Inc."

Most enter care because they have experienced neglect or abuse by their parents. Between 35% and 60% of children entering foster care have at least one chronic or acute physical health condition that needs treatment. As many as one-half to three-fourths show behavioral or social competency problems that may warrant mental health services. Many health and mental health needs persist. A national survey of children adopted from foster care found that 54% had special health care needs and research on youth who aged out of foster care shows these young adults are more likely than their peers to report having a health condition that limits their daily activities and to participate in psychological and substance abuse counseling. The Social Security Act addresses some of the health care needs of children in, or formerly in, foster care through provisions in the titles pertaining to child welfare (Titles IV-B and IV-E) and to the Medicaid program (Title XIX). Under child welfare law, state child welfare agencies are required to have a written plan for each child in foster care that includes, among other items, the child's regularly reviewed and updated health-related records. In addition, state child welfare agencies, in cooperation with state Medicaid agencies, must develop a strategy that addresses the health care needs of each child in foster care. Upon aging out of foster care, youth must receive from the state child welfare agency a copy of their health record and information about health insurance options and designating other individuals to make health care decisions on their behalf if they are unable to do so on their own. States are not permitted to use federal child welfare program funds to pay medical expenses of children in care or those who left foster care due to their age or placement in a new permanent family. However, states can (and do) receive reimbursement through Medicaid to pay a part of the medical expenses, including well-child visits and other benefits, for many of these children and youth. Most children in foster care are eligible for Medicaid under mandatory eligibility pathways, meaning that states must provide coverage because these children meet low-income and other eligibility criteria. Children in foster care who are not eligible under mandatory pathways generally qualify for Medicaid because the state has implemented one or more optional eligibility categories allowing coverage. Further, some children who leave foster care for legal guardianship remain eligible for Medicaid on a mandatory basis, as do most children with state-defined ""special needs"" who leave foster care for adoption. The income and resources of the child's guardian or adoptive parent are not considered under this eligibility pathway. Separately, youth who age out of foster care may be eligible for Medicaid through one of the mandatory eligibility pathways that are available to adults generally. States also have the option of providing Medicaid to youth up to the age of 21 if they aged out of foster care. However, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA, P.L. 111-148, as amended), requires that beginning on January 1, 2014, states must provide Medicaid to young people under the age of 26 who aged out. Unlike most other Medicaid pathways, coverage must be provided without regard to the income and assets of these young people. This new pathway parallels another requirement in ACA that generally directs health insurance companies to continue to provide coverage to children up to age 26 who are enrolled in their parents' health care plans. ACA made additional changes to assist adults in obtaining private health insurance, and young adults leaving foster care may benefit from these changes. ACA may also include new opportunities for providing health insurance to child welfare-involved children and their families, such as those children in foster care who are vulnerable to losing Medicaid upon returning home. © 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

That contention is simply false. Federal criminal law contains scores of provisions that facially or in application punish inactivity by individuals. These criminal statutes regulating inaction include not just traditional crimes by omission, where a common law duty is violated, but also offenses related to registration, record keeping, possession, receipt, preventive measures, nondisclosure, organization, misprision, and obstruction. By providing this account of criminal laws punishing and regulating inactivity, this Essay puts the ACA's insurance mandate in the larger context of federal laws that would be in jeopardy if the mandate were held to be unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. The case of the ACA in regard to the Commerce and Necessary and Proper Clauses is not merely about the enforcement mechanism used for a single health care law as many have contended-it is about the shape and scope of federal criminal law that has been in place for over fifty years."

This case is designed to be taught in four class hours and is expected to require twenty-four hours of outside preparation for students. For the graduate student, it should be a half semester long group project with a presentation and report at the end of the semester. CASE SYNOPSIS: This case study analyzes the turbulent social, legal and technological issues that are affecting today's suburban community hospitals in United States. The soaring health care costs, increasing number of uninsured or underinsured patients, reduced payments by government agencies, and increasing number of physician owned ambulatory care centers are squeezing the lifeline of community hospitals whose traditional mission has been primary care. Furthermore, with the enactment of Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in March 2010, community hospitals are facing new challenges whose full impact is unknown. This case study would help students learn about Strategy Formulation including Vision and Mission Statements, internal and external analysis, and generating, evaluating & selecting appropriate strategies for a healthcare organization."

The Obama Administration's Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) attempts to grapple with both of these problems. One of ACA's key instrumentalities is the Independent Payment Advisory Board-the IPAB, designed to discover and authorize ways to reduce the rate of growth of Medicare and other categories of health spending. The IPAB is a peril. Expert boards to perform regulatory tasks in the interest of efficiency and social goals always run a high risk of being captured by the industry they are supposed to regulate. Even should it succeed at its task of reducing the rate of growth of Medicare spending, who is to say that the reductions will not come at a heavy cost in reduced quantity and effectiveness of medical care? But the IPAB also has promise. The need for a better process than our current specialist-driven one to assign value to the medical services provided by Medicare is great. The bellwether status of Medicare payment systems means that commercial insurance consumers and payors would also benefit mightily from bringing more coherent, technocratic, and cost-effectiveness oriented logic to this process. And the current system of relative Medicare reimbursement rates is, in the judgment of many, currently well out of whack. We quail when we consider the magnitude of the tasks the IPAB faces--even its initial task. Nevertheless, we remain optimistic that this administrative agency will manage to bend the long-run healthcare cost curve and moderate future price increases."

This Article suggests a number of specific changes to encourage provider self-disclosure and proposes that CMS create a demonstration project under the authority of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act to test the reforms. A demonstration project provides the perfect vehicle to prove that increased self-disclosure protocols for the Stark Law can decrease the government's costs of enforcement, improve program integrity, and encourage providers to deal responsibly with the inevitable minor lapses in compliance that arise in such an enormous government program as Medicare."

Design/methodology/approach-The paper takes the form of a narrative review. Findings-During the same period that a downturn in its economy increased the number of uninsured and under-insured Americans, falling government revenues led to decreases in Medicaid coverage and a shift from administration by non-profit government to for-profit health maintenance organization entities. Hospitals in the USA scored as better managed than those of other countries in one study, but wide variation in local health service performance between and within its states also has been documented, and too many American families are foregoing needed care because of insurance and affordability problems. Whether shifting a public safety net healthcare system from public to private administration will make the situation better or worse has become the subject of political debate and court cases. Originality/value-Perhaps masked by political party rhetoric focusing news attention on the future of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (""ObamaCare""), America's public Medicaid system is increasingly being given over to control by private sector health maintenance organizations.

A second is the cut-throat zero-sum politics of interest-group conflict, as evident in the intense competition among stakeholders for limited resources and authority.

Then five justices, led by Chief Justice John Roberts, prevented the outright elimination of the expansion by fashioning a remedy that simply limited the federal government's enforcement powers over its provisions and allowed states not to proceed with expanding Medicaid without losing all of their federal Medicaid funding. The Court's approach raises two fundamental issues: First, does the Court's holding also affect the existing Medicaid program or numerous other Affordable Care Act Medicaid amendments establishing minimum Medicaid program requirements? And second, does the health and human services secretary have the flexibility to modify the pace or scope of the expansion as a negotiating strategy with the states?

Purpose: To compare FQHC and look-alike physician performance with private practice primary care physicians (PCPs) on ambulatory care quality measures. Methods: The study was a cross-sectional analysis of visits in the 2006-2008 National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey. Performance of FQHCs and look-alikes on 18 quality measures was compared with private practice PCPs. Data analysis was completed in 2011. Results: Compared to private practice PCPs, FQHCs and look-alikes performed better on six measures (p<0.05); worse on diet counseling in at-risk adolescents (26% vs 36%, p=0.05); and no differently on 11 measures. Higher performance occurred in ACE inhibitors use for congestive heart failure (51% vs 37%, p=0.004); aspirin use in coronary artery disease (CAD; 57% vs 44%, p=0.004); β-blocker use for CAD (59% vs 47%, p=0.01); no use of benzodiazepines in depression (91% vs 84%, p=0.008); blood pressure screening (90% vs 86%, p<0.001); and screening electrocardiogram (EKG) avoidance in low-risk patients (99% vs 93%, p<0.001). Adjusting for patient characteristics yielded similar results, except that private practice PCPs no longer performed better on any measures. Conclusions: FQHCs and look-alikes demonstrated equal or better performance than private practice PCPs on select quality measures despite serving patients who have more chronic disease and socioeconomic complexity. These findings can provide policymakers with some reassurance as to the quality of chronic disease and preventive care at Federally Qualified Health Centers and look-alikes, as they plan to use these health centers to serve 20 million newly insured individuals. © 2012 American Journal of Preventive Medicine."

These systems may be of particular benefit to patients who face barriers to accessing care or have multiple health conditions. But it remains to be seen how safety-net providers, including community health centers and public hospitals--which have long experience in caring for these vulnerable populations--will be included in integrated delivery systems. This issue brief explores key considerations for incorporating safety-net providers into integrated delivery systems and discusses the roles of state and federal agencies in sup-porting and testing models of integrated care delivery. The authors conclude that the most important principles in creating integrated delivery systems for vulnerable populations are: (1) an emphasis on primary care; (2) coordination of all care, including behavioral, social, and public health services; and (3) accountability for population health outcomes."

We examined the health care access, quality, and cost experienced by insured Latina mothers in two communities, Minneapolis, Minnesota and McAllen, Texas. These communities differ substantially by the size of the local population without health insurance coverage. Four focus groups were conducted with insured Latina mothers who were caring for at least one child in their household. Eleven and thirteen mothers participated in each community, respectively. The experiences of the insured population in McAllen were substantially different from the experiences of the insured population in Minneapolis. The perceptions of health care quality and access by insured Latina mothers were substantially lower in McAllen while out-of-pocket costs were perceived to be higher in Minneapolis. Our study provides key insights about the US health care system and the role that the relative size of the local uninsured population may have in impacting the health care experiences of the insured. Health insurance coverage rates are expected to increase substantially across US communities within the next few years but local health care system challenges related to cost, quality, and access will remain for both the insured and the uninsured. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011."

Berwick argues that the solution to Medicare's cost-containment challenge lies in quality improvement. He is optimistic that accountable care organizations can deliver savings and suggests that shifting risk downstream to providers throws the health insurance model into question.

Bush's Conscience Rule, this attack is never so evident. The culture of secular relativism increasingly is becoming hostile toward conscience rights and religion, especially the Roman Catholic Church, which is the largest nongovernmental provider of health care in this country. Our Holy Father, Pope Benedict XVI, in his recent visit to Westminster Hall of the United Kingdom addressed the ""proper place of religious belief in the political process."" He stated, ""These are worrying signs of a failure to appreciate not only the rights of believers to freedom of conscience and freedom of religion, but also the legitimate role of religion in the public square.""1 This presentation provides an overview of the threats to conscience faced by health-care professionals, particularly with a focus on the myriad of attacks at the state level, as they are potentiated by both the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the revised Conscience Rule. Health-care professionals increasingly find that, when attempting to exercise their First Amendment rights to the free exercise of religion in health care, they are accused of violating the principle of the separation of church and state.

Both factors may accelerate the development of one viable model to streamline care, integrated delivery systems-coordinated care networks that deliver all needed health services to a defined population. Through interviews and surveys, we examined ten California counties that participated in two federally and locally funded initiatives to redesign how care is delivered to predominantly poor and uninsured populations. We found substantial progress in assessing and managing access to specialists, monitoring and promoting quality, and offering disease management and care coordination training in a majority of counties. However, efforts to coordinate care, electronically disseminate patient information, and align financial incentives were less successful or more difficult to assess. We posit that integrated delivery systems could improve care efficiency and quality and make countywide safety-net systems a desirable source of care for newly insured patients under health reform. © 2012 Project HOPE-The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc."

They were financially healthy primarily because they obtained subsidies from state and local governments, such as property tax transfers or supplemental Medicaid payments, including disproportionate share payments. However, safety-net hospitals now face a new market reality. The economic downturn, slow recovery, and politics of deficit reduction have eroded the ability of local governments to support the safety net. Many safety-net hospitals have not focused on effective management, cost control, quality improvement, or services that attract insured patients. As a result, and coupled with new uncertainties regarding Medicaid expansion stemming from the recent Supreme Court decision on the Affordable Care Act, many are likely to face increasing financial and competitive pressures that may threaten their survival. © 2012 by Project HOPE - The People-to-People Health Foundation."

This article provides evidence that people with employer-sponsored coverage were more likely than Medicare beneficiaries to forgo needed care, experience access problems due to cost, encounter medical bill problems, and be less satisfied with their coverage. Within the subset of beneficiaries who are age sixty-five or older, those enrolled in the private Medicare Advantage program were less likely than those in traditional Medicare to have premiums and out-of-pocket costs exceed 10 percent of their income. But they were also more likely than those in traditional Medicare to rate their insurance poorly and to report cost-related access problems. These results suggest that policy options to shift Medicare beneficiaries into private insurance would need to be attentive to potentially negative insurance experiences, problems obtaining needed care, and difficulties paying medical bills. © 2012 by Project HOPE."

Increased postmarket research on the safety and comparative effectiveness of products would improve medical decisionmaking and lead to better clinical outcomes. Fortunately, Congress has recognized the value of this information for healthcare professionals. In response to a congressional mandate in the FDA Amendments Act (FDAAA), FDA is developing the Sentinel Initiative, an active surveillance system for monitoring postmarket drug safety issues. FDAAA also authorized FDA to require a drug sponsor to conduct postmarket safety studies or clinical trials to address a specific safety concern. To increase the repository of comparative effectiveness information, Congress established the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), directing it to manage comparative effectiveness research (CER). This article discusses the need for better safety and comparative effectiveness information and outlines methods to efficiently conduct the research and communicate it effectively to healthcare professionals. Coordination between FDA and the PCORI in gathering and communicating postmarket information is recommended. Medical source data collected by the Sentinel Initiative should be used for CER in addition to postmarket safety surveillance, and FDA and the PCORI should adopt identical standards for the distribution and communication of CER. Coordination between the two entities is recommended to save costs, reduce duplication of efforts, and to generate and communicate more information on prescription drugs for medical decisionmakers."

The Affordable Care Act (ACA) has been regarded as the most significant piece of domestic policy legislation since the establishment of Medicare in 1965. The ACA would cover an estimated 32 of the 50 million uninsured Americans by expanding Medicaid, providing subsidies to lower income individuals, establishing health insurance exchanges, and restricting insurance companies from excluding patients from coverage. The ACA also includes many payment and health care delivery system reforms intended to improve quality of care and control health care spending. Soon after passage of the ACA, numerous states and interest groups filed suits challenging its legality. Supreme Court consideration was requested in five cases and the Supreme Court selected one case, brought by 26 states, for review. Oral arguments were heard this spring, March 26-28. The decision will have far reaching consequences for health care in America and the practice of gastroenterology for decades to come. This article reviews the four major issues before the Supreme Court and implications for health care reform and future practice of gastroenterology. Payment reforms, increased accountability, significant pressures for cost control, and new care delivery models will significantly change the future practice of gastroenterology.

However, childhood cancer survivors may face barriers in accessing medical services due to being uninsured or underinsured. Little is known about the quality of survivors' health insurance coverage, and improving health insurance within the context of changes mandated by the 2010 Affordable Care Act requires understanding survivors' coverage. The current study explored adult childhood cancer survivors' quality of health insurance coverage. Methods: From 9/09 to 2/10, we conducted in-depth, semistructured qualitative interviews with 39 adult participants from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study, a cohort of 5-year survivors of cancers diagnosed before age 21. Interviews were recorded and transcribed; content analyses were conducted by two coders (kappa = 0. 88) using NVivo 8. Results: Most insured survivors reported satisfaction with the quality of their coverage; however, they expressed low expectations. Almost half reported annual out-of-pocket costs exceeding $2,000, yet most felt fortunate to simply have coverage. One third of insured survivors had difficulty obtaining coverage, and many had difficulties understanding how to utilize it. Most uninsured survivors minimized their need for care. Worry about future health care costs seemed inevitable among insured and uninsured survivors. Almost all participants lacked knowledge about existing health insurance-related laws. Conclusions and implications for cancer survivors: Insured survivors had low coverage expectations, and uninsured survivors avoided care. Childhood cancer survivors will likely benefit from assistance in how to access and utilize the new health care reform provisions (e. g., Medicaid expansion, expansion of parents' insurance, and mandatory primary care coverage). © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC."

This brief outlines differences that stand out in the states' initial approaches: the numbers and types of people initially appointed to the boards governing the exchanges; the role of the board relative to the state legislature; how the exchanges interact with existing insurance markets; and the involvement of stakeholders in each state. The decisions made by these states provide information that will be useful for other states implementing their exchanges. Going forward, these states will face a more challenging set of decisions, including how to finance the exchanges, how to make risk-adjusted payments to insurers for people likely to have high medical expenses, and how to avoid gaps in coverage and care for people who may have changes in income."

But determining the correct level of these subsidies will not be easy, because of several factors. These include the way in which eligibility will be calculated for participation in Medicaid or for subsidies through the exchanges; possibly inaccurate income projections; the use of different income time periods to determine eligibility; and fluctuations in income. I performed a simulation that shows that under the most likely methods to be used to determine eligibility for Medicaid or for receiving subsidies through exchanges, one-third of people with incomes initially judged to be below the Medicaid threshold would actually ""churn"" into an exchange at the end of the year. Other people would be wrongly deemed ineligible for advance subsidy payments because their projected income was too high, while still others judged eligible for subsidies would receive advance payments on those subsidies that were too high by $208 per year, on average. To reduce these errors, I recommend the adoption of a single eligibility standard based on income data derived from prior tax returns, along with generous accommodations during a given enrollment year for people who claim a change in circumstances, such as a change in income. © 2012 Project HOPE-The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc."

Political researchers and pundits have speculated endlessly on the many changes mandated by the 2010 national health care reform legislation, styled the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. A review and assessment of this legislation at several levels (federal, state, state agency, local region, and individual business leaders) were undertaken. The results of this expanded analysis suggest strongly that nationally members of the business community and their employees will benefit from the legislation early on (years 1 through 3) and then likely will be impacted adversely as the payment mechanisms driving the legislation are tightened by new federal regulations (years 4 onward). As a result of this research, it is surmised that businesses will be immediately impacted by the legislation, with small business owners being the prime beneficiaries of the new legislation, owing to the availability of coverage to approximately 32 million individuals who previously had no access to coverage. In that regard, the soon-to-be newly insured population also will be a prime beneficiary of the legislation as the limitations on chronic illnesses and other preexisting conditions will be reduced or eliminated by the legislation.

The potential financial impact has not been thoroughly examined. We characterized the health risk of uninsured adults in Buncombe County, North Carolina, relative to that of local Medicaid recipients, to estimate the cost of expanding Medicaid coverage to include the uninsured. We obtained de-identified patient enrollment and claims data for 2008 from the Division of Medical Assistance, North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services and from the 3 safety-net providers who care for most of the county's low-income uninsured adults. We used the Chronic Illness and Disability Payment System (CDPS) risk-adjustment tool to measure the relative health risk of the two populations. Based on actual spending in the Medicaid group and its health risk relative to that of the uninsured, we then projected how much it would have cost to provide Medicaid coverage for these uninsured in 2008. We estimated, based on CDPS adjustment for demographics and diagnoses, that these uninsured adults would have incurred costs 13% greater than those of the actual nondisabled adult Medicaid population. The projected cost of providing Medicaid coverage to these uninsured would have been $4,320 per person. Data were drawn from only the 3 major safety-net organizations and therefore excluded care obtained from other safety-net providers. Also, this sample of uninsured people included some who are ineligible for Medicaid because of their citizenship status. Furthermore, Medicaid enrollment might lead to increased utilization, revealing a greater burden of illness than we detected. In Buncombe County, uninsured adults who enroll in expanded Medicaid are likely to have somewhat more costly health problems than do currently enrolled nondisabled adults."

Studies evaluating the effect of PCM on birth outcomes have shown little or no positive results. One suggested reason for these findings is a lack of attention in the assessment of dosage. The objective of this study is to demonstrate the use of measuring PCM dosage when assessing pregnancy outcomes. A birth cohort (N = 4,582) encompassing Medicaidinsured Iowa residents enrolled in PCM who gave birth to a singleton from October 2005 to December 2006 was constructed from linked Iowa birth, Medicaid Claims, and Women's Health Information Systems datasets. Data was used to create a dosage measure capturing the duration of enrollment, amount of time spent with a case manager, and breadth of interventions. Bivariate analysis and logistic regression were used to assess the relationship between PCM dosage and the birth outcomes. Dosage was significantly associated with LBW (χ 2 = 31.1, P &lt; 0.001) and PTB (χ 2 = 56.2, P &lt; 0.001). After adjustment for potential confounders, the likelihood of LBW and PTB were aOR: 0.47 (95% CI: 0.36-0.63) and aOR: 0.60 (95% CI: 0.44-0.82) for women with medium dosage (compared to low dosage), respectively. For women with high PCM dosage the likelihood of LBW and PTB was aOR 0.40 (95% CI: 0.31-0.51) and aOR = 0.62 (95% CI: 0.48-0.81), respectively.

While Massachusetts passed healthcare reform in 2007 with many similar provisions, it is unknown whether the disparities were present during the period of the law's enactment. Questions/purposes We asked whether differences in rates of surgery between patients with novel governmentsubsidized healthcare plans and other forms of insurance, and between uninsured and insured patients, were similar after institution of the Massachusetts reform laws. Methods Weidentified 7577 patients diagnosed with upper extremity injuries between January 1, 2007 and October 1, 2010. From an institutional administrative database, we extracted demographics, insurance status, and plan of care. Insurance categories included government-subsidized healthcare plan (Commonwealth Care), private insurance, workers compensation, military-related (TriCare), Medicare, Medicaid (MassHealth), non-Commonwealth Care, and other insured and uninsured. After adjusting for age, gender, and diagnosis, we compared the proportions of patients who underwent elective surgery. Results Of 7577 patients, 1685 (22%) underwent elective upper extremity surgery. The adjusted rates of surgery were similar across most insurance categories, with higher rates in the workers compensation and TriCare categories compared with Commonwealth Care. Uninsured patients were as likely to undergo surgery as insured patients. Conclusion In a population with near-universal health insurance, a government-run health insurance exchange, and novel, government-subsidized, managed care plans, we found few insurance-based differences in rates of elective upper extremity orthopaedic surgery in a cohort of patients after healthcare reform. © The Association of Bone and Joint Surgeons® 2012."

Because self-insurance arrangements may offer advantages--such as lower costs, exemption from most state insurance regulation and greater flexibility in benefit design--they are especially attractive to large firms with enough employees to spread risk adequately to avoid the financial fallout from potentially catastrophic medical costs of some employees. Recently, with rising health care costs and changing market dynamics, more small firms--100 or fewer workers--are interested in self-insuring health benefits, according to a new qualitative study from the Center for Studying Health System Change (HSC). Self-insured firms typically use a third-party administrator (TPA) to process medical claims and provide access to provider networks. Firms also often purchase stop-loss insurance to cover medical costs exceeding a predefined amount. Increasingly competitive markets for TPA services and stop-loss insurance are making self-insurance attractive to more employers. The 2010 national health reform law imposes new requirements and taxes on health insurance that may spur more small firms to consider self-insurance. In turn, if more small firms opt to self-insure, certain health reform goals, such as strengthening consumer protections and making the small-group health insurance market more viable, may be undermined. Specifically, adverse selection--attracting sicker-than-average people--is a potential issue for the insurance exchanges created by reform."

Thus, standard information about patient substance use will have to be collected and used by providers within electronic health record systems (EHRS). Although there are many important technical, legal, and patient confidentiality issues that must be dealt with to achieve integration, this article focuses upon efforts by the National Institute on Drug Abuse and other federal agencies to develop a common set of core questions to screen, diagnose, and initiate treatment for substance use disorders as part of national EHRS.

Since they constitute around 75 per cent of the world's population, it is a matter of great concern for the future of healthcare itself, if for the majority of world's population, access to medicines, which are patent protected, is denied. Problems of access to medicines are related to the problems of non-availability of disposable income among the population to meet their medical needs as well as the high and unaffordable prices of drugs. The issue that is now being debated is the impact of the TRIPS Agreement on the availability and affordability of much needed medicines for the poorer populations of the world and if there is indeed a negative impact, what are the possible modalities to reduce that impact and make drugs cheaper for deserving populations and developing countries? Between the flexibilities available in TRIPS Agreement and the Doha Declaration on Public Health, can Member Countries through appropriate legislative and administrative measures, safeguard the interests of their poor populations? Can governments in developing countries bring in appropriate legislations to ensure equitable access to medicines much like the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of Barack Obama approved by the US Congress in March 2010?"

The 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act mandated elimination of copayments for CRC screening, including colonoscopy, but little is known about the effects of copayment elimination on use. The University of Texas employee, retiree, and dependent health plan instituted and promoted a waiver of copayments for screening colonoscopies in fiscal year (FY) 2009; we examined the effects of removing cost sharing on colonoscopy use. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 59,855 beneficiaries of the University of Texas employee, retiree, and dependent health plan, associated with 16 University of Texas health and nonhealth campuses, ages 50-64 years at any point in FYs 2002-2009 (267,191 person-years of follow-up evaluation). The primary outcome was colonoscopy incidence among individuals with no prior colonoscopy. We compared the age- and sex-standardized incidence ratios for colonoscopy in FY 2009 (after the copayment waiver) with the expected incidence for FY 2009, based on secular trends from years before the waiver. Results: The annual incidence of colonoscopy increased to 9.5% after the copayment was waived, compared with an expected incidence of 8.0% (standardized incidence ratio, 1.18; 95% confidence interval, 1.14-1.23; P < .001). After adjusting for age, sex, and beneficiary status, the copayment waiver remained significantly associated with greater use of colonoscopy, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.19 (95% confidence interval, 1.12-1.26). Conclusions: Waiving copayments for colonoscopy screening results in a statistically significant, but modest (1.5%), increase in use. Additional strategies beyond removing financial disincentives are needed to increase use of CRC screening. © 2012 AGA Institute."

The authors examined how two mechanisms in the Affordable Care Act (ACA), namely, risk adjustment and reinsurance, might perform to ensure the financial solvency of health plans that have a disproportionate share of enrollees with mental health conditions. Risk adjustment is an ACA provision requiring that a federal or state exchange move funds from insurance plans with healthier enrollees to plans with sicker enrollees. Reinsurance is a provision in which all plans in the state contribute to an overall pool of money that is used to reimburse costs to individual market plans for expenditures of any individual enrollee that exceed a high predetermined level. Method: Using 2006-2007 claims data from a sample of private and public health plans, the authors compared expected health plan compensation under diagnosis-based risk adjustment with actual health care expenditures, under different assumptions for chronic mental health and medical conditions. Analyses were conducted with and without the addition of $100,000 reinsurance. Results: Risk adjustment performed well for most plans. For some plans with a high share of enrollees with mental health conditions, underpayment was substantial enough to raise concern. Reinsurance appeared to be helpful in addressing the most serious underpayment problems remaining after risk adjustment. Risk adjustment performed similarly for health plan cohorts that had a disproportionate share of enrollees with chronic mental health and medical conditions. Conclusions: Cost models indicate that the regulatory provisions in the ACA requiring risk adjustment and reinsurance can help protect health plans covering treatment for mentally ill individuals against risk selection. This model analysis may be useful for advocates for individuals with mental illness in considering their own state's insurance exchange."

The NP workforce has been growing rapidly in recent years, but fluctuation in enrollments in the past decades has resulted in a wide range of forecasts. Objectives: To forecast the future NP workforce using a novel method that has been applied to the registered nurse and physician workforces and is robust to fluctuating enrollment trends. Research Design: An age-cohort regression-based model was applied to the current and historical workforce, which was then forecasted to future years assuming stable age effects and a continuation of recent cohort trends. Subjects: A total of 6798 NPs who were identified as having completed NP training in the National Sample Survey of Registered Nurses between 1992 and 2008. Results: The future workforce is projected to grow to 244,000 in 2025, an increase of 94% from 128,000 in 2008. If NPs are defined more restrictively as those who self-identify their position title as ""NP,"" supply is projected to grow from 86,000 to 198,000 (130%) over this period. Conclusions: The large projected increase in NP supply is higher and more grounded than other forecasts and has several implications: NPs will likely fulfill a substantial amount of future demand for care. Furthermore, as the ratio of NPs to Nurse Practitioners to physicians will surely grow, there could be implications for quality of care and for the configuration of future care delivery systems. © 2012 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins."

Whether most or few doctors' offices are accessible is not known. We address this gap with data on 2389 primary care provider facilities. Objectives: The analysis seeks to describe overall primary care office physical accessibility and identify (1) in which areas offices meet access criteria, (2) which accessibility criteria are most often not met, and (3) whether there are urban/non-urban differences. Methods: Reviewers rated medical offices using a 55-item instrument that assessed parking, exterior access, building entrance, interior public spaces, doctor's office interior, and the presence of accessible exam equipment. Five health plans that serve California Medicaid patients conducted reviews of providers signed with their plans. Data from the plans were merged, coded, and a descriptive analysis conducted. Results: An accessible weight scale was present in 3.6% and a height adjustable examination table in 8.4% of the sites. Other high prevalence access barriers were in bathrooms and examination rooms. Parking, exterior access, building access, and interior public spaces generally met the access criteria, except for van accessible parking. Conclusions: These findings provide a base for quantitative expectations about accessibility nationwide, and indicate significant barriers exist. They show it is possible to conduct a large number of accessibility site reviews, providing one model to meet the Affordable Care Act requirement for provider accessibility information.

Therefore, there is an urgent need to create more primary-care physicians and to train physicians to practice in this environment. In this article, we review the impact that the changing US healthcare system has on trainees, strategies to recruit and retain medical students and residents into primary-care internal medicine, and the preparation of trainees to work in the changing healthcare system. Recruitment methods for medical students include early preclinical exposure to patients in the primary-care setting, enhanced longitudinal patient experiences in clinical clerkships, and primary-care tracks. Recruitment methods for residents include enhanced ambulatory-care training and primary-care programs. Financial-incentive programs such as loan forgiveness may encourage trainees to enter primary care. Retaining residents in primary-care careers may be encouraged via focused postgraduate fellowships or continuing medical education to prepare primary-care physicians as both teachers and practitioners in the changing environment. Finally, to prepare primary-care trainees to effectively and efficiently practice within the changing system, educators should consider shifting ambulatory training to community-based practices, encouraging resident participation in team-based care, providing interprofessional educational experiences, and involving trainees in quality-improvement initiatives.

Over the past 40 years, the growth of SBHCs evolved from various public health needs to the development of a specific collaborative model of care that is sensitive to the unique needs of children and youth, as well as to vulnerable populations facing significant barriers to access. The SBHC model of health care comprises of on-school site health care delivery by an interdisciplinary team of health professionals, which can include primary care and mental health clinicians. Research has demonstrated the SBHCs' impacts on delivering preventive care, such as immunizations; managing chronic illnesses, such as asthma, obesity, and mental health conditions; providing reproductive health services for adolescents; and even improving youths' academic performance. Although evaluation of the SBHC model of care has been complicated, results have thus far demonstrated increased access to care, improved health and education outcomes, and high levels of satisfaction. Despite their proven success, SBHCs have consistently faced challenges in securing adequate funding for operations and developing effective financial systems for billing and reimbursement. Implementation of health care reform (The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act [P.L. 111-148]) will profoundly affect the health care access and outcomes of children and youth, particularly vulnerable populations. The inclusion of funding for SBHCs in this legislation is momentous, as there continues to be increased demand and limited funding for affordable services. To better understand how this model of care has and could further help promote the health of our nation's youth, a review is presented of the history and growth of SBHCs and the literature demonstrating their impacts. It may not be feasible for SBHCs to be established in every school campus in the country. However, the lessons learned from the synergy of the health and school settings have major implications for the delivery of care for all providers concerned with improving the health and well-being of children and adolescents. © 2012 Mosby, Inc."

With passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 as amended by the Heathcare and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, which expands health insurance coverage for the United States population and increases access to preventive services, there are new opportunities to promote and improve use of these valuable and life-saving services.

This supplement highlighted that the use of the clinical preventive services in the U.S. adult population is not optimal and is quite variable, ranging from approximately 10% to 85%, depending on the particular service. Use was particularly low for tobacco cessation, aspirin use to reduce risk of cardiovascular disease, and influenza vaccination; however, ample opportunity exists to improve use of all of these services. Among the specific populations least likely to have used the recommended services, persons with no insurance, no usual source of care, or no recent use of the health-care system (if included in the analysis) were the groups least likely to have used the services. Use among the uninsured was generally 10 to 30 percentage points below the general population averages, suggesting that improvements in insurance coverage are likely to increase use of these clinical preventive services. A randomized, controlled trial of an expansion of Medicaid coverage by Oregon in 2008 supports this hypothesis by demonstrating improved use of clinical services with increased health insurance coverage. A recent survey among the uninsured found a low level of awareness of the provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 as amended by the Healthcare and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (referred to collectively as the Affordable Care Act [ACA]). Therefore, improving opportunities for coverage might be insufficient, and focused efforts by governmental health agencies and other stakeholders are likely to be needed to enroll uninsured persons in health plans. In addition, although use of the preventive services in insured populations was greater than among the uninsured, use among the insured was generally <75%, and often much less. Therefore, having health insurance coverage might not itself be sufficient to optimize use of clinical preventive services, and additional measures to improve use are likely to be necessary."

Of those living with HIV at the end of 2008, nearly two thirds were racial/ethnic minorities and half were men who have sex with men (MSM). In 2007, HIV ranked fifth as a leading cause of death among persons aged 35-44 years in the United States but third among blacks or African Americans in this age group. In 40 states with longstanding confidential name-based HIV surveillance systems, 33% of the estimated 41,768 adults and adolescents diagnosed with HIV infection in 2008 developed acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) within 1 year and, of these, 44% received their initial diagnosis in an acute care setting, suggesting that they received HIV testing late in the course of the infection. HIV-infected persons who are unaware of their infection or who receive a late diagnosis cannot benefit fully from timely initiation of therapy and are more likely to experience HIV-related morbidity and premature mortality. In addition, persons unaware of their infection are more likely to transmit HIV to others because of a higher prevalence of high-risk sexual behaviors and higher levels of viral RNA that continue to replicate without appropriate antiretroviral treatment."

Although not intended to be specific to cancer, the act's implementation will profoundly impact cancer care. Its components will influence multiple levels of the health-care environment including states, communities, health-care organizations, and individuals seeking care. To illustrate these influences, two reforms are considered: 1) accountable care organizations and 2) insurance-based reforms to gather evidence about effectiveness. We discuss these reforms using three facets of multilevel interventions: 1) their intended and unintended consequences, 2) the importance of timing, and 3) their implications for cancer. The success of complex health reforms requires understanding the scientific basis and evidence for carrying out such multilevel interventions. Conversely and equally important, successful implementation of multilevel interventions depends on understanding the political setting and goals of health-care reform. © The Author 2012.

There is, therefore, a need to consider our approach to health-care delivery. Cancer care is a good example for consideration because it spans the continuum of health-care issues from primary prevention through long-term survival and end-of-life care. In this monograph, we emphasize that health-care delivery occurs in a multilevel system that includes organizations, teams, and individuals. To achieve health-care delivery consistent with the Institute of Medicine's six quality aims (safety, effectiveness, timeliness, efficiency, patient-centeredness, and equity), we must influence multiple levels of that multilevel system. The notion that multiple levels of contextual influence affect behaviors through interdependent interactions is a well-established ecological view. This view has been used to analyze health-care delivery and health disparities. However, experience considering multilevel interventions in health care is much less robust. This monograph includes 13 chapters relevant to expanding the foundation of research for multilevel interventions in health-care delivery. Subjects include clinical cases of multilevel thinking in health-care delivery, the state of knowledge regarding multilevel interventions, study design and measurement considerations, methods for combining interventions, time as a consideration in the evaluation of effects, measurement of effects, simulations, application of multilevel thinking to health-care systems and disparities, and implementation of the Affordable Care Act of 2010. Our goal is to outline an agenda to proceed with multilevel intervention research, not because it guarantees improvement in our current approach to health care, but because ignoring the complexity of the multilevel environment in which care occurs has not achieved the desired improvements in care quality outlined by the Institute of Medicine at the turn of the millennium. © The Author 2012.

Additionally, recent court rulings on the PPACA were analyzed to assess the law's chances of successful implementation. The PPACA contains a variety of reforms that, if implemented, will significantly impact the field of PM&R. Many PPACA reforms change how rehabilitative care is delivered by integrating different levels of care and creating uniform quality metrics to assess quality and efficiency. These quality metrics will ultimately be tied to new, performance-based payment systems. While the law contains ambitious initiatives that may, if unsuccessful or incorrectly implemented, negatively impact PM&R, it also has the potential to greatly improve the quality and efficiency of rehabilitative care.

As unemployment increased so did the uninsured. Already operating on a slim margin and poor payer mix, many critical access hospitals are facing a tough road ahead. Purpose: We seek to examine the increasing impact of uncompensated care on the revenues earned by Washington's critical access hospitals; to forecast uncompensated care to the year 2014; and to forecast the financial impact on rural hospital uncompensated care of HR 3590, the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Findings: For critical access hospitals in the state of Washington, total uncompensated care increased by almost $16 million, a 22% increase from 2008 to 2009. By 2014, total uncompensated care is forecast to more than double from 2009, totaling $174 million annually without health reforms. Using the Urban Institute's Health Insurance Policy Simulation Model, uncompensated care is forecast to fall by $106 million in 2014, thereby reducing the uncompensated care percentage from 5.31% to 2.07%. Conclusions: Policy makers and health care managers should note that a substantial portion of the newly insured from the ACA will most likely be Medicaid participants. Given this source of lower revenue per case, critical access hospital administrators should seek additional public and private sources of revenue. Most importantly, rural hospital managers must maintain or improve their cost efficiency, while serving the needs of their rural population as we move closer toward the implementation of health reforms. © 2011 National Rural Health Association."

Then it simulated the impact of full implementation of provisions of the Affordable Care Act on adults who currently have individual insurance, including important subgroups-adults with chronic conditions, the near-elderly (ages 55-64), and low-income populations. If adults who had individual insurance during 2001-08 had instead had benefits similar to those under the Affordable Care Act, their average annual out-of-pocket spending on medical care and drugs might have been $280 less.

Some states may apply these standards to all health insurance sold within the state. More than half of Americans who had individual insurance in 2010 were enrolled in plans that would not qualify as providing essential coverage under the rules of the exchanges in 2014.

The Basic Health Program is intended, in part, to decrease churning, or frequent movement between Medicaid and state-run health insurance exchanges, by increasing the income-based eligibility transition point between the two programs to 200 percent of the federal poverty level. We analyzed data from the 2008 panel of the Survey of Income and Program Participation and found that among adults likely to participate in Medicaid and exchanges, only somewhat fewer experienced a change in eligibility with a 200 percent federal poverty level eligibility threshold compared with the previous threshold of 138 percent. As a result, we found that a Basic Health Program would prevent churning for 1.8 million adults nationally each year-reducing by about 4 percent the expected churning of low-income Americans between Medicaid and exchanges within a year. Such programs would also decrease the risk that lower-income families would be subject to recouping of premium tax credits.

It shows that distributed approaches function as well as or better than centralized ones-where insurers submit raw claims data to the risk adjustment authority-in terms of the goals of risk adjustment. In particular, it shows how distributed data analysis can be used to calibrate risk adjustment models and calculate payments, both in theory and in practice-drawing on the experience of distributed models in other contexts.

Previous cost difference estimates, which show a spike around the time of cessation, suggest premiums might rise as a result of covering these services. Purpose: The goal of the study was to test (1) whether individuals in an RCT of pharmacotherapy and counseling for smoking cessation differed in their healthcare costs around the cessation period, and (2) whether the healthcare costs of those in the trial who successfully quit were different from a matched sample of smokers in the community. Methods: Generalized linear regression models were used to analyze healthcare cost data on individuals enrolled in a comparative effectiveness trial of cessation therapies between October 2005 and May 2007 (1346 total participants; 1338 with requisite data for further analysis). Cost differences for the period preceding and subsequent to the cessation attempt were assessed by trial participants' 12-month sustained quit status. Healthcare cost differences between sustained quitters and a sample of community-dwelling smokers, matched to these quitters on the basis of health services use around the time trial participant enrolled and by demographics, were also examined. Data were analyzed in 2011. Results: All three groups had a spike in cost associated with the index clinic visit. Regression results revealed little difference in healthcare costs by quit status for trial participants until the sixth quarter post-quit. By that quarter, continuous sustained quitters cost $541 (p<0.001) less than continuing smokers. Continuous sustained quitters cost less than their matched community- dwelling smokers in almost every quarter observed. The cost difference ranged from $270 (p=0.01) during the quarter of quit, to $490 (p<0.01) in the 6th quarter after quitting.

Data Sources Private sector employer data from the 2000, 2001, and 2008 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey-Insurance Component (MEPS-IC). Study Design We examine time trends in employer offer, eligibility, and take-up rates. We add a new dimension to the literature by examining dependent coverage and decomposing its trends. We investigate heterogeneity in trends by firm size. Data Collection The MEPS-IC is an annual survey, sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau. The MEPS-IC obtains information on establishment characteristics, whether an establishment offers health insurance, and details on up to four plans. Principal Findings We find that coverage rates for workers declined in both small and large firms. In small firms, coverage declined due to a drop in both offer and take-up rates. In the largest firms, offer rates were stable and the decline was due to falling take-up rates. In addition, enrollment shifted toward single coverage and away from dependent coverage in both small and large firms. For small firms, this shift was due to declining offer and take-up rates for dependent coverage. In large firms, offers of dependent coverage were stable but take-up rates dropped. Within the category of dependent coverage, the availability of employee-plus-one plans increased in all firm size categories, but take-up rates for these plans declined in small firms. © Health Research and Educational Trust."

To define the current use of CER in the development of new drugs and technologies and explore what is needed for this research approach to reduce or stabilize health care costs in the United States. In 2010, the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) was established by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) to coordinate federally funded CER and recommend research priorities. Hochman and McCormick's (2010) evaluation of 328 randomized trials, observational studies, and meta-analyses involving medications published between June 2008 and September 2009 in 6 key journals showed that most published research did not fulfill the criteria of CER (defined as comparison to active treatment) and that most study design is driven by FDA requirements rather than the need to develop evidence to facilitates election of the most effective therapy. Since PPACA provides alternative funding for CER, it could encourage funding more studies to help determine which treatment delivers the best value per unit of investment from clinical, humanistic, and economic perspectives. Manufacturers may avoid CER because it increases product development costs, but a drug proven more effective is more likely to be accepted by formulary committees, increasing the drug's market share, whereas payers may reject or limit use of a new drug that performs less effectively in comparative studies. CER may not directly reduce expenditures for drugs and medical technologies. The results may vary widely from case to case; however, despite often significantly higher prices for new drugs, it is important to look beyond product costs to the overall impact on health care costs, including medical cost offsets that may occur through improved health or decreased morbidity. To truly decrease cost and improve quality, cost-effectiveness will have to be integrated into CER with the objective of prioritizing efficient therapies in the real-world health care system. If the methods and output of CER improve, the resulting cost-effectiveness ratios will also be more useful to the payer. CER should ultimately, therefore, be a useful tool to help patients, providers, and decision makers provide the most effective and most cost-effective interventions."

Primary Data Source National Health Interview Survey (1997-2009). Study Design We use the Children's Health Insurance Program, enacted in 1997, as a natural experiment, and we performed a panel data regression analysis using the state-year as the unit of observation. Outcomes include physician visits per child per year and the following indicators of access to primary care: whether the child saw a physician, pediatrician, or visited an ER in the last year, and whether the parents reported experiencing a non-cost-related access problem. We analyzed these outcomes among all children, and separately among socioeconomic status (SES) quartiles defined based on family income and parents' education. Principal Findings Children's Health Insurance Program had a major impact on the extent and nature of children's insurance coverage. However, it is not associated with any change in the aggregate quantity of physician services, and its associations with indicators of access are mixed. Increases in physician fees are associated with broad-based improvements in indicators of access. Conclusions The findings suggest that (1) coverage expansions, even if they substantially reduce patient cost sharing, do not necessarily increase physician utilization, and (2) increasing the generosity of provider payments in public programs can improve access among low-SES children, and, through spillover effects, increase higher-SES children as well. © Health Research and Educational Trust."

In Douglas v. Independent Living Center, the United States articulated a deferential stance toward the states, a position consistent with longstanding states' rights concerns in the Medicaid program. On the other hand, the federal government has advocated a very broad view of federal authority under the spending power to modify and expand Medicaid in Florida v. Health and Human Services. Congress has acted in ways that are contradictory regarding Medicaid throughout the program's history, and those conflicting attitudes have been accentuated by the executive branch's dissonant litigation strategies this term. This essay posits that the Court could minimize confusion with narrow holdings in both Douglas and Florida v. HHS so as to allow Congress and HHS latitude to resolve their conflicting attitudes toward Medicaid as well as the intricacies of conditional spending."

Reports of satisfaction levels vary across studies, but most evidence points toward comparable levels of satisfaction in Canada and the United States.

Over the last decade in particular, a number of states have transferred many functions that they once performed to private entities, including, in a number of cases, express policymaking functions. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) takes some crucial steps towards readjusting the equilibrium of Medicaid. Rather than further prioritizing the market in its reforms, it gives the federal government stronger charge of Medicaid policy, refocusing the program more directly on expanding eligibility and providing secure care for beneficiaries in the process. I argue that this reprioritization is in better keeping with the purpose of Medicaid, in contradistinction to the market-driven reforms undertaken during the Bush administration and sought by some states today. It does, however, shift more power from the states to the federal government. This has raised concerns not only from states that oppose the new health reform law, but also from a number that support it. These two groups of states share a desire for greater flexibility in their Medicaid programs than the ACA permits. Yet only one of these groups should be permitted to use federal Medicaid funds to make the reforms they seek. Federal administrations need to be particularly careful, when considering whether to grant state Medicaid waiver requests, to uphold Medicaid's purpose of giving lower-income Americans genuine access to the same health care that other Americans receive."

This paper's analysis of national survey estimates found that access to health care and use of health services for adults ages 19-64-the primary targets of the Affordable Care Act- deteriorated between 2000 and 2010, particularly among those who were uninsured. More than half of uninsured US adults did not see a doctor in 2010, and only slightly more than a quarter of these adults were seen by a dentist.

We used a microsimulation model to show that racial and ethnic differentials in coverage could be greatly reduced, potentially cutting the eight-percentage-point black-white differential in uninsurance rates by more than half and the nineteen-percentage-point Hispanic-white differential by just under one-quarter. However, blacks and Hispanics are still projected to remain more likely to be uninsured than whites. Achieving low uninsurance under the Affordable Care Act will depend on effective state policies to attain high enrollment in Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program and the new insurance exchanges. Coverage gains among Hispanics will probably depend on adoption of strategies that address language and related barriers to enrollment and retention in California and Texas, where almost half of Hispanics live.

In Germany, public insurers operate many such programs. Participation nearly doubled between 2004 and 2008, reaching one-quarter of the publicly insured population. An evaluation of one large wellness program there found that it reduced costs. However, population-level survey data also suggest that individuals with low incomes or poor health are less likely to enroll. In the United States, the Affordable Care Act raised the maximum allowed size of wellness incentives, which could lead to wide differences in insurance premiums between users and nonusers of programs, and may risk reintroducing a form of medical underwriting. The German experience confirms the cost-saving potential of programs, but also suggests that they should be evaluated rigorously to ensure they do not disadvantage those with health problems or low incomes."

Moreover, the gaps in health care between them and higher-income populations are significantly reduced. The Affordable Care Act includes numerous provisions that will significantly expand health insurance coverage, especially to low-income patients, as well as provisions to promote medical homes.

If an ACO succeeds in achieving both the quality measures and reduced costs, the ACO will share in Medicare's cost savings.

We discuss these challenges and the likely effect of recent federal legislation, including the Second Chance Act, the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act, and the Affordable Care Act. We estimated that with the implementation of health reform, up to 33.6 percent of inmates released annually-more than 245,000 people in 2009-could enroll in Medicaid.

This health insurance, combined with new substance abuse services and patient-centered medical home models, could dramatically improve the health and success of former inmates as they return to the community. States should consider several policy changes to ease prisoners' transitions, including suspending rather than terminating Medicaid benefits for offenders; incorporating corrections information into eligibility determination systems; aiming Medicaid outreach and enrollment efforts at prison inmates; and designing comprehensive approaches to meeting former prisoners' health care needs. © 2012 Project HOPE-The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc."

Several initiatives authorized by the Affordable Care Act are intended to improve the health care delivered to dual eligibles and, at the same time, to achieve greater control of spending growth for the two government programs. We examined the 2007 costs and service use associated with dual eligibles. Although the population is indeed costly, we found nearly 40 percent of dual eligibles had lower average per capita spending than non-dual-eligible Medicare beneficiaries. In addition, we found that about 20 percent of dual eligibles accounted for more than 60 percent of combined Medicaid and Medicare spending on the dual-eligible population. But even among these high-cost dual eligibles, we found subgroups. For example, fewer than 1 percent of dual eligibles were in high-cost categories for both Medicare and Medicaid.

Will those who need addiction treatment receive it once they have insurance? To answer that question, we examined the experience of Massachusetts, which implemented its own universal insurance law in 2007. As did the Affordable Care Act, the Massachusetts reform incorporated substance abuse services into the essential benefits to be provided all residents. Prior to the law's enactment, the state estimated that a half-million residents needed substance abuse treatment. Our mixed-methods exploratory study thus asked whether expanded coverage in Massachusetts led to increased addiction treatment, as indicated by admissions, services, or revenues. In fact, we observed relatively stable use of treatment services two years before and two years after the state enacted its universal health care law. Among other factors, our study noted that the percentage of uninsured patients with substance abuse issues remains relatively high-and that when patients did become insured, requirements for copayments on their care deterred treatment. Our analysis suggests that expanded coverage alone is insufficient to increase treatment use. Changes in eligibility, services, financing, system design, and policy may also be required. © 2012 Project HOPE-The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc."

We argue for a more activist approach, based on the Massachusetts experience, which found that consumers want the exchange to act as a trusted adviser and to offer a reasonable set of choices, but not too many. These findings are reflected in the Medicare prescription drug, Advantage, and Medigap markets and in the Dutch and Swiss experiences, which validate the evolving approach of Massachusetts of limiting the number of options, standardizing products, and providing consumer supports. © 2012 Project HOPE-The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc."

States are required to establish exchanges for small businesses and individuals. A federally operated exchange will be established, and states failing to participate in any other exchanges will be mandated to join the federal exchange. Policymakers and health economists believe that exchanges will improve healthcare at lower cost by promoting competition among insurers and by reducing burdensome transaction costs. Consumers will no longer be isolated from monthly insurance premium costs. Exchanges will increase the number of patients insured with more cost-conscious managed care and high-deductible plans. These insurance plan models have historically undervalued emergency medical services, while also underinsuring patients and limiting their healthcare system access to the emergency department. This paradoxically increases demand for emergency services while decreasing supply. The continual devaluation of emergency medical services by insurance payers will result in inadequate distribution of resources to emergency care, resulting in further emergency department closures, increases in emergency department crowding, and the demise of acute care services provided to families and communities."

Although the stroke hospitalization rate has declined, in 2009 there were still almost 1 million hospitalizations for stroke. Many stroke patients, upon discharge, went to another short-stay hospital or a long-term care institution. In addition, outpatient or in-home services (including rehabilitation) are often provided to those who have had a stroke, to prevent future strokes and to restore functioning (6,7). In 2011, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced its ""Million Hearts"" campaign, which aims to prevent 1 million heart attacks and strokes over the next 5 years (8). Efforts like this are especially important because the baby boomer population is aging into the years when strokes are more common. It is important to continue to track the number and rate of stroke hospitalizations, in order to gauge the effects of campaigns like Million Hearts as well as the effectiveness of provisions in health care legislation (including the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act) that promote preventive care and coordination of care.

This study analyzed a large, representative sample of adults in California and found that even when these related factors were considered, people with low health literacy were more likely to be uninsured than those with adequate health literacy. This finding represents the first empirical evidence that low health literacy predicts the lack of health insurance in adults. The study also found that among people who were uninsured, those with low health literacy were sicker and less likely to have ever had health insurance. They were also more likely to be eligible for the expanded Medicaid program under the Affordable Care Act, compared to uninsured respondents with adequate health literacy.

One possible solution is Grand-Aides®, who are health care professionals operating under the direct supervision of nurses, and who are trained and equipped to conduct telephone consultations or make primary care home visits to patients who might otherwise be seen in emergency departments and clinics. We conducted pilot tests with Grand-Aides in two pediatric Medicaid settings: an urban federally qualified health center in Houston, Texas, and a semi-rural emergency department in Harrisonburg, Virginia. We estimated that Grand-Aides and their supervisors averted 62 percent of drop-in visits at the Houston clinic and would have eliminated 74 percent of emergency department visits at the Virginia test site. We calculated the cost of the Grand-Aides program to be $16.88 per encounter. That compares with current Medicaid payments of $200 per clinic visit in Houston and $175 per emergency department visit in Harrisonburg. In addition to reducing health care costs, Grand-Aides have the potential to make a substantial impact in reducing congestion in primary care practices and emergency departments. © 2012 Project HOPE-The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc."

However, only 11 entire counties have official mental health professional shortage designation. This paper presents estimates of the adequacy of the county-level mental health professional workforce. These estimates build on previous work in 4 ways: They account for mental health need as well as provider supply, capture adequacy of the prescriber and nonprescriber workforce, consider mental health services provided by primary care providers, and account for travel across county lines by providers and consumers. Workforce adequacy is measured at the county level by the percentage of rieed for mental health visits that is met by the current supply of prescribers and nonprescribers. Ninety-five of North Carolina's 100 counties have unmet need for prescribers. In contrast, only 7 have unmet need for nonprescribers, and these counties have inadequate numbers of prescribers as well. To eliminate the deficit under current national patterns of care, the state would need about 980 more prescribers. Data limitations constrain findings to focus on percentage of met need rather than supplying exact counts of additional professionals needed. Estimates do not distinguish between public and private sectors of care, nor do they embody a standard of care. North Carolina is working to develop its mental health prescriber workforce. The Affordable Care Act provides new opportunities to develop the mental health workforce, innovative practices involving an efficient mix of professionals, and financing mechanisms to support them."

The material is relevant since the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act enacted by Congress with the support of the President has emphasized the critical importance of patient-based preferences. RECENT FINDINGS: The majority of preference-based, comparative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness vitreoretinal interventions assessed in the US healthcare literature are Value-Based Medicine analyses, thus comparable. These interventions confer a mean patient (human) value gain (improvement in quality of life) of 8.3% [SD 6.3%, 95% confidence interval (CI) + 2.6%]. The average cost-utility of these vitreoretinal interventions is US$23 026/QALY (SD US$24 508, 95% CI + US$8770). Most vitreoretinal interventions are very cost effective using a conventional US standard of US$50 000/QALY as the upper anchor for a very cost-effective intervention, and the World Health Organization of approximately US$142 200/QALY as the upper anchor for a cost-effective intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Most vitreoretinal interventions confer considerable patient value and are very cost effective. Further standardization across healthcare is needed in the preference-based, comparative and cost-utility (cost-effectiveness) arena. The metrics of PPV (percentage patient value) gain and US$/PPV (dollars expended per percentage patient value gain) or financial value gain may be more user-friendly than the QALY. © 2012 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc."

Recent concerns over the potential for H5N1, or ""bird flu,"" to become airborne illustrate the type of epidemic that Justice Breyer may have been envisioning. By broaching this subject now, instead of in the midst of an outbreak, adequate time is left to research appropriate solutions, allow for debate, and provide public education.While vaccination laws are typically promulgated on the state level under state police power, these compulsory laws are accompanied by exemptions that can undermine their effectiveness. For example, religious and philosophical exemptions have led to outbreaks of pertussis, or whooping cough, in multiple states. Considering the various state exemptions along with laws granting governors and health officials broad power to alter vaccination laws during emergencies, it is nearly impossible to predict how individual states will respond.

The variation was not linked to the racial or ethnic makeup of the local population or the rural or urban nature of the region. Instead, interviews with network administrators indicated a substantial contributor to this regional care variation was the state's Access to Care Standards, which restrict network mental health services to children with the most severe disorders. Other factors contributing to the regional variation included funding, the networks' geographic size, and availability of providers.

This study describes the 2005 supply of two important components of the rural PCP workforce: rural osteopathic (DO) and international medical graduate (IMG) PCPs. METHODS: American Medical Association (AMA) and American Osteopathic Association (AOA) 2005 Masterfiles were combined to identify clinically active, non-resident, non-federal physicians aged 70 or younger. Rural-Urban Commuting Area codes were used to categorize practice locations as urban, large rural, small rural, or isolated small rural. National- and state-level analyses were performed. PCPs included family physicians, general internists, and general pediatricians. RESULTS: DOs comprised 4.9% and IMGs 22.2% of the total clinically active workforce. However, they contributed 10.4% and 19.3%, respectively, to the rural PCP workforce, although their relative representation varied geographically. DO PCPs were more likely than allopathic PCPs to practice in rural places (20.5% versus 14.9%, respectively). IMG PCPs were more likely than other PCPs to practice in rural persistent poverty locations (12.4% versus 9.1%). The proportion of rural PCP workforce represented by DOs increased with increasing rurality and that of IMGs decreased. CONCLUSIONS: DO and IMG PCPs constitute a vital portion of the rural health care workforce. Their ongoing participation is necessary in addressing existing rural PCP shortages and handling the influx of newly insured residents as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) comes into effect. The impact on rural DO and IMG PCP supply of ACA measures intended to increase their numbers remains to be seen."

To maximize this opportunity, policy makers need to ensure that participation, or ""take-up,"" among eligible adults exceeds current rates. Using the Current Population Survey 2005-10, we estimated that the nationwide Medicaid participation rate was 62.6 percent among eligible adults ages 19-64 without private insurance. Take-up varied widely by state, from 43.0 percent in Arkansas and Louisiana to 82.8 percent in Massachusetts, after adjusting for population demographics. Participation was highest among disabled adults, 75.8 percent, and lowest among childless adults, 38.3 percent. Factors linked to higher take-up rates included low cost sharing for beneficiaries; more generous benefits; and greater use of managed care programs for Medicaid populations. Factors associated with lower take-up rates included the existence of asset tests in some states. Massachusetts's health reform was associated with a major increase in Medicaid participation. Our results suggest that when Medicaid is expanded in 2014, take-up may be less than anticipated because new enrollees will be offered a more restrictive set of benefits- known as ""benchmark coverage""-compared to those in traditional Medicaid, and the majority of newly eligible adults will be in groups with traditionally low take-up (primarily nondisabled adults). To encourage high participation in the expanded Medicaid program, states will need to offer comprehensive coverage of needed benefits; provide communitybased outreach; and consider more dramatic changes to their enrollment processes, such as automatically enrolling people in Medicaid based on their participation in other public programs. © 2012 Project HOPE-The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc."

The Institute of Medicine and the Department of Health and Human Services have deliberately misled the American people by claiming that this mandate would not include abortifacient drugs, that conscientious objection would be honored, and that this provision is essential to preserving the health of women. The author rebuts each of these claims by appeal to the scientific, medical, legal, and political facts surrounding these claims. In doing so, he argues that the recommendations include at least three abortion-inducing contraceptive methods. Likewise, he illustrates that the current administration has shown no will to protect the inviolable right of conscience of both individuals and institutions. Finally, he draws the reader's attention to the known deleterious side effects of oral contraception, emphasizing that these recommendations ultimately encourage women to use drugs that put them at a greater risk of harm. The author concludes that the Institute of Medicine and the Department of Health and Human Services have neglected their responsibility to American women and have misled and deceived the American people. As the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was nearing passage, Senator Barbara Mikulski (D-Maryland) secured an amendment- the ""Mikulski Women's Preventive Health Care Amendment""- that gave the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) the authority to delineate preventive care uniquely necessary for women. The secretary of HHS, Kathleen Sebelius, tasked the Institute of Medicine (IOM) with undertaking a systematic review of those preventive services that should be covered, without payment, for all women. On July 19, 2011, the IOM submitted a 210-page report recommending eight preventive services. Seven of these recommendations involve important screening, counseling, and testing for common health risks facing women. Recommendation 5.5, unfortunately, was a recommendation of a different kind. It stated, ""Women will have access to all Food and Drug Administration (FDA)- approved contraceptive methods, sterilization procedures, and patient education and counseling. These recommendations do not include abortifacient drugs."" On August 1, 2011, in a quietly made announcement in the corner of the HHS website, the federal government accepted the IOM recommendations wholesale. © 2012 by the Catholic Medical Association.

In addition to deciding the fate of this centerpiece of the Obama Administration's regulatory agenda, the Court's decision will likely affect Commerce Clause doctrine-and related doctrines-for years or even decades to come. Litigants, judges, and academic commentators have focused on whether the Court's ""economic activity"" test, as set forth in United States v. Lopez, permits the individual mandate. This Article approaches the constitutionality of that provision from a novel perspective, one that proves essential in applying past Commerce Clause decisions, including Lopez, to the ACA and in appreciating the real stakes involved in upending the individual mandate. By analyzing the Court's Commerce Clause jurisprudence through the lens of game theory, we expose common features of games that have resulted in limiting state powers on the dormant side of Commerce Clause doctrine, and in sustaining and restricting congressional powers on the affirmative side. Applying such games as ""the prisoners' dilemma,"" ""the driving game,"" and ""the battle of the sexes"" yields critical insights about the nature and limits of state and federal regulatory powers. Our game-theoretical analysis shows that although debates have centered on the role of the individual mandate in solving a micro-level separating game among low-risk individuals who do not purchase insurance and high-risk individuals who cannot afford it, a more compelling account focuses on the Act's role in solving a macro-level separating game played among the states. By comparing the ACA to several important historical policy splits among states-public accommodations laws, abortion funding, the death penalty, civil remedies for violent crimes against women, and same-sex marriage-we demonstrate that the Act, including the individual mandate, fits well within those cases for which congressional commerce power is justified to avoid the risk that competing state policies will force other states into a problematic separating game, thereby undermining the selected regulatory policy. Our analysis reconciles congressional power to implement the ACA with the post-New Deal expansions and recent retrenchments of Congress's Commerce Clause powers, and compel¶lingly reconciles the dormant and affirmative sides of the Supreme Court's Commerce Clause jurisprudence. © 2012, Leslie Meltzer Henry and Maxwell L.

For the former, patient, rather than physician, preferences should be honored, after acquiring and effectively communicating the best available information on the benefits and risks of treatment options.

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act signed into law in 2010 created the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI), which includes an independent, federally appointed Methodology Committee. The Methodology Committee is charged to develop methodological standards for PCOR. The 4 general areas identified by the committee in which standards will be developed are (1) prioritizing research questions, (2) using appropriate study designs and analyses, (3) incorporating patient perspectives throughout the research continuum, and (4) fostering efficient dissemination and implementation of results. A Congressionally mandated PCORI methodology report (to be issued in its first iteration in May 2012) will begin to provide standards in each of these areas, and will inform future PCORI funding announcements and review criteria. The work of the Methodology Committee is intended to enable generation of information that is relevant and trustworthy for patients, and to enable decisions that improve patient-centered outcomes. ©2012 American Medical Association.

Methods: We reviewed research that described the multiple effects of cancer on caregivers' well-being. Five meta-analyses were analyzed to determine the effect of interventions with caregivers on patient and caregiver outcomes. In addition, we reviewed legislation such as the Affordable Care Act and the Family Leave Act along with current primary care practice to determine whether family caregivers' needs have been addressed. Results: Research findings indicate that caregiver stress can lead to psychological and sleep disturbances and changes in caregivers' physical health, immune function, and financial well-being. Research-tested interventions delivered to caregivers of patients with cancer or other chronic illnesses can reduce many of these negative effects and improve caregivers' coping skills, knowledge, and quality of life. Although these interventions also decrease patients' symptoms, reduce mortality (non-dementia patients), and improve patients' physical and mental health, they are seldom implemented in practice. Conclusion: Recommendations for practice include development of standardized guidelines that address caregiver assessment, education, and resources; identification of ""caregiver champions"" in practice settings; provision of referrals to established support organizations for caregivers (eg, Cancer Support Community, Cancer Care); and collaboration among caregiving, professional, and cancer-related organizations to advocate policy and practice changes for family caregivers. © 2012 by American Society of Clinical Oncology."

A key element of reform is the accountable care organization (ACO), which restructures health care delivery such that networks of providers are held responsible for a group of patients they serve. The recently announced Medicare ACO program lays the foundation for 2 of its 3 major goals by allowing ACOs to share in any cost savings, provided they meet quality criteria. Yet it seems that the public health goals of accountable care - arguably the most important of the 3 - have been left behind. To better address public health goals, we propose a novel method for quality reporting within ACOs: introducing an ""expanded denominator"" that attributes patients to a health system if they have ever been seen within the system. An expanded denominator would ensure that ACOs are held accountable not only for patients already engaged in primary care but also for patients with fragmented care and high-risk community members not receiving adequate care. Ultimately, payment reform in Medicare, and potentially Medicaid, must support this new approach to quality measurement for it to have lasting ramifications. ©2012 American Medical Association.

Indeed, the debate surrounding the bill was one of the most intense partisan legislative battles in recent memory. However, the contentiousness of the debate also raises the question of whether the partisanship in Congress surrounding the bill was an anomaly, or if partisan bickering and unwillingness to compromise are here to stay. This Article argues that the health reform debate marked a transition to a modern political reality where compromise and bipartisanship will be rare. After briefly describing the partisan history of the health reform debate, the Article argues that increased partisan news coverage, lack of transparency, and a difficult economic climate have led to an environment in Congress where partisanship is difficult to achieve. However, this Article also points to certain elements of the health reform bill which provide hope that greater compromise and bipartisanship may still be possible, if attempted."

Commonly, programs to contain costs use cuts, such as reductions in payment levels, benefit structures, and eligibility. A less harmful strategy would reduce waste, not value-added care. The opportunity is immense. In just 6 categories of waste-overtreatment, failures of care coordination, failures in execution of care processes, administrative complexity, pricing failures, and fraud and abuse-the sum of the lowest available estimates exceeds 20% of total health care expenditures. The actual total may be far greater. The savings potentially achievable from systematic, comprehensive, and cooperative pursuit of even a fractional reduction in waste are far higher than from more direct and blunter cuts in care and coverage.

Sources were categorized based on type and coded based on neutrality and authority. The category of most-cited sources was newspapers and newswires. While the majority of postings did not use sources (over 97 percent did not cite any source), of those sources coded (n = 460), over a third were clearly biased and/or unauthoritative.

The law, among other things, reauthorizes the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (P.L. 94-3 47, IHCIA), which authorizes many programs and services provided by the Indian Health Service (IHS). In addition, it makes several changes that may affect American Indians and Alaska Natives enrolled in and receiving services from the Medicare, Medicaid, and State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP)-also called Social Security Act (SSA) health benefit programs, and it includes changes to private health insurance that may affect American Indians and Alaska Natives and may affect tribes that offer private health insurance. IHCIA authorizes many IHS programs and services, it sets out the national policy for health services administered to Indians, and it articulates the federal goal of ensuring the highest possible health status for Indians, including urban Indians. In addition, it authorizes direct collections from Medicare, Medicaid, and other third-party insurers. Prior to PPACA, IHCIA was last reauthorized in FY2000, although programs have received appropriations since that time. PPACA reauthorizes IHCIA and extends authorizations of appropriations for IHCIA programs indefinitely. It amends a number of sections of IHCIA in general, to permit tribal organizations (TOs) and urban Indian organizations (UIOs) to apply for contract and grant programs for which they were not previously eligible; to create new mental health prevention and treatment programs, including new youth suicide prevention programs; and to require demonstration projects to construct modular and mobile health facilities in order to expand health services available through IHS, Indian Tribes (ITs), and TOs. It also made several organizational changes to IHS. It requires IHS to establish an Office of Direct Service Tribes to serve tribes that receive their health care and other services directly from IHS as opposed to receiving services through IHS-funded facilities or programs operated by ITs or TOs. In addition, the law requires IHS to develop a plan to establish a new area office to serve tribes in Nevada and requires the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to appoint a new IHS Director of HIV/AIDS Prevention and Treatment. In addition to reauthorizing IHCIA, PPACA includes a number of provisions that may affect American Indians and Alaska Natives who receive services through SSA health benefit programs or who have private insurance coverage. With regard to SSA health benefit programs, the new law permits specified Indian entities to determine Medicaid and CHIP eligibility and extends the period during which IHS, IT, and TO services are reimbursed for all Medicare Part B services, indefinitely, beginning January 1, 2010. Prior to PPACA, authority for these facilities to receive Medicare Part B reimbursements for certain specified services had expired on January 1, 2010. With regard to private insurance coverage, PPACA provides a special enrollment period for American Indians and Alaska Natives who may enroll in private insurance offered through an exchange and excludes tribal health benefits from being counted as gross income for tax purposes. © 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Nationally, consumers would have received almost $2 billion of rebates if the new MLR rules had been in effect in 2010. Almost $1 billion would be in the individual market, where rebates would go to 5.3 million people nationally. Another $1 billion would go to policies covering about 10 million people in the small- and large-group markets."

The ACA is the first comprehensive federal legislation to acknowledge gaps in the workforce caring for the elder population. However, its provisions are inadequate given insufficient supply in the number and types of workers necessary both to meet the caregiving demand of the growing elder population and to implement the delivery system reforms instituted by the ACA. One of the challenges is that the workforce is not prepared for the new service delivery models specified in the legislation. They are not trained, supported, or held accountable for effective care coordination and service integration, and they lack the requisite skills, knowledge, and competencies. Moreover, it is likely to remain difficult to recruit and retain competent direct care workers, who represent the largest component of the long-term care workforce, because of the negative industry image, noncompetitive wages and benefits, a challenging work environment, and inadequate education and training. Several of the ACA provisions for developing the workforce have not received appropriations. Most are also demonstration projects of limited scope and duration. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC."

Data for this study came from 18 to 64 year old smokers in the 2005 National Health Interview Survey. Long-term uninsured (greater than or equal to one year) smokers were less likely to receive physician advice to quit than those continuously-insured in the past year. Being long-term and short-term uninsured (less than one year) was negatively associated with dependence treatments' use in quit attempts compared to the continuously-insured, even though the prevalence of quit attempts were similar between these groups. Intermittent-uninsurance (spell of uninsurance in past year) did not influence cessation services delivery or use. Even though Medicaid-insured smokers were more likely to be advised to quit than those privately-insured, they were less likely to use dependence treatments, especially if they had a spell of uninsurance in the past year.

Political researchers and pundits have speculated endlessly on the many changes mandated by the 2010 national health care reform legislation, styled the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. A review and assessment of this legislation at several levels (federal, state, state agency, local region, and individual business leaders) were undertaken. The results of this expanded analysis suggest strongly that, nationally, members of the business community and their employees will benefit from the legislation early on (years 1 through 3) and then likely will be impacted adversely as the payment mechanisms driving the legislation are tightened by new federal regulations (year 4 onward). As a result of this research, it is surmised that businesses will be immediately impacted by the legislation, with small business owners being the prime beneficiaries of the new legislation, owing to the availability of coverage to approximately 32 million individuals who previously had no access to coverage. In that regard, the soon-to-be-newly insured population also will be a prime beneficiary of the legislation as the limitations on chronic illnesses and other preexisting conditions will be reduced or eliminated by the legislation.

Indeed, the statutory language in some sections of the Affordable Care Act of 2010 creates expectations of pharmacists that will require practice transformation if we are to arise to accept the responsibilities associated with these expectations. These new opportunities open the door for pharmacists to benefit community-dwelling patients with chronic medical conditions, those with acute/emergent care needs, those experiencing a transition between chronic and acute care and vice versa, as well as others in long-term care settings. Although the profession has demonstrated value in many practice environments, our contributions to improved medication-related patient outcomes through medication therapy management (MTM) and the other pharmaceutical care services remain to be rigorously quantified. Incorporation of pharmacists either by their physical presence within the practice or through the design of effective community linkages, such as electronic health records, must be developed to meet the needs of rural and urban patients seen in a variety of practice settings. New business models that build upon cognitive and direct patient care services in addition to the provision of drug products will surely need to emerge for the profession to become a viable and vital component of the US health care system. © 2012 by Harvey Whitney Books Company."

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 contain provisions specific to health care quality that apply to physical therapists. Published evidence examining gaps in the quality of physical therapy services is limited. Objective. The primary purpose of this study was to determine the use of quality indicators in physical therapist practice. Design. This was an observational study. Methods. All members of the Orthopaedic and Private Practice sections of the American Physical Therapy Association were invited to participate by completing an electronic survey. The survey included 22 brief patient descriptions, each followed by questions regarding the use of examinations and interventions based on the 2009 list of Medicare-approved quality measures. Separate multivariate logistic regression models were used to determine the odds ratios related to the performance of each examination and intervention on more than 90% of patients, given perceptions of its importance to care, the burden of performing it, and the level of evidence supporting its use. Results. Participants (n=2,544) reported a relatively low frequency of performing examinations and interventions supporting primary and secondary prevention (3.6%- 51.3%) and use of standardized measures (5.5%-35.8%). Perceptions of high importance and low burden were associated with greater odds of performing an examination or intervention. Importance and burden were more influential factors than the perceived availability of evidence to support use of identified techniques. Limitations. The survey was not assessed for test-retest reliability. A low response rate was a source of potential bias. Conclusion. The study findings suggest that physical therapists may not see themselves as providers of primary or secondary prevention services. Patient management strategies associated with these types of services also may be perceived as relatively unimportant or burdensome. © 2012 American Physical Therapy Association."

OBJECTIVE: Among patients with type 2 diabetes, to examine the association between patients' self-reported financial pressures on cost-related medication nonadherence and glucose control. Additionally, to examine whether having insurance decrease the financial pressures of diabetes care. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: Racially/ethnically diverse patients (N=1,361; 249 non-Hispanic whites, 194 Vietnamese, and 533 Mexican American) with type 2 diabetes were recruited from seven outpatient clinics for a cross-sectional, observational study. KEY RESULTS: Although both Vietnamese and Mexican- American patients reported having low annual incomes, more Mexican Americans reported the presence of financial barriers to getting medical care and perceived financial burden due to their diabetes, compared to whites and Vietnamese (p<0.001). Over half (53.2%) of Mexican Americans reported cost-related non-adherence compared to 27.2% of white and 27.6% of Vietnamese patients (p<0.001). Perceived financial burden was found to be associated with poor glucose control (HbA1c =8%), after adjusting for sociodemographic and health characteristics (aOR=1.70, 95%CI 1.09-2.63), but not when adjusting for non-adherence. Similarly, a significant association between presence of financial barriers and HbA1c (aOR=1.69, 95%CI 1.23-2.32) was attenuated with the inclusion of insurance status in the model. Being uninsured (aOR=1.90, 95%CI 1.13-3.21) and nonadherent (aOR=1.49, 95%CI 1.06-2.08) were each independently associated with HbA1c. CONCLUSIONS:While having health insurance coverage eliminated some of the financial barriers associated with having diabetes, low-income patients still faced significant financial burdens. Thus, providing health insurance to more individuals is only the first step towards eliminating health disparities. It is important to address medication cost in order to improve medication adherence and glucose control. © Society of General Internal Medicine 2012."

DESIGN: A prospective study to determine rates of unconsumed medication and the net-cost impact on Medicare Part D prescription drug plans based on the proposed and final CMS rule and other scenarios under consideration by CMS. SETTING: Four hundred twenty-five long-term care facilities in six states. PATIENTS: Residents covered by Medicare Part D. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Rates of unconsumed medication, average dispensing fees, potential reduction in unconsumed medication, incremental fills, incremental dispensing fees, net cost or savings to Medicare Part D plans, and percentage increase in fills. RESULTS: Total estimates of the cost of unconsumed medication charged to Medicare Part D plans for residents in long-term care facilities are $87 million for brand products and $39 million for generics annually. Based on current dispensing fees, it is likely that implementation of the final rule will result in incremental costs to CMS plans in the range of $30 million annually. The number of Medicare Part D prescription fills will increase by about 20%. A seven-day fill requirement on brand products would raise incremental costs to more than $150 million annually, and inclusion of generic products in a seven-day fill requirement would result in incremental costs in the range of $850 million annually. CONCLUSION: The final CMS rule on short-fills is unlikely to result in savings to Medicare Part D plans. Shorter fill times and inclusion of generic products would significantly raise costs to these plans. © 2012 American Society of Consultant Pharmacists, Inc. All rights reserved."

Soon after the law's passage, several lawsuits challenged the constitutionality of the individual mandate, a key provision requiring nearly every American to carry a minimum level of health insurance or face a penalty. Courts have split on whether the individual mandate is outside the scope of Congress's constitutional authority, and those that have struck down the provision have had to address what fate should befall the remainder of the law. Severability doctrine is the exclusive mechanism for the courts to deal with questions of partial unconstitutionality in statutes. As of this writing, three courts have addressed the mandate's severability. All have come to divergent conclusions on if, and how much of, the law can be allowed to stand if the mandate is excised. This Comment analyzes the split of authority regarding the severability of the individual mandate. It asserts that the approach taken by the Eleventh Circuit-striking the mandate while leaving the remainder of the law intact-is the appropriate course of action for the Supreme Court if it finds that the mandate is unconstitutional. This Comment concludes that the judiciary would overstep its constitutional boundaries if it were to strike additional provisions of PPACA, and that any subsequent re-working of the Act is a task reserved for the legislature."

In anticipation of changes in the national health care system, we report baseline rates of these hospitalizations and describe trends by race over 15 years. Methods: We used National Hospital Discharge Survey data from 1995 through 2009, which represent approximately 1% of hospitalizations in the United States each year. We calculated age-, sex-, and race-stratified rates and age- and sexstandardized rates for preventable CHF hospitalizations on the basis of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's specifications, which use civilian population estimates from the US Census Bureau as the denominator for rates. Results: Approximately three-fourths of the hospitalizations occurred among people aged 65 years or older. In each subgroup and period, rates were significantly higher (P <.05) for blacks than whites. Only black men aged 18 to 44 showed a linear increase (P =.004) in crude rates across time. Subpopulations aged 65 or older, except black men, showed a linear decrease (P <.05) in crude rates over time. Age- and sex-standardized rates showed a significant linear decrease in rates for whites (P =.01) and a borderline decrease for blacks (P =.06) Conclusion: Before implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, we found that blacks were disproportionately affected by preventable CHF hospitalizations compared with whites. Our results confirm recent findings that preventable CHF hospitalization rates are declining in whites more than blacks. Alarmingly, rates for younger black men are on the rise."

Thirty-four states previously enacted similar laws. The authors sought to examine the impact on access to care of state laws extending eligibility of parents' insurance to young adults. METHODS: By using a difference-in- differences analysis, we examined the 2002-2004 and 2008-2009 Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System to compare 3 states enacting laws in 2005 or 2006 with 17 states that have not enacted laws on 4 outcomes: self-reported health insurance coverage, identification of a personal physician/clinician, physical exam from a physician within the past 2 years, and forgoing care in the past year due to cost. RESULTS: For each outcome there was differential improvement among states enacting laws compared with states without laws. Health insurance differentially increased 0.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], -3.8% to 4.2%), from 67.6% to 68.1% pre-post in states enacting laws and from 68.5% to 68.7% in states without. Personal physician/ clinician identification differentially increased 0.9% (95% CI -3.1% to 5.0%), from 62.4% to 65.5% in states enacting laws and from 58.0% to 60.2% in states without. Recent physical exams differentially increased significantly 4.6% (95% CI, 0%-9.2%), from 77.3% to 81.2% in states enacting laws and from 76.2% to 75.5% in states without. Forgone care due to cost differentially decreased significantly 3.9% (95% CI, -0.3% to -7.5%), from 20.4% to 18.2% in states enacting laws and from 17.8% to 19.4% in states without. CONCLUSIONS: States that expanded eligibility to parents' insurance in 2005 or 2006 experienced improvements in access to care among young adults.

DeVoe and colleagues previously estimated that the cost of a family health insurance premium would equal the median household income by the year 2025. A slowdown in health care spending tied to the recent economic downturn and the passage of the PPACA occurred after this model was published. In this updated model, we estimate that this threshold will be crossed in 2033, and under favorable assumptions the PPACA may extend this date only to 2037. Continuing to make incremental changes in US health policy will likely not bend the cost curve, which has eluded policy makers for the past 50 years.

Passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) presents both opportunities and significant challenges for this system. The health reform law will extend health insurance coverage to more than 30 million individuals by 2014. At the same time, it will invest significantly in building provider and clinic capacity, as well as in more coordinated and integrated care delivery systems (Summer 2011). This influx of patients will place increased demands on a system that is already experiencing capacity, financial, and workforce stressors. This issue brief focuses on some of the daily challenges facing the safety net, as well as new challenges and opportunities that will emerge as health reform unfolds. Philanthropy has long supported many aspects of the safety net, including developing the business and clinical structure and infrastructure, such as health information technology and strengthening the primary care and paraprofessional workforce. Philanthropy has also helped increase the capacity of community clinics and other safety net providers and expand the services associated with patient-centered care models to include translation, transportation, health literacy support, and community prevention.

The environment was fairly predictable, and returns on investment came quickly. With little difficulty, a private practice could increase the total services it provided, resulting in increased patient encounters and increased profit. But the growth of Maryland's largest and oldest orthopaedic practice came with a price: a jumbled, imposing document known as ""the matrix"" that governed a troubled appointment process. OrthoMaryland knew the matrix had to go but lacked an incentive to do the work needed to replace it. Then came the recession, which made borrowing money for a private specialty practice like OrthoMaryland as difficult as borrowing money for a home loan. At the same time, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is transforming the way private practices will be reimbursed for services. The changes to the fee-for-service model plus the increased emphasis on patient satisfaction meant the practice would need to both increase the number of patients seen and make them more satisfied at the same time.

Although this legislation provides a mechanism for uninsured Americans to obtain coverage, it excludes undocumented immigrants (UDI). Reimbursement for UDIs comes from the disproportionate share hospital (DSH) program and was previously supported by Section-1011 of the 2003 Medicare Modernization Act (S1011). The PPACA details a cut of DSH funds starting in 2014. This could impose a significant financial burden on trauma centers. METHODS: From May 2005 to May 2008, we retrospectively reviewed all trauma-related emergency room visits by UDIs. We quantified charges for three entities: emergency department physicians, trauma surgeons, and the hospital. We applied our average institutional collection rate to these charges and compared these projected collections with the actual collections. RESULTS: Over a three-year period, we identified 1,325 trauma UDIs. The financial records revealed a projected emergency department physicians collection of $452,686, a projected trauma surgeons collection of $1.2 million, and a projected hospital collection of $6.9 million (total $8.6 million). Actual funding from S1011 provided $1.7 million and DSH provided $1.9 million (total $3.6 million). Texas State Funding and UDI self-payment contributed $611,082. Overall, our institution had a reimbursement discrepancy of $4.3 million with DSH/S1011 assistance. This increased to $6.0 million after the termination of S1011 and may increase to $7.9 million under PPACA. CONCLUSION: These figures underestimate the total cost of UDI trauma care as it only includes three entities. Our data represent a fraction of national figures. Failure to address these issues could result in ongoing financial problems for trauma centers. Copyright © 2012 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins."

Simultaneously, health care providers and systems are under pressure to provide better and more proficient care. The landscape of the US health care system is shaped by federal and private payers which continue to develop initiatives designed to curtail costs. These include value-based reimbursement programs; cost-shifting expenses to the consumer and reducing reimbursement of providers and facilities. Moreover, there is an underlying thought to steer provision of health care to theoretically more efficient settings. Many of these initiatives are based on affordable health care reform. The major aspects of curtailing health care costs include hospital and other facility payments as well as physician payments and reductions in the approved services. Consequently, ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs) are not immune to these changes. Until 1970, all surgery was performed in hospitals The development of ASCs and site of service differential payments for in-office procedures have changed the dynamics of surgical trends with outpatient surgeries outpacing inpatient surgeries by as early as 1989. By 2008, approximately 65% of procedures were performed in all outpatient settings including hospital outpatient departments. ASCs claim that improved efficiency in health care delivery allows patients to spend less time in the health care setting with quicker turn over, improving the productivity of the health care team. However, since the majority of the ASCs are owned, in part, by the physicians who staff them, the financial incentives related to ownership have been alleged to potentially alter provider behavior. The number of Medicare certified ASCs and total Medicare payments from 1999 to 2010 increased significantly, but more recent year-to-year changes are far less substantial when compared to previous years. Net percent revenue growth from 2008 to 2009 was 3.2% and from 2009 to 2010 was 6.2% with an overall increase from 1999 of 183% over a period of 11 years. Similarly, the number of Medicare certified ASCs increased from 2,786 in 1999 to 5,316 in 2010, 1.1% increased from 2009 to 2010, however, a 91% increase from 1999 over a period of 11 years. Interventional pain management is one of the fastest growing specialties with a footprint in multiple disciplines. Interventional pain management in ASC settings has come a long way since June 1998 proposed Health Care Financing Administration's ASC rule which seriously compromised interventional pain management in the ASC setting. There are many payment challenges facing interventional pain management (IPM) in 2012. Significant changes continue to occur in the payment systems with policies of paying a certain percent of hospital outpatient department payments to ASCs which declined from 63% in 2008 to 56% in 2011, with substantial reductions for add-on codes. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) evaluation of IPM codes also consists of multiple misvalued codes. In conclusion, overall the future of ASCs may appear optimistic, but in the near perspective, specifically in 2012 to 2014, there will be challenging times specifically for interventional pain management centers with the regulatory environment and rapid changes taking place with or without implementation of Affordable Care Act."

Our analysis shows the fee increase would increase primary care visits by 8.8 percent, and raise the overall cost of primary care visits by 17 percent. However, these increases would yield more than a sixfold annual return in lower Medicare costs for other services-mostly inpatient and postacute care-once the full effects on treatment patterns are realized. The net result would be a drop in Medicare costs of nearly 2 percent. These findings suggest that, under reasonable assumptions, promoting primary care can help bend the Medicare cost curve."

Traditional economic analysis is based on the premise that these are rational decisions, but it is hard to reconcile observed enrollment patterns with this view. The policy prescriptions that the traditional model generates may thus fail to achieve their goals. Behavioral economics, which integrates insights from psychology into economic analysis, identifies important deviations from the traditional assumptions of rationality and can thus improve our understanding of what drives health insurance take-up and improved policy design. Methods: Rather than a systematic review of the coverage literature, this article is a primer for considering issues in health insurance coverage from a behavioral economics perspective, supplementing the standard model. We present relevant evidence on decision making and insurance take-up and use it to develop a behavioral approach to both the policy problem posed by the lack of health insurance coverage and possible policy solutions to that problem. Findings: We found that evidence from behavioral economics can shed light on both the sources of low take-up and the efficacy of different policy levers intended to expand coverage. We then applied these insights to policy design questions for public and private insurance coverage and to the implementation of the recently enacted health reform, focusing on the use of behavioral insights to maximize the value of spending on coverage. Conclusions: We concluded that the success of health insurance coverage reform depends crucially on understanding the behavioral barriers to take-up. The take-up process is likely governed by psychology as much as economics, and public resources can likely be used much more effectively with behaviorally informed policy design. © 2012 Milbank Memorial Fund."

This study characterized changes in health insurance coverage among reproductive-age women in the United States from 2000 to 2009. Methods: Data from female respondents (ages 18-49) to the National Health Interview Surveys, 2000 to 2009 (n = 207,968), including those pregnant when surveyed (n = 3,204), were used in a repeated cross-sectional design. Changes over time were estimated using longitudinal regression models. Main Findings: Of the reproductive-age women in this study, 25% were uninsured at some point in the prior year. Ten percent of pregnant women reported currently being uninsured, and 27% and 58% reported Medicaid coverage or private health insurance, respectively. Among women who were not pregnant, 19% were currently uninsured, 8% had Medicaid, and 68% had private coverage. From 2000 to 2009, an increasing percentage of reproductive-age women reported having gone without health insurance in the past year. Controlling for sociodemographic and health variables, the chances that a reproductive-age woman had been uninsured increased by approximately 1.5% annually (p <.001), and did not differ between pregnant women and those who were not pregnant. The odds that an insured pregnant woman had Medicaid coverage increased 7% per year over the study period (p <.001), whereas the odds of private coverage decreased. Conclusion: Reproductive-age women are increasingly at risk of being uninsured, which raises concerns about access to prenatal and preconception care. Among pregnant women, access to private health insurance has decreased, and state Medicaid programs have covered a growing percentage of women.

However, nutrition's vital role in preventing diseases and conditions potentially could translate to additional opportunities for RDs as a result of this reform. Specific dietetics-related areas targeted by health care reform include medical nutrition therapy for chronic conditions and employee wellness incentive programs. However, dietetics practitioners are not necessarily established in the language of the bill as the essential providers of specific services or as reimbursable practitioners. Thus, although it is possible health care reform could affect demand-and, in turn, supply-of RDs, the actual effect of this legislation is difficult to predict. © 2012 Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics."

SAMHSA pursues this mission at a time of significant change. Health reform has been enacted, bringing sweeping improvements in how the United States delivers, pays for, and monitors health care. The evidence base behind behavioral healthi prevention, treatment, and recovery services continues to grow and promises better outcomes for people with and at risk for mental and substance use disorders.ii All of this change is happening at a time when State budgets are shrinking and fiscal restraint is a top priority. Recognizing the need to balance these opportunities and challenges, SAMHSA has identified eight Strategic Initiatives to focus its limited resources on areas of urgency and opportunity. The Initiatives will enable SAMHSA to respond to national, State, Territorial,iii Tribal, and local trends and support implementation of the Affordable Care Act and the Mental Health Parity and Addictions Equity Act. People are at the core of SAMHSA's mission, and these Initiatives will guide SAMHSA's work through 2014 to help people with mental and substance use disorders and their families build strong and supportive communities, prevent costly and painful behavioral health problems, and promote better health for all Americans. Each Initiative has an overarching purpose, specific goals, action steps, and measures for determining success. In addition, three issues cut across all of the Initiatives: behavioral health disparities, health reform, and workforce development.

SAMHSA awards formula and competitive grants under its authorities in Title V of the Public Health Service Act (PHSA). The agency also administers the $1.8 billion Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment (SAPT) block grant and the $420 million Community Mental Health Services (CMHS) block grant, both of which are authorized in PHSA Title XIX. SAMHSA's funding totaled almost $3.6 billion in FY2010. The agency's budget increased by 34% from FY2000 to FY2010. In real (i.e., inflation-adjusted) dollars, however, the funding increase over that period was only 6%. Funding for SAMHSA's two block grants, which together account for 62% of the agency's budget, has grown at a much slower pace than funding for its competitive grant programs. SAMHSA was reauthorized in 2000, as part of the Children's Health Act (P.L. 106-310). The act amended SAMHSA's existing authorities to give the agency more flexibility to direct mental health and substance abuse funding; increased state flexibility to direct the use of block grant funds, creating several new competitive grant programs to expand mental health and substance abuse services for children and adolescents; and authorized appropriations through FY2003. It also added charitable choice provisions that allow faith-based organizations to compete for SAMHSA substance abuse funding without impairing their religious character. P.L. 106-310 required SAMHSA to submit two reports to Congress, one on providing coordinated care to individuals with co-occurring mental illness and substance abuse, and the other on efforts to improve the flexibility and accountability of the block grants. Comprehensive reauthorization has not occurred since 2000. However, several laws have further expanded the agency's programs and activities in suicide prevention, underage drinking, and prescription drug abuse. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-148) contained new authorizations for SAMHSA related to depression and behavioral health services for American Indians and Alaskan Natives, as well as additional provisions related to mental health and substance abuse. While reauthorization has not moved out of committee, issues that may be of interest during the next reauthorization of SAMHSA include increased performance measurement and accountability for SAMHSA grants and programs, granting specific authority for the Access To Recovery program that provides vouchers for individuals to seek treatment services, improving the ability of communities to provide behavioral health services during disaster response, requiring collaboration between SAMHSA and other federal agencies, increasing SAMHSA's level of emphasis on primary prevention, increasing SAMHSA's role in expanding the number and diversity of the behavioral health provider workforce, and ensuring fairness of the formula used to distribute SAMHSA's block grants. This report describes SAMHSA's history, organization, authority, and programs, and analyzes some of the issues that may be considered by Congress during a reauthorization of the agency.

A portion of the uninsured reflects unemployment rates; however, this rate is primarily a reflection of the fact that when most health plans meet an individual's needs, most times, those health plans are not affordable. Research shows that people without health insurance are more likely to experience financial burdens associated with the utilization of health care services. But even among the insured, underinsurance has emerged as a barrier to care. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) has made the most comprehensive changes to the provision of health insurance since the development of Medicare and Medicaid by requiring all Americans to have health insurance by 2016. An estimated 30 million individuals who would otherwise be uninsured are expected to obtain insurance through the private health insurance market or state expansion of Medicaid programs. The success of the ACA depends on the design of the essential health benefits (EHB) package and its affordability. Essential Health Benefits recommends a process for defining, monitoring, and updating the EHB package.

The new law requires that insurers and health plans provide coverage for individuals participating in clinical trials. Currently, there are states that already have laws or agreements requiring clinical trial coverage, but there remain deficiencies that will need to be addressed to achieve compliance with the new law. Methods: State mandates were reviewed to determine current laws and agreements. The ACA was reviewed to outline its provisions, and these were compared with current mandates to identify deficiencies. Results: Eighteen states meet the requirements set forth by the ACA either through a state law or agreement; 33 states do not meet the requirements. Of these 33 states, 15 do not have any existing laws or agreements in place regarding clinical trials. In states that have deficient policies in place, the most common deficiency is the lack of phase I coverage. The second most common deficiency in policy is coverage of only therapeutic studies. Conclusion: Most states currently do not meet the requirements of the ACA and will be required to make changes by 2014. The implications of the ACA with regard to insurance coverage of clinical trials remain unclear as implementation of the legislation unfolds. State governments can take steps to ensure insurance coverage by creating and expanding agreements with insurance companies. © 2011 by American Society of Clinical Oncology."

However, small businesses can avoid many of the new regulations by self-insuring or maintaining grandfathered plans. If small firms with healthy and lower-cost enrollees avoid the regulations, premiums for coverage sold through insurance exchanges could be unaffordable. In this analysis we used the RAND Comprehensive Assessment of Reform Efforts microsimulation model to predict the effects of self-insurance and grandfathering exemptions on coverage and premiums available through the exchanges. We estimate that Affordable Care Act regulations restricting employers' ability to offer grandfathered plans will result in lower premiums on plans available through the exchanges and will have small negative effects on enrollment in the exchanges. Our results suggest that these regulations are essential to keeping premiums on the Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP) exchanges affordable.

It reviews provisions in the act and recent proposed regulations intended to mitigate the problem of risk selection. We performed a simulation that showed that under the premium rating restrictions in the law, large incentives for insurers to attract healthier enrollees will be likely to persist-resulting in substantial overpayment to plans with very healthy enrollees and underpayment to plans with very sick members. We conclude that risk adjustment based on patients' diagnoses, such as will be in place from 2014 on, will yield payments to insurers that will be more accurate than what will come solely from the age-adjusted and other rating allowed by the act.

This article examines the experiences of states that enacted dependent expansion laws. Drawing on public information from thirty-one enacting states and case studies of four diverse reform states, it derives lessons that are pertinent to the implementation of this ACA provision. Dependent coverage laws vary across the states, but most impose residency, marital status, and other restrictions. The federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act further limits the reach of state laws. Eligibility for expanded coverage under the ACA is much broader. Rules in some states requiring or allowing separate premiums for adult dependents may also discourage enrollment compared with rules in other states (and the ACA), where these costs must be factored into family premiums. Business opposition in some states led to more restrictive regulations, especially for how premiums are charged, which in turn raised greater implementation challenges. Case study states did not report substantial young adult dependent coverage take-up, but early enrollment experience under ACA appears to be more positive. Long-term questions remain about the implications of this policy for risk pooling and the distribution of premium costs. © 2012 by Duke University Press."

Aspects of the reform law could motivate small businesses to self-insure, rather than participate in state-regulated markets either inside or outside the new health insurance exchanges. If younger or healthier groups self-insure, premiums for insured plans might rise to an extent that could seriously impair the regulated market. States can influence small businesses to participate in the regulated market by making it more difficult or costly to obtain stop-loss coverage, which selffunded employers rely on to protect their businesses from catastrophic medical costs incurred by one or more insured workers. States can limit the comprehensiveness of stop-loss coverage, ban stop-loss coverage outright, or regulate it as they do primary coverage. But states need federal guidance about how to exercise this authority if they are to promote, or prevent the undermining of, important aspects of federal health care reform.©2012 Project HOPE- The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc."

States have considerable flexibility in how they design and implement these exchanges. We analyze several key design options being considered, using the Urban Institute's Health Insurance Policy Simulation Model: creating separate versus merged small-group and nongroup markets, eliminating age rating in these markets, removing the small-employer credit, and setting the maximum number of employees for firms in the small-group market at 50 versus 100 workers. Among our findings are that merging the small-group and nongroup markets would result in 1.7 million more people nationwide participating in the exchanges and, because of greater affordability of nongroup coverage, approximately 1.0 million more people being insured than if the risk pools were not merged. The various options generate relatively small differences in overall coverage and cost, although some, such as reducing age rating bands, would result in higher costs for some people while lowering costs for others. These cost effects would be most apparent among people who purchase coverage without federal subsidies. On the whole, we conclude that states can make these design choices based on local support and preferences without dramatic repercussions for overall coverage and cost outcomes. © 2012 Project HOPE-The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc."

US health care, however, is not ""broken""; rather, it functions according to purpose. The legal standard sets health care's purpose as high-quality care, not care at a pervasive quantity or low cost. Juries focus on quality irrespective of cost, and the court's concern is not cost but whether the defendant physician has met the standard of care. As the US health system does deliver high-quality (albeit high-cost) care, it is not broken; instead, the system that defines it is broken. The legal system defines the standard of care as the care that an average physician would deliver under similar circumstances. As 91% of physicians admit to practicing defensively excessive care, the legal care standard is therefore excessive care. However, the new health care legislation passed by Congress does not address tort reform. Instead, it reduces physician remuneration and increases penalty-driven cost care control regulations. Caught between a care standard that demands high quality regardless of cost and penalty-driven federal mandates demanding low-cost care regardless of the legal care standard, physicians bear the new law's ultimate burden. US health care should not continue to focus on quality over cost and quantity; more important, the law should not continue to dictate that it do so. Rather, the system must import cost-effective care, and the law must so direct. To reduce health care costs, the legal system must first recognize a standard of care that respects cost-or tort reform that protects those physicians who do. © 2012 The American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery, Inc."

Objective: To examine associations of health characteristics with acquisition and loss of private and public health insurance. Research Design and Participants:: Prospective observational analysis of 2000 to 2007 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey data for persons aged 18 to 63 on entry, enrolled for 2 years. We modeled year 2 private and public insurance gain and loss. Measures: Dependent variables: year 2 insurance status [none (reference), any private insurance, or public insurance] among those uninsured in year 1 (N=13,022), and retaining or losing coverage in year 2 among those privately or publicly insured in year 1 (N=47,239). Independent variables: age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, income, region, urbanity, health status, health conditions, year 1 health expenditures, year 1 and 2 employment status, and (in secondary analyses) skepticism toward medical care and insurance. Results: In adjusted analyses, lower income and education were associated with not gaining and with losing private insurance. Poorer health status was associated with public insurance gain. Smoking and being overweight were associated with not gaining private insurance, and smoking with losing private coverage. Secondary analyses adjusting for medical skepticism yielded similar findings. Conclusions: Social disadvantage and poorer health status are associated with gaining public insurance, whereas social advantage, not smoking, and not being overweight are associated with gaining private insurance, even when adjusting for attitudes toward medical care. Private insurers seem to benefit from relatively low health risk selection. © 2012 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins."

Although federal assistance programs for adoption focus primarily on children adopted out of foster care, federal adoption tax provisions are available for all adoptions (except for adoptions of stepchildren). Congress created federal tax assistance for adoption by enacting the Small Business and Job Protection Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-188). The act added tax incentives for adoption to the existing federal adoption assistance grant programs by creating a tax credit and an income tax exclusion of up to $5,000 per adoption and $6,000 per adoption of a special needs child. The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 (EGTRRA, P.L. 107-16) increased qualified expenses for the credit (and the income tax exclusion) to $10,000 (indexed for inflation), but with a sunset period. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (P.L. 111-148) provided, for tax years 2010 and 2011 only, that the adoption tax credit be refundable. P.L. 111-148 also increased the qualified expenses for the adoption tax credit and the income tax exclusion for employer provided adoption assistance to $13,170 for tax year 2010, with this amount indexed for inflation in 2011. The Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-312) extended the EGTRRA provisions for adoption to tax year 2012. Beginning in tax year 2013, pre-EGTRRA law will be effective-a $6,000 limitation and applicable for special needs adoptions only, no income exclusion for employer provided adoption assistance, and the adoption tax credit will be nonrefundable. The tax credit and the income tax exclusion significantly limit who may benefit from the tax provisions. Both provisions are subject to a phase-out rule (which creates an income cap). These provisions, combined with the nonrefundability of the credit in prior years, limited the number of taxpayers who benefited from the credit. As a result, in tax year 2008, very few families with an adjusted gross income of less than $30,000, or with an adjusted gross income of $200,000 or more, claimed the credit. In tax year 2008, approximately 86,600 tax returns, or .06% of all tax returns, included a claim for the adoption tax credit, with a total credit value claimed of $353.5 million. Policy issues associated with the tax provisions are the limited availability of the credit resulting from the phase-out rule, more generous provisions for domestic adoptions and for adoptions of special needs children, and whether the tax system is the most efficient means of providing federal assistance for adoption.

Unfortunately, health workforce shortages like these are being advanced as cause for repealing or ""defunding"" the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The extension of health insurance coverage to millions of Americans is a critical first step toward a healthier America. It would be a national failure to leave millions of Americans without health insurance coverage because they will generate additional demand. Rather, the solution is to find ways to meet that demand. Workforce projections utilizing real data and carefully formulated assumptions to assess how and why supply and demand change over time can greatly assist policy makers in finding those solutions. With implementation of the ACA under way, it is time to understand what lessons such projections can teach, and to begin to heed those lessons. © 2012 by Annual Reviews. All rights reserved."

The greater public spending associated with many of these changes was initially widely supported, but has now become the subject of sustained criticism from conservative economists and politicians whose self-confidence has rapidly recovered from the blow initially rendered to it by the financial meltdown. After the 2010 midterm elections, with control of the House of Representatives returned to fiscally conservative Republican legislators, deficit reduction emerged as the dominant issue in Washington politics, constraining the capacity of the White House to effectively pursue further stimulus spending. © The Author 2012.

Under our interpretation of section 3304 of the Affordable Care Act, if the death of a beneficiary's spouse would decrease or eliminate the subsidy provided by the Extra Help program, we will extend the effective period of eligibility for the most recent determination or redetermination until one year after the month following the month we are notified of the death of the spouse. The effective date of this provision was January 1, 2011. We also revised our regulations to incorporate changes made by the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 (MIPPA) which affect the way we account for income and resources when determining eligibility for the Extra Help program. The statute provides that we no longer count the value of any life insurance policy as a resource for Extra Help effective on and after January 1, 2010. As of that date, we also no longer count as income the help a beneficiary receives when someone else provides food and shelter, or pays household bills for food, mortgage, rent, electricity, water, property taxes, or heating fuel or gas.

The use of predictive modeling as part of the discharge process is used as a way to highlight just one of the common processes that will need to be transformed to maximize reimbursement under the Accountable Care Organization model. The purpose of this article is to summarize what has been learned about predictive modeling from the population health management industry perspective, to discuss how that knowledge might be applied to discharge planning in the Accountable Care Organization model of patient care, and then to outline how the Accountable Care Organization environment presents various challenges, opportunities, and implications for the case management role. Primary Practice Setting(S): Hospitals, physician practices. Findings/Conclusions: The development of predictive models to identify patients at risk for readmission is described and how such models can positively impact the discharge planning process by lowering readmission rates. Examples of the structural, operational, cultural, and case management role changes necessary to maximize the benefits of an Accountable Care Organization are described. Implications For Case Management Practice: There is a growing need for advanced practice nurses to fill the leadership, resource management, analytical, informatics-based, and organizational development roles that are sorely needed to advance the Accountable Care Organization model of care. Case managers are well-positioned to lend their expertise to the development efforts, but they will need to be educationally prepared for the many advanced practice roles that will emerge as our nation evolves this new system of health care delivery. © 2012 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins."

Endorsed by the American Medical Association and a number of primary care-focused organizations, the American College of Surgeons (ACS) and nearly all other surgical associations opposed the bill. This divergence stems not from direct disagreement over provisions in the bill but from opposition to or support of certain provisions with direct implications for the physicians represented by a given organization, as well as the relative importance of provisions for which these organizations share a common opinion. Regarding the field of pediatric plastic surgery, the surgical perspective of the ACS and the American Society of Plastic Surgeons and the medical perspective of the American Academy of Pediatrics align on many issues. Given the lack of specificity of any of the provisions for a field as specialized as pediatric plastic surgery, this review will focus on broader implications of the PPACA both for medical and surgical needs of pediatric patients and for the surgeons providing their care. The provisions of the PPACA are distributed along an implementation timeline, with some major changes having already occurred. The popularity of some of the early provisions, many pertaining to the pediatric population, has implications for any attempt at repeal of the law as a whole in coming years.

One such existing law, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA), is a civil rights statute and has as its purpose the prohibition of discrimination against individuals on the basis of genetic information. In order to effectuate this prohibition, GINA not only contains certain requirements for health insurance and a general prohibition of employment discrimination provisions, but also has strong privacy protections. On the other hand, PPACA is comprehensive health care legislation that is intended to, among other things, enhance consumer protections in the private health insurance market.

PPACA, the more recent statute, does not specifically amend GINA and also does not reference GINA's requirements.

PPACA also expands eligibility for Medicaid; amends the Medicare program in ways that are intended to reduce the growth in Medicare spending that had been projected under preexisting law; imposes an excise tax on insurance plans found to have high premiums; and makes other changes to the tax code, Medicare, Medicaid, and many other federal programs.PPACA includes numerous appropriations that provide billions of dollars to support new or existing grant programs and other activities. Several other provisions require the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to transfer amounts from the Medicare Part A and Part B trust funds for specified purposes. This report summarizes all these mandatory spending provisions. They include funding for a temporary insurance program for individuals who have been uninsured for several months and have a preexisting condition, as well as funding for states to plan and establish exchanges. PPACA also provides funding for various Medicare and Medicaid demonstration programs, for the creation of a Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation to test and implement innovative payment and service delivery models, and for an independent board to provide Congress with proposals for reducing Medicare cost growth and improving quality of care for Medicare beneficiaries.In addition, PPACA appropriates funding for health workforce and maternal and child health programs, and establishes three multi-billion dollar funds. The first fund will provide a total of $11 billion over five years in supplemental funding for community health centers and the National Health Service Corps.

The third fund, which is funded in perpetuity, is intended to support prevention, wellness, and other public health-related programs and activities authorized under the Public Health Service Act (PHSA). Lawmakers opposed to PPACA have introduced numerous bills in the 112th Congress, several of which have seen legislative action.

The NHSC provides scholarships and student loan repayments to individuals who agree to a period of service as a primary care provider in a federally designated Health Professional Shortage Area. In addition, the new law seeks to address concerns about the current size, specialty mix, and geographic distribution of the health care workforce. It reauthorizes and expands existing health workforce education and training programs under Titles VII and VIII of the Public Health Service Act (PHSA). Title VII supports the education and training of physicians, dentists, physician assistants, and public health workers through grants, scholarships, and loan repayment. PPACA creates several new programs to increase training experiences in primary care, in rural areas, and in community - based settings, and provides training opportunities to increase the supply of pediatric subspecialists and geriatricians. It also expands the nursing workforce development programs authorized under PHSA Title VIII to bolster undergraduate and graduate nursing education and training. As part of a comprehensive framework for federal community-based (i.e., public health) prevention activities, including a national strategy and a national education and outreach campaign, PPACA authorizes several new grant programs with a focus on preventable or modifiable risk factors for disease (e.g., sedentary lifestyle, tobacco use). The new law also leverages a number of mechanisms to improve the quality of health care, including new requirements for quality measure development, collection, analysis, and public reporting; programs to develop and disseminate innovative strategies for improving the quality of health care delivery; and support for care coordination programs such as medical homes, patient navigators, and the co-location of primary health care and mental health services.Additionally, PPACA authorizes funding for programs to prevent elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation; grants to expand trauma care services and improve regional coordination of emergency services; anddemonstration projects to implement alternatives to current tort litigation for resolving medical malpractice claims, among other provisions.The new law also reauthorizes the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA), which sets out the national policy for Indian health care and authorizes programs and services provided by the Indian Health Service. © 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

In the United States, an estimated 26% of non-institutionalized adults experience behavioral health disorders in a given year; over the course of a lifetime, the estimate rises to 46%. One study estimated spending on behavioral health care in 2005 to be $135 billion, of which $40 billion was paid by the federal government (including $10 billion by Medicare) and $44 billion by state governments. Both higher and lower cost estimates have been found in other studies. Among U.S. adults suffering from a behavioral health disorder severe enough to interfere with major life activities in 2009, 40% received no treatment; despite spending on behavioral health care, cost remains the most common barrier to treatment reported by adults with unmet need. The federal government has a role in both the financing and delivery of behavioral health care services, as a payer, regulator, and provider, and as such, Congress may have an interest in behavioral health care broadly. This interest was reflected in the recently enacted health reform law (Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act [PPACA], P.L. 111-148, as amended). Although transforming the behavioral health care delivery system was not an explicit focus of the law, it includes sections that are expected to increase access to behavioral health services through changes to the financing and delivery of health care services. This report provides an overview of sections in the health reform law that are expected to affect the financing and delivery of behavioral health care services. Access to health care services is determined by multiple factors, including (among other things) financing arrangements and covered benefits. PPACA may increase access to behavioral health services by increasing the availability and affordability of financing arrangements; the law also contains sections that will affect both the coverage of behavioral health services, as well as the conditions under which those services are covered. In addition, PPACA contains sections that are likely to affect the way in which health care services are delivered, specifically through changes to the workforce, the safety net, and new care delivery models. The report concludes by presenting the relevant sections in a series of nine tables: (1) essential health benefits; (2) mental health parity; (3) private health insurance; (4) Medicare; (5) Medicaid; (6) safety net services; (7) workforce; (8) miscellaneous sections (e.g., sections on research, education, or community-based services, among others); and (9) relevant Indian Health Service (IHS) sections (in an appendix). © 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Prior to 1996, health insurance coverage for mental illness had historically been less generous than that for other physical illnesses. Mental health parity is a response to this disparity in insurance coverage, and generally refers to the concept that health insurance coverage for mental health services should be offered on par with covered medical and surgical benefits. Prior to enactment of the ACA, two major mental health parity laws had been passed at the federal level, and together created the federal mental health parity requirements. These two laws are the Mental Health Parity Act of 1996 (MHPA, P.L. 104-204), which requires parity in annual and aggregate lifetime limits, and the Paul Wellstone and Pete DomeniciMental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008 (MHPAEA, P.L. 110-343), which expands parity requirements to treatment limitations, financial requirements (e.g., co-payments), and in- and out-of-network covered benefits. Neither of these laws mandates the coverage of any specific mental health condition; rather, where an insurer chooses to cover both mental health and medical and surgical benefits, they are required to do so in compliance with these parity requirements. The ACA contains a number of provisions which, when considered together, achieve two key goals with respect to mental health parity: (1) they expand the reach of the applicability of the federal mental health parity requirements; and (2) they create a mandated benefit for the coverage of certain mental health and substance abuse disorder services (to be determined through rulemaking) in a number of specific financing arrangements. PPACA expands the reach of federal mental health parity requirements to three main types of health plans: qualified health plans as established by the ACA; Medicaid non-managed care benchmark and benchmark-equivalent plans; and plans offered through the individual market. The ACA did not alter the federal mental health parity requirements with respect to CHIP plans, but the application of the requirements to CHIP plans, as required in law prior to the ACA, is explained here in detail. This report also analyzes the impact of the ACA on the existing small employer exemption under federal mental health parity law. © 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved."

Depending on the pertinent clinical history provided by the ordering clinician, CDS systems can optimize imaging by educating providers on appropriate image order entry and by alerting providers to the results of prior, potentially relevant imaging procedures, thereby reducing redundant imaging. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) has expedited the adoption of computerized physician order entry and CDS systems in health care through the creation of financial incentives and penalties to promote the ""meaningful use"" of health IT. Meaningful use represents the latest logical next step in a long chain of legislation promoting the areas of appropriate imaging utilization, accurate reporting, and IT. It is uncertain if large-scale implementation of imaging CDS will lead to improved health care quality, as seen in smaller settings, or to improved patient outcomes. However, imaging CDS enables the correlation of existing imaging evidence with outcome measures, including morbidity, mortality, and short-term imaging-relevant management outcomes (eg, biopsy, chemotherapy). The purposes of this article are to review the legislative sequence relevant to imaging CDS and to give guidance to radiology practices focused on quality and financial performance improvement during this time of accelerating regulatory change. © 2012 American College of Radiology."

We looked at two measures that can indicate whether favorable selection is taking place-predicted spending on beneficiaries and mortality-and studied whether policies that Medicare implemented in the past decade succeeded in reducing favorable selection in Medicare Advantage. We found that these policies-an improved risk adjustment formula and a prohibition on monthly disenrollment by beneficiaries-largely succeeded. Differences in predicted spending between those switching from traditional Medicare to Medicare Advantage relative to those who remained in traditional Medicare markedly narrowed, as did adjusted mortality rates.

A review and assessment of this legislation at several levels (federal, state, state agency, local region, and individual business leaders) were undertaken. The results of this expanded analysis suggest strongly that members of the business community and their employees will benefit from the legislation early on (years 1-3) and then likely will be impacted adversely as the payment mechanisms driving the legislation are tightened by new federal regulations (year 4 onward). Businesses will likely be immediately impacted by the legislation, with small business owners being the prime beneficiaries of the new legislation owing to the availability of coverage to approximately 32million individuals who previously had no access to coverage. In that regard, the soon-to-be newlyinsured population also will be a prime beneficiary of the legislation as the limitations on chronic illnesses and other preexisting conditions will be reduced or eliminated by the legislation.

At the same time, Medicaid facilitates financial protection and care access among beneficiaries with diabetes. Low-income adults with diabetes who were uninsured used fewer services, spent more out of pocket, and reported worse access than did their peers who were covered by Medicaid.

It is affected not only by the specialty choices of young physicians but also by decisions of physicians to leave their practices. This study examines factors that may contribute to such decisions. We analyzed data from a 2009 Commonwealth Fund mail survey of American physicians in internal medicine, family or general practice, or pediatrics to examine characteristics associated with their plans to retire or leave their practice for other reasons in the next 5 years. Just over half (53%) of the physicians age 50 years or older and 30% of physicians between age 35 and 49 years may leave their practices for these reasons. Having such plans was associated with many factors, but the strongest predictor concerned problems regarding time spent coordinating care for their patients, possibly reflecting dissatisfaction with tasks that do not require medical expertise and are not generally paid for in fee-for-service medicine. Factors that predict plans to retire differ from those associated with plans to leave practices for other reasons.

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act places great emphasis on reducing preventable readmissions by building care systems that are patient-centered and that remove arbitrary silos of care. Hospitals that perform poorly on this measure will experience significant financial penalties beginning this fiscal year. In the short term, decreasing readmission rates will eliminate waste and enhance patient recovery from major illness. However the real vision is to ensure that vulnerable patients, particularly the chronically ill, benefit from coordinated, patient-centered systems that maintain functional independence, improve quality of life, and provide comfort without the trauma, expense, and displacement that unnecessary hospitalization often entails.

Methods: The Florida Agency for Health Care Administration ED data sets for ED outpatient visits and ED admissions for eye care were analyzed for type of insurance coverage and stratified according to age younger than 18 years and 18 years or older. Negative binomial regression models were used to measure the percentage of change in payer distribution for each 1-year increase in calendar year. Results: During the 5-year study period, commercial insurance was the most frequent payer of ED outpatient services (31.1%), followed by self-pay (26.2%) and Medicaid (22.0%). For persons younger than 18 years, Medicaid and self-payment made up 67.7% of principal payers.

In February 2008, Wisconsin expanded and reformed its Medicaid/CHIP program and, as part of program implementation, automatically enrolled a set of newly eligible parents and children. This process of ""auto-enrollment"" targeted newly eligible parents and older children whose children/siblings were already enrolled in the state's Medicaid/CHIP program. Auto-enrollment brought over 44,000 individuals into the program, representing more than 60% of all enrollees in the first month of the reformed program. Individuals who were auto-enrolled were modestly more likely to leave the program relative to other individuals who enrolled in February 2008, unless their incomes were high enough to be required to pay premiums; these auto-enrollees were much more likely to exit relative to other enrollees subject to premium payments. The higher exit rates exhibited by non-premium paying auto-enrollees were likely due to the fact that over 40% of auto-enrollees were covered by a private insurance policy in the month of their enrollment, compared to approximately 30% for regular enrollees. A national simulation of an auto-enrollment process similar to Wisconsin's, including the expansion of adult Medicaid eligibility to 133% of the federal poverty level under the ACA, suggests that 2.5 million of the 5.6 million newly eligible parents could be auto-enrolled, and approximately 25% of this population would be privately insured. These results suggest that auto-enrollment may be appropriate for other states, especially in their efforts to enroll eligible populations who are not subject to premium requirements."

Objective/Hypothesis: We used qualitative methods to explore the nuanced processes of obtaining access to specialty care for publicly and privately insured CSHCN. Methods: From May 2009 to February 2010, 30 in-depth qualitative interviews (60-90 minutes in length) were conducted with Englishspeaking family caregivers of CSHCN covered by public insurance (n 5 15), private insurance (n 5 6), or both (n 5 9) in Cook County, IL. We used purposive quota sampling techniques to recruit parents from a group of 102 respondents from a related telephone survey who agreed to follow-up contact. All audio transcriptions and field notes were entered into Atlas-Ti software and analyzed by the authors through a thematic coding scheme. Results: Respondents varied in their success in obtaining requested specialty care. Several themes emerged that shape access to specialty care for CSHCN in this study: marked differences based upon insurance type, the acuity of a child's health condition, and the presence of language and cultural barriers in scheduling and attending appointments. Conclusions: Qualitative interviews with families illuminated current perceptions of inequities in access to outpatient specialty care for CSHCN.

In 1997, Congress passed similar legislation waiving the deductible only for mammograms and Pap smears. The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of the deductible waiver on mammogram and Pap smear utilization rates. Methods: Using 1995-2003 Medicare claims from a sample of female, elderly Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries, two pre/post analyses were conducted comparing mammogram and Pap smear utilization rates before and after implementation of the deductible waiver. Receipt of screening mammograms and Pap smears served as the outcome measures, and two time measures, representing two post-test observation periods, were used to examine the short- and long-term impacts on utilization. Results: There was a 20 percent short-term and a 25 percent longer term increase in the probability of having had a mammogram in the four years following the 1997 deductible waiver. Beneficiaries were no more likely to receive a Pap smear following the deductible waiver. Conclusions: Elimination of cost sharing may be an effective strategy for increasing preventive service use, but the impact could depend on the characteristics of the procedure, its cost, and the disease and populations it targets. These historical findings suggest that, with implementation of Section 4104, the greatest increases in utilization will be seen for preventive services that screen for diseases with high incidence or prevalence rates that increase with age, that are expensive, and that are performed on a frequent basis."

Medicare Advantage plans have gained financially from this favorable risk selection since their payments have traditionally been adjusted only minimally for clinical characteristics of enrollees, causing overpayment for healthier enrollees and underpayment for sicker ones. As a result, a new risk-adjustment system was phased in from 2004 to 2007, and a lock-in provision instituted to limit midyear disenrollment by enrollees experiencing health declines whose exodus could benefit plans financially. To determine whether these reforms were associated with intended reductions in risk selection, we compared differences in self-reported health care use and health between Medicare Advantage and traditional Medicare beneficiaries before versus after these reforms were implemented. We similarly compared differences between those who switched into or out of Medicare Advantage and nonswitchers. Most differences in 2001-03 were substantially narrowed by 2006-07, suggesting reduced selection.

Acting independently, neither medical groups, hospitals nor health plans have the optimal mix of resources and incentives to significantly reduce costs. Payers have core assets such as marketing, claims data, claims processing, reimbursement systems and capital. It would be cost prohibitive for all but the largest providers to develop these capabilities in order to compete directly with insurers. Likewise, medical groups and hospitals are positioned to foster financial interdependence among providers and coordinate the continuum of patient illnesses and care settings. Payers and providers should commit to reasonable clinical and cost goals, and share resources to minimize expenses and financial risks. It is in the interest of payers to work closely with providers on risk-management strategies because insurers need synergy with ACOs to remain cost competitive. It is in the interest of ACOs to work collaboratively with payers early on to develop reasonable and effective performance benchmarks. Hence, it is essential to have payer interoperability and data sharing integrated in an ACO model."

Sebelius is a federal lawsuit in which Virginia has challenged President Obama's signature legislative initiative of health care reform. Virginia has sought declaratory and injunctive relief to vindicate a state statute declaring that no Virginia resident shall be required to buy health insurance. To defend this state law from the preemptive effect of federal law, Virginia has contended that the federal legislation's individual mandate to buy health insurance is unconstitutional. Virginia's lawsuit has been one of the most closely followed and politically salient federal cases in recent times. Yet the very features of the case that have contributed to its political salience also require its dismissal for lack of statutory subject matter jurisdiction. The Supreme Court has placed limits on statutory subject matter jurisdiction over declaratory judgment actions in which a state seeks a declaration that a state statute is not preempted by federal law-precisely the relief sought in Virginia v. Sebelius. These statutory limits are a sea wall; they keep out, on statutory grounds, some suits that should otherwise be kept out on Article III grounds. The statutory and constitutional limits on federal jurisdiction over suits like Virginia v. Sebelius insulate federal courts from the strong political forces surrounding lawsuits that follow from state statutes designed to create federal jurisdiction over constitutional challenges by states to federal law. This Article identifies previously neglected jurisdictional limits, shows why they demand dismissal of Virginia v. Sebelius, and explains why it is appropriate for federal courts to be closed to suits of this type."

METHODS: This study was a secondary data analysis of the 2003 National Survey of Children's Health. Data were available for 70 007 children without special health care needs. We operationalized the medical home according to the National Survey of Children's Health design. Logistic regression for complex sample surveys was used to model each outcome with the medical home, controlling for sociodemographic characteristics. RESULTS: Overall, 58.1% of children without special health care needs had a medical home. The medical home was significantly associated with increased preventive care visits (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 1.32 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.22-1.43]), decreased outpatient sick visits (aOR: 0.71 [95% CI: 0.66-0.76), and decreased emergency department sick visits (aOR: 0.70 [95% CI: 0.65-0.76]). It was associated with increased odds of ""excellent/very good"" child health according to parental assessment (aOR: 1.29 [95% CI: 1.15-1.45) and healthpromoting behaviors such as being read to daily (aOR: 1.46 [95% CI: 1.13-1.89]), reported helmet use (aOR: 1.18 [95% CI: 1.03-1.34]), and decreased screen time (aOR: 1.12 [95% CI: 1.02-1.22]). CONCLUSIONS: For children without special health care needs, the medical home is associated with improved health care utilization patterns, better parental assessment of child health, and increased adherence with health-promoting behaviors. These findings support the recommendations of the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Affordable Care Act to extend the medical home to all children.

The 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA, or Affordable Care Act) will close approximately half the existing coverage gap but will leave more than twenty million people still uninsured. Can anything be done for the remaining uninsured that will bring us, finally, to some acceptable form of universal coverage? In particular, can safety-net programs be structured in a way that provides access to care sufficiently to approximate the goals of universal coverage? To better understand this social policy landscape, this chapter undertakes a conceptual analysis of what exactly we mean by ""universal,"" ""coverage,"" and ""access."" Understanding the policy significance of these terms over a range of meanings might help crystallize social debate and reveal the most achievable path forward. Necessarily, this inquiry is heavily normative, or value laden, but it avoids being excessively philosophical or opinionated by rooting normative analysis in real-world systems that express and operationalize actual social values. Specifically, I gauge the adequacy of coverage or access according to existing insurance systems that are widely considered to be at least minimally acceptable. My normative task is to identify the low-water markings of adequacy, rather than aim for pure equality. Idealistic aims can be useful to motivate improvements, but rarely are they fully achievable. My aim is more modest: to identify the nearest finish line of what might constitute some acceptable form of universal access. If we as a society are about to run out of gas in the drive for a fair and just health care system, knowing the shortest distance to this goal might help us finally push past rather than stall short of the line. To identify norms for universality, we begin by looking abroad. Then returning to domestic soil, we explore whether acceptable coverage necessarily requires insurance, or instead whether coverage can be accomplished through direct-access safety-net systems. The chapter concludes with analysis of data measuring access to care in model safety-net programs. © 2012 by Rutgers, The State University. All rights reserved."

In the United States, an estimated 26% of non-institutionalized adults experience behavioral health disorders in a given year; over the course of a lifetime, the estimate rises to 46%. This book provides an overview of sections in the health reform law that are expected to affect the financing and delivery of behavioral health care services. Access to health care services is determined by multiple factors, including financing arrangements and covered benefits. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) may increase access to behavioral health services by increasing the availability and affordability of financing arrangements; the law also contains sections that will affect both the coverage of behavioral health services, as well as the conditions under which those services are covered. © 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The Crimson Care Collaborative (CCC) is a joint student-faculty initiative in post-health-care-reform Massachusetts that was started with the explicit goal of attracting medical students to primary care careers. It fills a niche for student-run clinics, providing evening access to primary care services for patients without a PCP and urgent care services for patients of a Massachusetts General Hospital-affiliated internal medicine clinic, with the aim of decreasing emergency department use in both groups. Unlike other student-run clinics, CCC is integrated into the mainstream health care structure of an existing primary care clinic and, because of universal health insurance coverage in Massachusetts, can bill for its services. In addition to the clinical services offered, the student-run research team evaluates the quality of care and the patients' experiences at the clinic. This article describes the creation and development of CCC, including a brief overview of clinic operations, social services, research, laboratory services, student and patient education programs, and finance. In the wake of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, CCC is an example of how students can aid the transition to universal health care in the United States and how medical schools can expose students early in their training to primary care and clinic operations."

It is clear in the legislation, and the corresponding proposals published by the secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services in late 2011, that the intent is to move from paying physicians for reporting to paying physicians for performance. The proposals, developed jointly with CMS, specify that the calculation of payments for performance will be a composite of quality and cost measures. The base year for determining performance benchmarks for the performance measures will be 2013, and the measures will be applied to physician payments on a limited basis beginning in 2015 and to all physician payments by 2017. The role of medical specialty boards, such as the ABR, in the development and deployment of measures is highlighted in this context. CMS's recent conversations with board representatives have indicated their view that the boards' measure development activities are key to increasing physician (especially specialist) participation in the Physician Quality Reporting System to 50% by 2015, from 20% to 30% today. The ABR will continue its past activities in this arena, working with the American Board of Medical Specialties, CMS, and specialty societies, so that ABR diplomates will be able to simultaneously complete their Maintenance of Certification requirements, satisfy the requirements for CMS incentives, and avoid penalties. © 2012 American College of Radiology."

In particular, radiology has been affected, notably first with the passage of the Deficit Reduction Act in 2005 and then with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in 2010. Health care reforms are not only driven by political agendas. This process is also a response to underlying social, economic, and technological realities. It is unlikely that reform efforts will just evaporate because of a single change in government or with a decision by the US Supreme Court. Regardless of who sits in the Oval Office and which party controls Congress, there are forces that will need to be addressed through policy changes in the coming years. The underlying drivers of health care reform are legion, but health care inflation, fiscal mismanagement by government, poor planning for demographic changes that affect entitlement programs, questions about the quality of health outcomes, and a desire for universal health care were all central factors in the reforms put forth since 2009. Radiologists should be preparing now for continued change in both the public and private sectors in health care for the foreseeable future. These changes are likely to have profound impacts on our profession. Radiologists and their groups should plan to pay greater attention to these events and should seek to have a much greater level of involvement in the political and social processes that lead to policy changes in health care. © 2012 American College of Radiology."

These institutions frequently offer outreach services to uninsured and Medicaid populations as well as an array of health and social services, either directly or through collaborative arrangements. Public hospitals and AMCs have faced many challenges over the years in maintaining their safety-net roles, especially given their need to balance these roles against others they have in the community, such as research, teaching, and patient care. However, many have demonstrated their resilience to these stresses. This chapter examines the historical context that has led public hospitals and AMCs to serve as an important component of the health safety net and how their role in the safety net has been shaped by the challenges they have faced. Drawing on interviews we undertook with key stakeholders of safety-net institutions, the chapter also explores how the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) will affect these institutions and their ongoing roles in the community, including how these institutions will likely build on their existing efforts to address future challenges.

This case study examines the model of care used by the largest such plan, Care Improvement Plus, and compares utilization rates among its diabetes patients with those of other beneficiaries enrolled in fee-forservice Medicare in the same five states. This special-needs plan emphasizes direct contacts with patients to help identify gaps in care and promote primary and preventive health care. The comparative analysis indicates that people with diabetes in the special-needs plan-particularly nonwhite beneficiaries-had lower rates of hospitalization and readmission than their peers in fee-for-service Medicare. For example, risk-adjusted hospital days per enrollee among special-needs plan participants were 19 percent lower than for fee-for-service Medicare enrollees (27 percent lower for nonwhite enrollees). Risk-adjusted physician office visits were 7 percent higher among C-SNP enrollees than among comparable fee-for-service enrollees (26 percent higher for nonwhite enrollees). Although this study does not include a cost analysis, we believe that savings from reduced hospitalizations are likely to more than offset the additional costs of enhanced primary care programs.

THCGME reporting requirements may also provide data on the impact of various educational innovations on career choice and clinical care as well as other information that could be useful in devising a more transparent and equitable system of support for GME.THCGME program advocates should, however, be cautious in applying any lessons learned to broader GME policy reform. Unlike the THCGME funding, Medicare GME payments are part of the Medicare entitlement, tied to provision of clinical services and financed outside the annual congressional appropriations process. Pressure on domestic discretionary spending makes substantially expanded appropriations for the THCGME program an unlikely path for widespread reform. Absent secure ""all-payer financinga"" of GME, residency program sponsors lack sufficient Medicare funds to cover all GME costs and must favor investments in specialties that meet local concerns, not long-term national workforce priorities. Nonetheless, the THCGME program provides an exciting opportunity to improve and to study primary care GME. Furthermore, the organizational infrastructures established, program leaders developed, data collected, and lessons learned from the program can inform more fundamental change in U.S. GME payment policy."

It provides payments to ambulatory care centers for both direct and indirect GME expenses, and mandates a level of reporting from recipients that is not required for Medicare GME support. This initial look at the 11 inaugural teaching health centers (THCs) shows that they are training primary care residents in relevant delivery models (e.g., interprofessional teams, patient-centered medical homes), developing educational initiatives that address primary care practice in underserved areas, and transforming organizational and funding structures to support community-based training. The THCs plan to evaluate and report resident performance, patient quality of care, and graduate outcomes. The work of the first THCs has implications for primary care training, the GME system, and future policies and legislation aimed at strengthening the health care workforce."

The ranks of CHCs have grown from 8 pilot health centers in 1965 to more than 1,100 health centers serving over 19 million Americans in 2012. The capacity of CHCs is limited by the availability of primary care clinicians (physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants) who are trained to work in these settings. Primary care residency program faculties have long recognized the value and importance of educating physicians in CHCs, but productivity pressures over the past decade forced the dissolution of many CHC-medical school and residency program partnerships. Advocacy and research conducted in the 1990s and 2000s laid the groundwork for the Teaching Health Center Graduate Medical Education (THCGME) program, funded under the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which enables funding for residency training to flow directly to CHCs. This new federal initiative aligns the graduate medical education (GME) mission of preparing competent professionals with the CHC mission of providing quality and comprehensive care; it also helps address health care reform and the need for more primary care clinicians.

While the present ubiquity of third-party payers in the form of health insurance or government programs spawns inefficiencies and perverse incentives that drive market forces to work against, rather than toward, maximum social welfare, the reform bill threatens to exacerbate the very inefficiencies it seeks to avoid. Rather than focusing on controlling medical cost inflation, the bill seeks to include high-risk groups that are normally priced out of the insurance market, thus placing more stress on the payment model. The individual mandate-making health insurance mandatory-ensures that the low-risk young and healthy demographic will bear the cost of this increased burden on the insurance system. This Note examines how the recent health reform bill proposes to restructure the insurance market itself and analyzes the inadequacies of the individual mandate. Further, it briefly explores the constitutional challenges to the mandate and discusses whether the health reform bill is salvageable in light of its deficiencies."

This chapter focuses on primary care SNOs such as federally qualified health centers (FQHC) (also known as community health centers, or CHC) and community-based organizations such as free clinics. Their ability to remain financially viable while maintaining their mission of providing health care to uninsured and underinsured populations (the target populations), depends on developing innovative and efficient health care delivery designs and strategies. Until now most SNOs have viewed themselves as mission-oriented; at best, attention to sound business practices has been a secondary consideration. But as financial pressures and growing unmet need threaten their survival, many SNOs have recognized the need to operate as small businesses with greater attention to efficiency (Jacobson et al. 2005). What they collectively lack, however, is the means to identify what those operational and organizational strategies should be and how they might be used. Despite their importance as providers of last resort for uninsured and underinsured populations, there is only limited empirical evidence about how SNOs are organized and how they deliver health care. Unlike the robust study of larger health care organizations, the thousands of clinics that comprise the health care safety net have not yet been studied thoroughly to determine which organizational structures would achieve the best outcomes and which practices would improve quality of care. One goal of this chapter is to stimulate rigorous health services research on SNOs. The chapter will broadly examine the current organizational models that SNOs are using and will assess whether the organizational and operational structures are adequate to meet the primary care needs of the target populations. These needs include acute care, triage, referrals to specialists, chronic care management, and access to pharmaceuticals. The questions to be addressed include the following: Are FQHCs, free clinics, or hybrids (clinics that take insurance but are also committed to serving those without insurance) capable of acting as medical homes? To what extent are connections to larger health care systems necessary to sustain SNOs? How will SNOs adapt to changes in target population groups (such as undocumented immigrants and newly unemployed individuals)? What types of administrative support systems are needed to sustain health care SNOs? What is the role of SNOs, especially free clinics, after health reform? How will the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the Affordable Care Act, or ACA) affect the models clinics use to provide primary care services? After a summary of the background and context, we provide a synthesis of the current literature on models of care in SNOs. We then present results of a qualitative research project that examines organizational and operational efficiencies in Michigan's SNOs. We conclude with policy recommendations, focusing on alternative organizational strategies that could best serve the target populations and ensure a sustainable health care safety net along with innovative policies that states can adopt. © 2012 by Rutgers, The State University.

Pain is strongly associated with significant personal and societal costs. A crucial element of any initiative on pain must focus on eliminating pain care disparities that are pervasive throughout the United States health care settings. Objectives. This report focuses on macro-level factors related to pain care disparities in the United States that may be amenable to policy interventions. Methods. We identify concrete opportunities for achieving equity in pain care, especially those occasioned by recent legislative changes in the United States health care system. An aggressive policy, advocacy, and research agenda is synthesized in five domains: 1) structural/system; 2) policy and advocacy; 3) workforce; 4) provider; and 5) research. Results. Inequities in pain care remain an important and neglected health policy concern. Many direct and indirect provisions within the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and other national initiatives that leverage on ACA offer opportunities to achieve equity in pain care. These include changes in insurance, in public, provider, and legislative education, in primary care and pain specialist training, improving workforce diversity, achieving uniformity in race/ethnicity data collection, emphasizing patient-centered outcomes research, and encouraging focus on pain care disparities within the comparative effectiveness research paradigm. Conclusions. Recent national legislative initiatives within ACA are expected to generate multilevel efforts that will impact the flow of funding to address the pervasive issue of disparities. It is an opportune time for the pain community to take a lead in implementing a concerted agenda on pain care disparities in order to leverage these national initiatives. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

Federal mental health parity law addresses the terms under which mental health and substance use disorder services are covered in comparison with medical and surgical services in those plans that choose to offer coverage of these services. Federal law requires parity in annual and aggregate lifetime limits, treatment limitations, financial requirements, and in- and out-of-network covered benefits. However, federal parity law does not mandate the coverage of mental health and substance use disorder services. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA, P.L. 111-148), as amended, contains provisions that address both the coverage of mental health and substance use disorder services and the terms under which these services are covered. Specifically, the ACA includes provisions that require (1) compliance with federal parity law by certain plans and (2) the coverage of mental health and substance use disorder services by certain plans. The ACA does not change the federal mental health requirements at all. However, it extends applicability of these requirements to three new plan types: (1) Qualified Health Plans (QHPs, offered through the state Exchanges); (2) plans offered through the individual market; and (3) Medicaid benchmark and benchmark equivalent plans that are not managed care plans. The ACA also requires certain plans to offer coverage of mental health and substance use disorder services, by requiring these plan types to cover the Essential Health Benefits (EHB), which are defined to include mental health and substance use disorder services. The ACA requires coverage of the EHB, and therefore at least some mental health and substance use disorder services, by the following plan types: (1) QHPs; (2) new plans offered through the individual or small group market; and (3) Medicaid benchmark and benchmark-equivalent plans. © 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

To improve the quality of care and reduce costs, more needs to be done, particularly by fostering the number of primary care physicians (PCPs) and other healthcare professionals in PCP offices, as well as adjusting payment methods that much more strongly support and reward the primary care and the patient-centered medical home (PCMH) models. An additional area where substantial improvements are needed involves inner-city, rural, and other underserved populations. Provider- and managed care-driven changes are taking place, but much more needs to be done, particularly as a result of the ACA-associated health insurance enrollment expansion. Innovation in payment for PCPs and PCMHs (and corresponding changes in care delivery and improvements in clinically significant outcomes) will be key factors toward the successful implementation of ACA changes. In addition, several examples are discussed, in which the flexibility of managed care and its results-driven orientation are crucial factors for success. Future initiatives that will likely be more challenging and will require significant government funding include the US underserved populations and incentives to encourage medical school students and residents to choose primary care as a specialty. Conclusion: More innovation, particularly related to realignment of financial incentives to strengthen primary care, is needed to meet America's growing healthcare quality and cost challenges. © 2010-2011 Engage Healthcare Communications, LLC."

About half of this cost arose from the deductions for charitable contributions with the other half from exemptions of earnings of nonprofits. In 2010, the deduction for charitable contributions results in an estimated $40 billion in federal revenue losses. On average, endowment investments in 2009 experienced losses, meaning that the federal government did not lose revenues from exempting asset returns from taxation. This report provides an overview of recent changes affecting taxexempt and charitable organizations, while also discussing issues that may be of legislative interest in the future. The Pension Protection Act (P.L. 109-280) included a number of restrictions related to charitable contributions as well as restrictions on tax-exempt organizations. These changes are briefly surveyed. In addition to changes regarding the treatment of charitable contributions and tax-exempt organizations that have been made in recent years, several issues may be considered in future legislation. A number of provisions related to charitable contributions were extended temporarily as part of the tax extenders in the Tax Relief, Unemployment Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-312). Most of the charitable extenders were contained in legislation first introduced in 2001. Some provisions were enacted temporarily in 2005; further provisions and extensions occurred in 2006, in the Pension Protection Act. These extenders include an individual retirement account (IRA) rollover, liberalized treatment of certain gifts of inventory and conservation property, and two more technical provisions. Limitations on itemized deductions have been proposed as part of the Fiscal Commission's recommendation. President Obama's FY2010 and FY2011 Budgets propose limiting itemized deductions, including charitable contributions, to 28%. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA; P.L. 111-148), in response to concerns regarding charity care and community benefits provided by tax-exempt hospitals, imposed new regulations. Other issues that may arise reflect concerns about donor-advised funds and supporting organizations (now under study at the Treasury Department) and educational institutions' endowments. For donor advised funds and supporting organizations, the Treasury Department is in the process of evaluating whether minimum distribution requirements should be imposed, alongside other new regulations. The decline in educational institutions' endowments have raised concerns that such declines may lead to tuition increases. New reporting requirements for small tax-exempt organizations, enacted under the Pension Protection Act (P.L. 109-280) may cause a number of noncompliant tax-exempt entities to lose their tax-exempt status. © 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Now that the U.S. Supreme Court has upheld the individual mandate and other key parts of the law-what must busy healthcare professionals, insurance industry professionals, business and HR managers, and policymakers do? First, read this book. It translates the law's complex language into terms that are easy to understand, explaining what the new law does, when its provisions take effect, and how to implement it. This brand-new second edition also updates all the provisions and explains the myriad ways the ACA is already being put into practice. Health Care Reform Simplified, Second Edition, outlines the financial impact of the law and how it affects businesses, insurers, hospitals and doctors, and state and local governments. Most important, this book gives consumers and employers critical information for making informed choices about new options for private and public health insurance coverage. It also describes how the law interacts with Medicare and Medicaid. Finally, it looks at the potential roadblocks-political, judicial, and economic-that may yet derail some of the provisions. But with more than half of the Act's provisions in force already, and the Supreme Court's landmark decision upholding the law, there is no time to lose in understanding how the legislation affects you whether you are a consumer or deliverer of health care in the U.S. This book: Explains health reform in easy-to-understand terms Shows how the law is playing out in the real world Explains the ways the law or parts of it yet may be repealed by the 2012 election and the implications for readers Provides HR professionals and managers options for covering employees while explaining costs and benefits Details the impact on medical professionals and insurers and steps they must take now to comply with the law Shows policymakers the way forward now that legal challenges have abated This edition, completely updated to incorporate the newest regulations and the practices that have been put into place in various states, will prove an indispensable guide for those implementing the law, as well as those receiving health care, in the coming years. © 2012 by Dave Parks.

Additionally, the threat of bioterrorism has caused some to consider the possibility of introducing vaccination programs to prevent an outbreak of serious illnesses. Programs like health care coverage and vaccinations have the potential to violate certain religious beliefs and therefore may conflict with the First Amendment. In the continuing debate over issues for which mandatory health care programs might be solutions, questions have been raised about the constitutional issues relating to exemptions for health care programs. For the purposes of this report, mandatory health care programs are those which require individuals to take some action relating to a health care policy objective. A variety of mandatory health care programs currently exists at the federal and state levels. Some programs are medical programs that require individuals to participate in a medical program, while some programs are financial programs that require individuals to pay for program costs. For example, all 50 states and the District of Columbia require children to be vaccinated for certain illnesses and diseases before entering school. At the federal level, the tax system requires individuals to pay taxes that fund Medicare to provide health care to elderly citizens. In some instances, mandatory health care programs include exemptions that allow qualified persons to opt out of the required action. Specifically, religious exemptions have been provided in a variety of mandatory health care programs, including state immunization laws and Medicare taxes. These religious exemptions permit individuals who object to the program based on religious beliefs to avoid compromising those beliefs. This report will discuss the legal issues that arise in the context of religious exemptions for mandatory health care programs. It will discuss constitutional and statutory provisions relating to religious protection and how such laws have been applied in the medical context. The report will also briefly address examples of health care programs that have included religious exemptions, including a discussion of the religious conscience exemption included in PPACA. It will analyze whether the U.S. Constitution requires religious exemptions for mandatory health care programs and whether, if not required, the Constitution allows religious exemptions for such programs. © 2012 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Focusing on just cost and quality unfortunately does not address other very important factors that impact on our health care delivery system. Availability of a well-trained workforce, maintaining the sophisticated medical/surgical education system, and ultimately access to quality care by the public are critical to maintaining and enhancing our health care delivery system. Unfortunately, all five of these components are under at risk. Thus, we have evolving the ultimate perfect storm affecting our health care delivery system. Although not ideal and given the uniqueness of our population and their expectations, our current delivery system is excellent compared to other countries. However, the cost of our current system is rising at an alarming rate. Currently, health care consumes 17% of our gross domestic product. If our system is not revised this will continue to rise and by 2025 it will consume 48%. The dilemma, given the current state of our overall economy and rising debt, is how to address this major problem. Unfortunately, the Affordable Care Act, which is now law, does not address most of the issues and the cost was initially grossly under estimated. Furthermore, the law does not address the issues of workforce, maintaining our medical education system or ultimately, access. A major revision of our system will be necessary to truly create a system that protects and enhances all five of the components of our health care delivery system. To effectively accomplish this will require addressing those issues that lead to wasteful spending and diversion of our health care dollars to profit instead of care. Improved and efficient delivery systems that reduce complications, reduction of duplication of tertiary and quaternary programs or services within the same markets (i.e. regionalization of care), health insurance reform, and tort reform collectively could save hundreds of billion dollars per year! These changes may not be easy to accomplish politically but will be essential to save what is likely the best health care system in the world. © 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

This has led to the introduction of incentives to promote healthy behaviors, often referred to as wellness programs. These programs take a myriad of forms from providing a gym at the workplace to subsidizing the co-pays of certain medications and linking health care benefits or discounts to certain healthy lifestyles. In Arkansas, for example, state employees who exercise more frequently or eat healthier foods can earn up to three extra days off from work each year. These healthy lifestyle programs can include requirements for no tobacco use as well as requirements for certain cholesterol, blood pressure, or body mass index (BMI) measurements. For example, Scotts Miracle-Gro, a lawn care company, announced a policy that any smoking by employees, whether on or off the job, would result in termination of employment. There is a wide variety of wellness programs, and the application of existing law to a particular program is highly fact specific. One of the key distinctions is whether the health insurance program is provided by an individual's employer or whether it is provided by another source such as Medicaid. An employer-provided wellness program raises potential discrimination issues, since, if the employer obtains information about a health condition, there could be impacts not only on the provision of insurance but also on employment. The health care reform law, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (PPACA, P.L. 111-148, as modified by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, P.L. 111-152), significantly reformed the private health insurance market and included provisions on the implementation of employer wellness programs. This report will examine the legal issues raised by wellness programs, including discussions of PPACA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) nondiscrimination rules, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA), other employment discrimination laws such as the Age Discrimination in Employment Act and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as well as Medicaid and applicable tax code provisions. © 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Experts estimate that when fully implemented in 2019 the ACA will increase coverage from about 83 percent to 94 percent of the total US population. This is a monumental achievement. As with all major leaps forward, this one comes with challenges because of who the law includes and excludes, the levels of subsidies that will be available, and the retention of multiple insurance markets that individuals must traverse as income, work, and family circumstances change. The first and perhaps most important limitation is that more than twenty million people-about 8 percent of the nonelderly population-will remain uninsured. Some will be excluded because they will be unable to satisfy the act's requirement of legal US status to receive premium subsidies or nonemergency Medicaid benefits, the two principal forms of direct federal aid under the law for low- and moderate-income populations. Others will be individuals for whom coverage will remain unaffordable, as defined by the law. Still others will be individuals who experience interruptions in coverage because of lapses in Medicaid or subsidy eligibility, as well as enrollment barriers that persist despite the relatively aggressive enrollment assistance efforts that the law requires. A second challenge arises from the fact that insurance coverage alone does not cure nonfinancial barriers to health care. Millions of Americans live in urban and rural communities officially designated as medically underserved because of a serious shortage of primary care providers coupled with lower population income. While the expansion of health insurance may ultimately attract more health care providers into these communities, medical practice remains challenging because underserved patients may be more clinically complex. Also, the proportion covered by subsidized insurance is far higher and thus provider compensation is lower. Resources ultimately may improve in these communities, but this shift inevitably will be slow to come, especially given the overall primary care shortage. A third challenge can be found in the nature of the health insurance coverage under health reform. The ACA's nondiscrimination provisions make coverage available to millions of people that insurers previously excluded because of preexisting conditions, and the ACA's elimination of lifetime and annual caps and coverage of ""essential health benefits"" promise to strengthen the scope of coverage available in the individual and small-group insurance markets. At the same time, to keep premiums affordable, the actuarial value of coverage for which the insurer is responsible will remain relatively low, leaving individuals with potentially significant cost-sharing exposure (deductibles, copayments, coinsurance) for covered benefits. In addition, the definition of essential health benefits excludes some items and services (such as vision and dental care for adults) or limits others to less than what some patients need (such as therapy interventions for a disabled child that exceed plan limits). Thus, even with cost-sharing assistance, financial exposure will remain significant for lower-income people covered through insurance exchanges. For these reasons, safety-net providers, programs, and systems will remain essential in a postreform world, for newly insured and uninsured alike (Hall 2011a, 2011b; Katz 2010). The safety net consists primarily of publicly funded and community-supported clinics as well as public hospitals and missiondriven nonprofit hospitals that take all patients regardless of ability to pay (Lewin and Altman 2000). From one perspective, insurance reform will be a boon for these organizations. Expansion of Medicaid and private insurance coverage will reduce the collective burden of uncompensated care by over half and will increase the revenues that safety-net organizations receive from well-insured patients. Also, the ACA contains large funding increases for community health centers. However, the ACA also reduces other safety-net investments, most notably, funding for hospitals that serve a disproportionate number of low-income persons. Furthermore, dependence on the health care safety net may increase for the remaining uninsured population as providers that previously might have provided uncompensated care seek out the newly insured. These policy realities mean that some safety net providers will continue to experience significant gaps in geographic availability, scope of services, and capacity as well as a perception that safety nets are no longer necessary components of the health care system, even as the need for safety net services continues to remain significant for those left out of insurance reforms as well as individual and families who continue to face barriers to health care because of geographic, language, and cultural barriers. This book arose from our collective interest in and concern about these competing forces. We aim to better understand what role various components of the safety net can and should have following health insurance reform, and what policies and resources are needed to best facilitate adaptation to these evolving roles. In this overview chapter, we first outline the changing composition of the uninsured and highlight key needs that safety net providers and institutions can help to meet for underserved populations in the reformed environment, regardless of insurance status. We then summarize how each chapter addresses its piece of the larger picture that is painted by this book as a whole. © 2012 by Rutgers, The State University. All rights reserved."

Now the FDA has published guidance documents on biosimilar product development, which has been described by Dr Janet Woodcock, MD, Director of the FDAs Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, as ""an innovative approach to supporting the development of biosimilars at every step of the process."" Nevertheless, these initial guidelines are rather general in nature, so the looming question remains as to what extent the US biosimilar pathway will represent a viable route to market.The pathway for resolution of inevitable patent disputes is long and torturous and it seems that it will inevitably result in delays and litigation; the impact and implications of this represents a key consideration in the choice of the regulatory pathway. Thus, if there are no benefits in terms of reduced data requirement, a more rapid route to market and benefits to market access with the biosimilar route, then one really would have to question the value of this route.As far as whether the biosimilar pathway will offer reduced data requirements, the jury is still out. Initial indications suggest that the FDA review divisions might initially take a more conservative stand, but one might expect that, as policy becomes more transparent and with the publication of the guidelines, a more pragmatic position might emerge.One of the most controversial concepts raised by the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCI) is that of interchangeability between the innovator and the biosimilar product. This presents a very high bar and in many instances may simply not be achievable or financially viable. Yet, without interchangeable status, a biosimilar will be no different to any other biological approved through a standalone route and, inevitably, an extensive marketing effort would be required to achieve any meaningful market penetration. On the other hand, a standalone application may not offer a viable alternative either, as this would require a more conventional and graduated development programme with the need for extensive non-clinical and phase II data. Furthermore, the inability to extrapolate between indications would require large comparative trials for each indication.Biosimilars are an essential and inevitable part of enhancing patient access to life-saving medications, and if nations want to maximize the value of healthcare spend, bringing health and well-being to their citizens, biosimilars are a necessity and their exclusion an unaffordable luxury. Thus, one would anticipate that, inevitably, despite the debate, the BPCI will spawn an attractive US biosimilar approval pathway. Certainly, there are many sponsors of biosimilar products banking on just that and the recently published guidelines suggest that the FDA will ultimately apply sound scientific principles, which is, undoubtedly, the optimal way forward. © 2012 Springer International Publishing AG.

Lack of access is not simply a matter of insurance status; the difficulty of finding a primary care provider is a massive barrier to the use of primary care. Traditionally, charity care for the medically indigent has existed outside of government channels. From the early 1900s, local and county governments experimented with funding, coordinating, and even providing ambulatory care; none of these efforts survived attacks by local physicians. But beginning in the mid-1960s the federal government began funding a new mode of primary care delivery: community health centers. Community health centers are not-for-profit entities serving residents of areas designated by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) as ""medically underserved."" Subsisting on third-party reimbursements (mainly Medicaid), competitive federal grants and loan guarantees awarded by the HHS, and some state and local governmental support and philanthropic funding, they provide comprehensive ambulatory care, either free or on a sliding scale. Centers also offer different mixes of ""enabling"" services, from case management and transportation to and from the facility, to translation services, and to substance abuse programs, immunizations, and screenings. In addition, all centers regularly assess community health problems and conduct health education and outreach programming; some target specific populations, such as migrant workers, public housing residents, homeless individuals, and elementary and secondary school children. Today, more than 1,100 centers provide what is considered cost-effective and high-quality care to more than twenty million Americans at more than 7,900 delivery sites. Health centers improve access and use for the underserved, and reduce ethnic and racial disparities in health outcomes. About one-third of their patients are Hispanic (most of whom rely on bilingual staff), and another quarter are African American. Seventy percent of patients are poor. Fully 60 percent of users have some form of health insurance. The health centers program constitutes the country's largest primary care system. With annual expenditures of more than $7 billion (not including additional funding through FY 2015 provided through the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 [Affordable Care Act, or ACA]), community health centers now occupy a central role in America's safety net of health care provision. Combining primary care with some public health functions-a departure from the traditional bifurcation of medical care from public health-health centers also feature a quite radical governance structure begun during the program's origins during the War on Poverty: a majority of each center's governing board must consist of active patients residing nearby (Brandt and Gardner 2000). Excluding state and local sources, patient payments, and third-party reimbursements, HHS spends more than $2 billion per year on the program (figure 2.1). Relying more than other health facilities on nurse practitioners, physicians' assistants, and other non-MD health professionals, health centers are also heavily dependent on the National Health Service Corps and other federal medical workforce programs. Just over one-half of health centers are in rural areas while just over one-half of all patients reside in urban areas. Health centers exist in every state, in more than 90 percent of congressional districts, but in only about one-quarter of those areas designated by HHS as medically underserved (Iglehart 2010, 343). The program is managed by HHS's wellregarded Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), and for more than three decades a highly effective national lobby and its state affiliates have played a critical role in the program's survival and its recent, strange expansion. Begun as a demonstration project during the War on Poverty, the program has until recently remained in the shadows of the health care system. Uncontroversial and of low salience to members of Congress, it muddled through for three decades. Targeted by Republican administrations and conservatives for reduction or elimination through budget cuts or conversion into block grants, it survived but never experienced the massive expansion for which its proponents long hoped. The Clinton administration was also strangely uninterested in it, and it grew during the 1990s only due to the initiative of a bipartisan coalition in Congress and improved financing arrangements. In the past decade, a massive expansion has occurred, but under the unlikely stewardship of the George W. Bush administration. While many other programs for the poor or medically underserved were slashed or eliminated during the Bush years, the number of delivery sites has tripled since 2000 and the number of patients served has more than doubled. Plans folded into the ACA are even bolder; funding commitments call again for these centers to double their patients served to forty million by 2015, or fully two-thirds of America's medically underserved (Ku et al. 2010). This bizarre trajectory, I argue, cannot be explained simply by shifts in party control of Congress or the White House, ideological trends, or the vagaries of distributive politics. Rather, the ebbs and flows of this program are best understood as the product of political learning. I argue that Democrats and Republicans learned lessons during the long battle over national health insurance (NHI), that they adapted their positions on health policies in light of these lessons, and that these adaptations help explain the trajectory of the health centers program. Beginning in the 1970s Republicans came to see the health centers program, and particularly its national expansion, as part of a strategy to facilitate Democratic proposals for universal coverage. NHI proponents would, Republicans feared, be able to point to the existence of a network of facilities for the poor already in place, thus reducing some of the practical difficulties of creating a workable system. Republican attempts to eliminate the program are best viewed in the context of their efforts to tear down the welfare state through a frontal assault. Meanwhile, by the 1990s many progressives devoted to the attainment of universal health coverage had developed a strange ambivalence toward programs for the underserved. They came to see them, in Leninist ""one step forward"" fashion, as weakening pressures for systemic reform of the health care system. Over time, conservatives came to agree with them. This chapter explains the Bush administration's embrace of the program as an adaptation to conservatives' earlier failures to retrench the US welfare state head on, and as part of a renewed effort by conservatives to ""limit-or, more often, refocus and redirect-activist government."" The Bush health centers expansion was consistent with other federal interventions into health care, education, and pensions. These interventions, while angering many fiscal conservatives, grow out of their adaptation to lessons learned: a longer-term strategy to build some government programs in order to shrink other larger programs (Pierson and Skocpol 2007, 3; Glenn and Teles 2009). Bush's health centers initiative reflected this new understanding as well as lessons that Karl Rove and others learned about the electoral consequences of their party's vilification during budget battles with President Bill Clinton in the mid-1990s. The response to this second set of lessons helped produce ""compassionate conservatism."" Thus, the early conservative attack, many progressives' puzzling ambivalence toward health centers, and the subsequent conservative embrace are, I argue, explicable in terms of learning and adaptation. I describe the origins and development of the health centers program amidst the War on Poverty, and I chart how the program muddled through from the Nixon years until 2001. Of particular importance here is the ambivalence shown toward the program by the Clinton administration. I offer an explanation of the puzzling Bush health centers initiative. The chapter closes by discussing some challenges facing the program in the aftermath of the landmark ACA.2. © 2012 by Rutgers, The State University. All rights reserved."

Unlike Medicare and Medicaid, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) does not merely fill the chasms created by voluntary health insurance.1 Instead, it tackles the fundamental problems that arise in a system that gives healthy individuals the freedom to opt out, bars coverage for the sick, and allows private insurers to select the healthiest customers and then walk away when the tide turns. The ACA addresses these problems by creating a five-pillar approach to health reform. First, as of January 1, 2014, the law eliminates health insurers' ability to choose only the healthiest risks by barring various types of discriminatory practices including, among others, rescissions of coverage, discrimination based on health status, and application of preexisting condition exclusions.2 Second, by requiring virtually all individuals who can afford to do so to obtain coverage, the law creates the national pool of healthy lives essential to any viable, stable approach to universal coverage.3 Third, to ensure that coverage is affordable, the legislation creates a system of refundable tax credits and cost-sharing subsidies.4 Fourth, the legislation creates a more robust individual and small-group market for health insurance coverage through the establishment of state health insurance exchanges.5 Finally, the law restructures Medicaid to ensure coverage of the poorest individuals. But even as the ACA establishes a new foundational base for health insurance, it pretty much leaves untouched the organization and practice of health care. Important pilot efforts are authorized that aim to use Medicare and (at state option) Medicaid to incentivize greater quality and efficiency among health care providers.7 But these pilots do not alter providers' freedoms to select the patients they wish to treat, practice in what they perceive to be desirable locations, reject patients considered too difficult to manage, or specialize in accordance with the practice area of their own choosing. Nothing in the law compels physicians-the gateway into the health care system-to locate in poor communities, to accept Medicaid beneficiaries or uninsured people, to learn to speak multiple languages, or to become skilled in caring for patients whose health burdens extend far beyond a relatively simple set of presenting clinical symptoms. By contrast, adaptation of health care to medically underserved communities and populations is the hallmark of the health center program. The ACA makes a number of major investments in community health centers. A primary purpose of these investments is to address the chronic shortage of health care professionals to serve the low-income and medically underserved populations who are the principal beneficiaries of health reform. An additional purpose is to prepare for the surge in health care use that can be expected to flow from a major expansion of insurance (Kessler 2009) to thirtytwo million persons, including the sixteen million mostly adult poor people who will gain Medicaid eligibility.9 The aim of these reforms is to more than double the size of the program by 2019, growing health centers from the twenty million patients served in 2009 (NACHC 2009) into a health care gateway for some fifty million medically underserved children and adults by 2019 (Rosenbaum, Jones, and Shin 2010). Most of these patients will be insured, but more than one in five is projected to remain without health insurance as a result of gaps in coverage, the lack of affordable options, or legal status (ibid.). This is to be expected, of course, given the mission of health centers. How health centers respond to this updated mission and the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead are the focus of this chapter. The chapter begins with an overview of the health centers program and its key characteristics. It then describes the major elements of the law that will help shape their ability to achieve this expanded gateway mission. It also discusses broader currents moving through the health care system as a whole-including the pressures toward clinical and financial integration-that ultimately will bear directly on health centers' success in opening a window onto the entire health care system for their patients. © 2012 by Rutgers, The State University.

In addition to providing inpatient services, their emergency rooms deliver vast amounts of ambulatory care to low-income Americans. Not all hospitals are, of course, equal in this regard. Of the more than 5,700 hospitals in the United States, a much smaller number have been front and center in caring for the disadvantaged. These so-called safety-net hospitals face chronic fiscal stress brought on by serving large numbers of uninsured. Three decades ago, federal policymakers responded to this problem by taking steps to shore up funding for these institutions. Specifically, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 authorized state Medicaid programs to take into account the fiscal plight of hospitals that treat greater percentages of low-income individuals who are uninsured or enrolled in Medicaid. The legislation authorized states to provide disproportionate share hospital (DSH) payments to these institutions. Through different mechanisms, Congress also required Medicare to allocate DSH funds. The landmark health care reform of March 2010 promises to reshape and curtail Medicaid DSH. In crafting the DSH portions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), two general perspectives animated federal policymakers. First, they fathomed that the states had historically used DSH as a platform for creative financing schemes to shift costs from themselves to the federal government. A highly technical intergovernmental politics of accounting had grown up around DSH, which left many federal officials with a jaundiced view of state behavior. Second, federal officials reasoned that the expansion of insurance coverage meant that safety-net hospitals would provide less charity care and that DSH would become less central to their fiscal solvency. Hence, the ACA calls for $18 billion in Medicaid DSH cuts through 2020.1 It also pares Medicare DSH payments by $22 billion. The ACA left many safety-net hospitals concerned about their future. During the health care debate in 2009, their advocates warned against the cuts in Medicaid DSH that the White House had negotiated with the American Hospital Association. While safety-net providers generally supported health care reform, they feared that reductions in DSH payments would erode their viability. The implications of the DSH modifications for the safety net will largely depend on the politics that unfolds over the next several years. The issue here involves the durability of the health reform legislation. Will the new law unleash positive feedback that entrenches it in the American health insurance regime? Or will subsequent elections and related political eddies create circumstances where federal policymakers repeal or otherwise vitiate it (Patashnik 2008)? If so, will the Medicaid provisions in general and its DSH components in particular survive? Beyond these large political questions, the unfolding story of DSH and the safety net will hinge substantially on the politics of the budgetary process and policy implementation. If safety-net hospitals face mounting fiscal woes, they may well strive to derail the DSH cuts envisioned in the new law. However, any such effort will unfold in a very difficult fiscal environment. With the federal deficit and debt exploding, the call for entitlement reform and further cuts may well gain steam. Beyond the budget process, discretion wielded during implementation by the federal and state governments will markedly shape which safety-net institutions get what, when, and how from DSH and Medicaid more generally. Executive branch politics will be pivotal. We possess no crystal ball that enables us to predict DSH policy developments. But we can provide the provenance for insight by assessing the evolution of Medicaid DSH policy over nearly three decades as well as the challenges presented by health reform. This chapter opens with a review of DSH's transformation since its birth in 1981. The first decade of the initiative proved pivotal in forging a template for the program that became very difficult to revamp. DSH provides a particularly vivid example of what social scientists call path dependence. The chapter then turns to the issue of targeting- whether DSH monies flow to the most essential safety-net hospitals in greatest fiscal need. It opens by examining the variation in DSH spending among the states; it then considers targeting within their boundaries. We briefly compare the level of targeting achieved by Medicaid DSH to that fostered by Medicare. Having assessed the evolution of Medicaid DSH through the G. W. Bush administration, we turn to developments during the Obama years. Concerns about DSH voiced by key stakeholders in the processes leading to the passage of the ACA come under the microscope, as do pertinent provisions of the new law. We then assess four challenges that Medicaid DSH will pose for federal and state officials as implementation unfolds-challenges related to coverage, provider payment rates, targeting, and information. We conclude by suggesting means for casting additional light on Medicaid's contribution to the safety net. © 2012 by Rutgers, The State University. All rights reserved."
2012,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84889082306&partnerID=40&md5=e64737fe919c04bdd1d04afdae0f241b","A lengthy debate over how to build a more effective and affordable health care system culminated in the enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA). The legislation is neither the beginning nor the end of efforts to improve health care and health outcomes in the United States. Many more steps, both large and small, will be needed to establish a stable, highperforming health care system. Among its many provisions, the ACA sets in motion an unprecedented expansion of health insurance coverage, projected to reach more than thirty million previously uninsured Americans. Over the next few years, a crucial test of health care reform will be whether the expansion of coverage is converted into a guarantee of cost-effective access to needed services. At the same time, expectations for better care will be raised for close to twenty million people who remain uninsured. Both the short-term and long-term success of health care reform will depend on the availability of high-quality primary care. It seems clear that the capacity and cost-effectiveness of the nation's health care safety net, especially its community health centers (CHC), will be important determinants of how well the primary care needs of newly insured individuals and still-uninsured individuals are met as national health care reform proceeds (Adashi, Geiger, and Fine 2010). As chapter 3 of this volume explains, the ACA and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) include a number of incremental steps to strengthen CHCs, including funds to acquire new health information technology, support construction and expansion of centers, and support new clinical positions through the National Health Service Corps (NHSC). While these are all necessary steps, an additional innovation could produce a catalytic effect and yield broad, lasting health system improvement. We propose an expansion of partnerships between the nation's CHCs and the nation's academic medical centers. The innovation we propose-the Community Health Center and Academic Medical Partnership (CHAMP)- would build upon current collaboration in the areas of patient care, health professions education, and community health services research (Morris et al. 2008; Brutger 2010). This chapter explains how CHAMP would expand graduate medical education and ambulatory-training opportunities for primary care residents in CHCs designated as ""teaching health centers."" Such a partnership would improve the quality of primary care training and at the same time help CHCs meet the increasing demand for their services (Rieselbach, Crouse, and Frohna 2010). This initiative would help provide more affordable care and better outcomes for many of the people who will acquire health insurance as of 2014 and who are likely to be cared for by CHCs. A major expansion of these collaborative relationships is now possible. Enactment of the ACA, with its support for primary care and teaching health centers, provides the initial basis for CHAMP to further establish CHCs as a key component of a reformed, cost-effective health care system. Primary care residents would receive their final year of training in these centers, followed by the incentive of NHSC debt repayment for subsequent practice in an underserved area. Residents trained in this setting would immediately increase the clinical capacity of CHCs and ultimately expand the primary care physician workforce. We believe that this new visible commitment of our academic institutions to community health improvement may well inspire a new generation of medical students to consider primary care as a career choice. This partnership should be an integral part of a strategy to provide the number of well-trained and highly motivated clinicians needed to ensure a strong future for primary care across the US health care system. It would also respond to the recent call by a consortium of academic medical centers for leadership and cooperation with other sectors to address the social determinants of health and reduce disparities across population groups (Blue Ridge Academic Health Group 2010). This chapter develops the case for CHAMP first by outlining the problems in health care delivery this proposal would address and then by describing a variety of past and present initiatives intended to strengthen the link between primary care training and safety net providers. After specifying the key features of CHAMP, we discuss how this proposal meshes with various provisions in the ACA that encourage such initiatives and identify areas in which further steps in policy and implementation will be required for broad development of this form of community-academic partnership. © 2012 by Rutgers, The State University.
