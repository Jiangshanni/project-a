A key element in this role is the development of collaborative working relationships (CWRs) among physicians and other prescribers, which is a difficult, but ultimately rewarding process, with the pharmacist taking the lead to drive the establishment of mutual trust and professional respect. This article presents the CWR model, beginning with the baseline stage of professional awareness that represents a typical starting point, and progressing through 4 subsequent stages of increasingly close collaboration: professional recognition, exploration and trial, professional relationship expansion, and commitment to the CWR. The challenges and strategies for success at each stage are discussed, providing a road map for the pharmacist to proactively seek and gradually develop successful, lasting, collaborative relationships with prescribers. Reimbursement strategies for medication therapy management (MTM) and collaborative practice services must be carefully designed to ensure that the extra time and expense of initiating such services is more than offset by their profitability in the long term. Because each state has its own rules covering collaborative practice services, pharmacists must take care to familiarize themselves with the regulations in their own states. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act has formally recognized the value of MTM services and specifically identified pharmacists as providers of reimbursable MTM services to targeted beneficiaries."

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 mandates that calorie labels be added to menu boards of chain restaurants with 20 or more locations. This systematic review includes seven studies published since the last review on the topic in 2008. Authors searched for peer-reviewed studies using PUBMED and Google Scholar. Included studies used an experimental or quasi-experimental design comparing a calorie-labeled menu with a no-calorie menu and were conducted in laboratories, college cafeterias, and fast food restaurants. Two of the included studies were judged to be of good quality, and five of were judged to be of fair quality. Observational studies conducted in cities after implementation of calorie labeling were imprecise in their measure of the isolated effects of calorie labels. Experimental studies conducted in laboratory settings were difficult to generalize to real world behavior. Only two of the seven studies reported a statistically significant reduction in calories purchased among consumers using calorie-labeled menus. The current evidence suggests that calorie labeling does not have the intended effect of decreasing calorie purchasing or consumption. © 2011 Swartz et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd."

PPACA includes strategies to make the American healthcare sector more efficient and effective. PPACA's comparative effectiveness research initiative and the establishment of the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute are major strategies in this regard. PPACA's comparative effectiveness research initiative is one in a long line of federal initiatives to address the rising costs of healthcare as well as to obtain better value for healthcare expenditures. The key question is whether the governance and design features of the institute that will oversee the initiative will enable it to succeed where other federal efforts have faltered. This Article analyzes the federal government's quest to ensure value for money expended in publically funded healthcare programs and the health sector generally. This Article will also analyze what factors contribute to the possible success or failure of the comparative effectiveness research initiative. Success can be defined as the use of the findings of comparative effectiveness to make medical practice less costly, more efficient and effective, and ultimately, to bend the cost curve."

Most publicly released polls on the law have focused on the views of Americans as a whole. But with much of the responsibility of implementation lying with the states, this essay explores whether opinion differs geographically. The analysis finds that views on the health reform law do differ by region, and these differences are most likely driven by the political leanings of a given area. While opinion nationally differs by age and race, this pattern does not hold when looking by region. Areas that have a larger share of uninsured and are slated to receive greater federal funding under the ACA also do not differ in their opinions. These data suggest that regional variations in attitudes about the ACA are based less on the demographic structure of a region and more on the political ideologies of residents in a given region. As implementation of the law continues, this analysis shows that national opinion data mask important regional variations in views of the ACA. © 2011 by Duke University Press."

Methods: ACOs represent a new health care delivery and provider payment system designed to improve clinical quality and control costs. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) makes contracts with ACOs a permanent option under Medicare. This article explores ACA implications, using the literature to describe successful integrated health care organizations that will likely become the first ACOs. Previous research studying rural managed care organizations found rural success stories that can inform the ACO discussion. Findings: Preconditions for success as ACOs include enrolling a minimum number of patients to manage financial risk and implementing medical care policies and programs to improve quality. Rural managed care organizations succeeded because of care management experience, nonprofit status, and strong local leadership focused on improving the health of the population served. Conclusions: Rural provider participation in ACOs will require collaboration among rural providers and with larger, often urban, health care systems. Rural providers should strengthen their negotiation capacities by developing rural provider networks, understanding large health system motivations, and adopting best practices in clinical management. Rural communities should generate programs that motivate their populations to achieve and maintain optimum health status. Policy makers should develop rural-relevant ACO-performance measures and provide necessary technical assistance to rural providers and organizations. © 2010 National Rural Health Association."

On March 30, 2010, PPACA was amended by P.L. 111-152, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. This chapter summarizes the key provisions in PPACA (hereafter referring to PPACA as amended by P.L. 111-152) that affect private health insurance. PPACA imposes new requirements on individuals, employers, and health plans; restructures the private health insurance market; sets minimum standards for health coverage; and provides financial assistance to certain individuals and, in some cases, small employers. In general, PPACA requires individuals, beginning in 2014, to maintain health insurance, with some exceptions. Individuals will be required to maintain minimum essential coverage, which includes eligible employer coverage, individual coverage, grandfathered plans, and federal programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, among others. Employers are not explicitly required to provide health benefits, although certain employers with more than 50 employees may be required to pay a penalty if either (1) they do not provide insurance, under certain circumstances, or (2) the insurance they provide does not meet specified requirements. Several insurance market reforms will be implemented, including some prior to full implementation in 2014, such as prohibition against lifetime benefit limits and coverage for preexisting health conditions for children. In addition to establishing new federal private health insurance standards, PPACA will enable and support states' creation by 2014 of ""American Health Benefit Exchanges."" An exchange cannot be an insurer, but will provide eligible individuals and small businesses with access to insurers' plans in a comparable way. The exchange will consist of a selection of private plans as well as ""multi-state qualified health plans,"" administered by the Office of Personnel Management. Individuals will only be eligible to enroll in an exchange plan if they are not enrolled in Medicare, Medicaid, or acceptable employer coverage as a full-time employee. Based on income, certain individuals may qualify for a tax credit toward their premium costs and a subsidy for their cost- sharing; the credits and subsidies will be available only through an exchange. States will have the flexibility to establish basic health plans for low-income individuals not eligible for Medicaid. Individual and small group coverage will be allowed to be offered through nonprofit, member-run health insurance companies. Such nonprofit insurers will be eligible for grants and loans distributed through the new Consumer Operated and Oriented Plan (CO-OP) program. © 2011 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

PPACA will, among other changes, modify Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) statutes. In addition, on March 21, 2010, the House passed an amendment in the nature of a substitute to H.R. 4872, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (HCERA, P.L. 111-152).

HCERA includes the following two titles: (1) Coverage, Medicare, Medicaid, and Revenues, and (2) Education and Health. Title I contains provisions related to health care and revenues, including modifications made by HCERA to PPACA. Title II includes amendments to the Higher Education Act of 1965, which authorizes most of the federal programs involving postsecondary education, and other health amendments, which include other changes to PPACA.

This report reflects legislative language in HCERA as passed by the House on March 25, 2010. Selected highlights of the Medicaid and CHIP amendments made by HCERA to PPACA include the following: • primary care physician payment rates for selected patient treatments were increased; • the definition of the average manufacturer price (AMP) was revised to help make AMP more closely reflect manufacturers' average prices; • the effective date of the Community First Choice Option was delayed; • state FMAP rates for newly eligible populations were changed, as were income counting rules for certain populations; • the territories' spending rate caps were increased beginning with the second quarter of FY2011; • additional program integrity funding was provided through indexing of the Medicaid Integrity Program for fiscal years beginning with FY2010; and • Medicaid Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) payment reductions were modified. © 2011 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The new law will, among other things, reauthorize the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA). In addition, it makes several changes related to American Indians and Alaska Natives enrolled in and receiving services from the Medicare, Medicaid, and Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP)-also called Social Security Act (SSA) health benefit programs. IHCIA authorizes many programs and services provided by the Indian Health Service (IHS), it sets out the national policy for health services administered to Indians, and it states the federal goal to ensure the highest possible health status for Indians, including urban Indians. In addition, it authorizes direct collections from Medicare, Medicaid, and other third-party insurers. This chapter, one of a series of CRS products on PPACA, summarizes some of the key changes made in the reauthorization of IHCIA. In addition, the report summarizes the provisions related to American Indians and Alaska Natives enrolled in and receiving services from SSA health benefit programs. PPACA will extend the authorizations of appropriations for IHCIA programs indefinitely. It will also permit tribal organizations (TOs) and urban Indian organizations (UIOs) to apply for contract and grant programs for which they were not previously eligible. The law also expands the mental health services authorized under IHCIA to create comprehensive behavioral health and treatment programs. In addition, it requires IHS to establish new programs related to youth suicide prevention and requires demonstration projects to construct modular and mobile health facilities in order to expand health services available through IHS, Indian Tribes (ITs), and TOs. With regard to SSA health benefit programs, PPACA permits specified Indian entities to determine Medicaid and CHIP eligibility and extends the period during which IHS, IT, and TO services are reimbursed for all Medicare Part B services, indefinitely, beginning January 1, 2010. Under current law, authority for these facilities to receive Medicare Part B reimbursements for certain specified services expired on January 1, 2010. PPACA also makes several organizational changes to IHS. IHS is required to establish an Office of Direct Service Tribes to serve tribes that receive their health care and other services directly from IHS as opposed to receiving services through IHS-funded facilities or programs operated by ITs or TOs. In addition, the bill requires a plan to establish a new area office to serve tribes in Nevada and a new IHS Director of HIV/AIDS Prevention and Treatment. © 2011 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

However, these programs are limited in scope and continue to face increased financial pressures. Although private LTC insurance is available to provide some financial protection against an individual's risk of the potentially high cost of LTC, fewer than 10% of individuals aged 50 and older own such a policy. Thus, for the majority of older Americans, the out-of-pocket cost of obtaining paid help for these services may far exceed their financial resources. To address gaps in LTC coverage and assist individuals and families in paying for such services, the recently enacted Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA; P.L. 111-148) establishes a federally administered voluntary LTC insurance program entitled the Community Living Assistance Services and Supports (CLASS) program. PPACA creates a new Title XXXII of the Public Health Service Act (PHSA) titled Community Living Assistance Services and Supports. Once established, employed individuals aged 18 and older can voluntarily enroll in the CLASS program. PPACA specifies two processes for enrollment into the CLASS program. The first is an automatic enrollment process. This is a voluntary program and employers would have the option of participating. Within the automatic enrollment process, employers who choose to participate would be responsible for withholding CLASS premiums through payroll deductions. Employees would then have the opportunity to ""opt-out"" if they do not want to participate. These enrollment procedures for employers in the CLASS program are intended to be similar to those currently established for 40 1(k) and other similar retirement plans by the Internal Revenue Service. An alternative enrollment process would also be developed for self-employed individuals, those with more than one employer, and those who have an employer that does not elect to participate in the automatic enrollment process. Premiums for the CLASS program are to be determined by the Secretary based on 75-year actuarial estimates of expected future use and expenditures. Premiums would vary by age at enrollment. PPACA also includes premium subsidies for workers with incomes below the federal poverty level and full-time students aged 18 to 21 who currently are working. To be eligible to receive benefits an individual must be an active enrollee who meets the five-year vesting and minimum earnings requirements. In addition, an eligible individual must have a functional limitation, as certified by a licensed health care practitioner, that is expected to last for 90 days. Benefits to eligible recipients include a cash benefit of at least an average of $50 a day (based on the reasonably expected distribution of beneficiaries receiving benefits at various levels). Other benefits include advocacy services, and advice and assistance counseling on accessing and coordinating LTC services. This chapter first discusses the cost and financing for LTC services as well as the current market for private LTC insurance. It then details those CLASS program requirements for enrollment, premiums, eligibility, benefits, administration and oversight as specified in PPACA. This chapter then discusses the federal budget implications of the CLASS program, as estimated by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). Finally, the report provides a timeline of CLASS program provisions enacted under PPACA. © 2011 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved."

The rising cost of health care, the impact of the aging baby boomer generation, and declining revenues in a weakened economy continue to challenge the program's ability to provide quality and effective health services to its 45 million beneficiaries in a financially sustainable manner. On March 23, 2010, the President signed into law H.R. 3590, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA; P.L. 111-148), as passed by the Senate on December 24, 2009, and the House on March 21, 2010. The new law will, among other things, make numerous statutory changes to the Medicare program. On March 30, 2010, the President signed into law H.R. 4872, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (the ""Reconciliation Act,"" or HCERA; P.L. 111-152), which modifies a number of Medicare provisions in PPACA and adds several new provisions. This report, one of a series of CRS products on PPACA and the Reconciliation Act, examines the Medicare related provisions in these Acts. Estimates from CBO on PPACA and the Reconciliation Act indicate that net reductions in Medicare direct spending will reach approximately $390 billion from FY2010 to FY2019. Major savings are expected from constraining Medicare's annual payment increases for certain providers, tying maximum Medicare Advantage payments near or below spending in fee-for-service Medicare, reducing payments to hospitals that serve a large number of low-income patients, creating an Independent Payment Advisory Board to make changes in Medicare payment rates, and modifying the high-income threshold adjustment for Part B premiums. A new Hospital Insurance tax for high-wage earners will also raise approximately $87 billion over 10 years, and a new Medicare tax on net investment income, added by the Reconciliation Act, is expected to raise an additional $123 billion over 10 years. Other provisions in PPACA address more systemic issues, such as increasing the efficiency and quality of Medicare services and strengthening program integrity. For example, PPACA requires the establishment of a national, voluntary pilot program that will bundle payments for physician, hospital, and post-acute care services with the goal of improving patient care and reducing spending. Another provision adjusts payments to hospitals for readmissions related to certain potentially preventable conditions. In addition, PPACA subjects providers and suppliers to enhanced screening before allowing them to participate in the Medicare program, and both PPACA and the Reconciliation Act increase funding for anti-fraud activities. PPACA also improves some benefits provided to Medicare beneficiaries. For instance, Medicare prescription drug program enrollees will receive a 50% discount off the price of brand-name drugs during the coverage gap (the ""doughnut hole"") starting in 2011, and the coverage gap will be phased out by 2020. Other provisions expand assistance for some lowincome beneficiaries enrolled in the Medicare drug program, and eliminate beneficiary copayments for certain preventive care services. © 2011 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The tests are associated with improved clinical outcomes through preventing bone fractures. Cuts in Medicare Part B reimbursement for the provision of this preventive imaging in a physician's office began in 2007 and reached 56 percent below the 2006 level in January 2010. To encourage the use of DXA testing, the Affordable Care Act of 2010 provided partial relief from the cuts for two years (2010-11). Our study found that after a decade of growth, DXA testing in all Part B settings plateaued in 2007-09, resulting in 800,000 fewer tests than expected for Medicare beneficiaries-tests that might have prevented approximately 12,000 fractures. Testing declined in 2010, when the start of reimbursement relief under the Affordable Care Act was delayed, and increased outpatient testing failed to offset reduced use in physician offices. Our findings strongly suggest that the payment cuts reduced beneficiary access and that the tests were underused by elderly female Medicare beneficiaries despite strong association with fracture prevention.We recommend that Congress extend the payment relief granted under the Affordable Care Act for at least another two years. © 2011 Project HOPE-The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc."

However, the actual impact will depend on increasing the share of children and parents who are enrolled in public coverage and on other implementation outcomes. Most strikingly, if the requirement that states continue their Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) coverage is rescinded and if Congress does not continue funding CHIP, the uninsurance rate of children could more than double, increasing from 4.2 million to 7.9-9.1 million children.

We estimate that about 16% of plans will incur the tax upon implementation in 2018, while about 75% of plans will incur the tax a decade later due to the indexing of the tax thresholds with the Consumer Price Index. If the Cadillac tax is ultimately implemented as written, we find that it will likely reduce private health care benefits by .7% in 2018 and 3.1% in 2029, and will likely raise about $931 billion in revenue over the ensuing 10-year budget window from 2020 to 2029."

By providing guaranteed access to health care insurance at community rates, the ACA could reduce the problem of under-compensation resulting from damages caps. However, it may also exacerbate the problem of under-claiming in the malpractice system, thereby reducing incentives to invest in loss prevention activities. Shifting losses from liability insurers to health insurers could further undermine the already weak deterrent effect of the medical liability system. Republicans in Congress and physician groups both pushed for the adoption of a federal damages cap as part of health care reform. Physician support for damages caps could be explained by concerns about the insurance cycle and the consequent instability of the market. Our own study presented here suggests that there is greater insurance market stability in states with caps on non-economic damages. Republicans in Congress argued that the enactment of damages caps would reduce aggregate health care costs. The Congressional Budget Office included savings from reduced health care utilization in its estimates of cost savings that would result from the enactment of a federal damages cap. But notwithstanding recent opinions offered by the CBO, it is not clear that caps will significantly reduce health care costs or that any savings will be passed on to consumers. The ACA included funding for state level demonstration projects for promising reforms such as offer and disclosure and health courts, but at this time the benefits of these reforms are also uncertain.

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, also called ACA for short, impacts physician professional practice dramatically. Physicians are paid in the USA for their personal services. The payment system is highly variable in the private insurance market; however, governmental systems have a formula based payment, mostly based on the Medicare payment system. Physician services are billed under part B. The Neurointerventional practice is typically performed in a hospital setting. The VA system is a frequently cited successful implementation of a government supported health care program. Availability of neurointerventional services at many VA medical centers is limited. Since the inception of the Medicare program in 1965, several methods have been used to determine the amounts paid to physicians for each covered service. Initially, the payment systems compensated physicians on the basis of their charges. In 1975, just over 10 years after the inception of the Medicare program, payments changed so as not to exceed the increase in medical economic index. The involvement of medical economic index failed to curb increases in costs, leading to the determination of a yearly change in fees by legislation from 1984 to 1991. In 1992, the fee schedule essentially replaced the prior payment system that was based on the physician's charges, which also failed to curb the growth in spending. Thus, in 1998, the sustainable growth rate system was introduced. In 2009, multiple unsuccessful attempts were made by Congress to repeal the formula. The mechanism of the sustainable growth rate includes three components that are incorporated into a statutory formula: expenditure targets, growth rate period and annual adjustments of payment rates for physician services."

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) is designed to offer premium subsidies to help eligible individuals and their families purchase insurance coverage when affordable job-based coverage is not available. However, the law is unclear on how this affordability protection is applied in those instances where self-only coverage offered by an employer is affordable but family coverage is not. Regulations recently proposed by the Department of the Treasury would make family members ineligible for subsidized coverage in the exchange if an employee is offered affordable self-only coverage by an employer, even if family coverage is unaffordable. This could have significant financial consequences for low- and moderate-income families that fall in this gap. Using an alternative interpretation of the law could allow the entire family to enter the exchange when family coverage is unaffordable, which would broaden access to coverage. However, this option has been cited as cost prohibitive. In this brief we consider a middle ground alternative that would base eligibility for the individual worker on the cost of self-only coverage, but would use the additional cost to the employee for family coverage as the basis for determining affordability and eligibility for subsidies for the remaining family members. We find that: Under the middle ground alternative scenario an additional 144,000 Californians would qualify for and use premium subsidies in the California Health Benefit Exchange, half of whom are children. Less than 1 percent of those with employer-based coverage would move to subsidized coverage in the California Health Benefit Exchange as a result of having unaffordable coverage on the job."

The committee proposed eight new clinical preventive service recommendations aimed at closing significant gaps in preventive healthcare. This article reviews the process, findings, and the implications for obstetrician gynecologists and other primary care clinicians. Obstetricians and gynecologists play a major role in delivering primary care to women and many of the services recommended by the Committee are part of the core set of obstetrics and gynecology services. Recent findings: The women's health amendment to the ACA (Federal Register, 2010) requires that new private health plans cover - with no cost-sharing requirements - preventive healthcare services for women. Congress requested that a review be conducted to ascertain whether there were any additional needed preventive services specific to women's health that should be included. Summary: The IOM Committee on Preventive Services for Women recommended eight clinical measures specific to women's health that should be considered for coverage without co-payment. The US Department of HHS reviewed and adopted these recommendations, and, as a result, new health plans will need to include these services as part of insurance policies with plan years beginning on or after 1 August 2012.

To better understand components of an optimal process, we reviewed the literature and conducted interviews regarding the prioritization efforts of leading public and private health organizations in the United States and abroad. From this review, we propose a framework for prioritization, pose and answer key questions, and make recommendations regarding application of that framework.

Moreover, some of the most important drivers of health care costs, such as fee for service payments to physicians under Medicare or limitations on physician liability are not addressed adequately.

Health care is provided by a complex network of public, private and charitable entities operating in an environment of strong political ideologies, some of which are profoundly suspicious of the federal government. In this capitalist health care system, the proliferation of technologies and excessive use of medical procedures are driving the costs to unsustainable levels. Gross inefficiencies have created dangerous economic conditions with dramatic current and future social consequences. In March 2010 Congress approved the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, a bill that, over five years, puts in place universal health care and price controls. Its implementation is being aggressively challenged, however - twenty six states have filed suit against the legislation on the grounds that the mandate is unconstitutional as it violates personal liberties and is an abuse of federal powers.

Its goals are to monitor longitudinal trends in awareness, beliefs, utilization, and patient satisfaction relating to osteopathic physicians and to assess beliefs and attitudes regarding contemporary health care issues in the United States. The questionnaire was validated during the administrations of OSTEOSURV-I and OSTEOSURV-II in 1998 and 2000, respectively. In OSTEOSURV 2010, the contemporary health care issues of interest are patient-centered care and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010. Methods: The target population was household residents of the United States aged 18 years or older. A total of 10,308 random landline telephone numbers were dialed using a computer-assisted telephone interviewing system to acquire 1000 completed interviews between July 23, 2010, and October 1, 2010. The response, cooperation, and contact rates as defined by the American Association for Public Opinion Research were comparable to those of other national telephone surveys. The survey provides an estimated margin of error no greater than 3% to 4% for both general items and for those relating to the subset of respondents claiming to be aware of osteopathic physicians. Because respondents were older and more likely to be female than referents in the general population, the observed responses will be weighted by age and sex to reflect the US Census estimates for persons aged 18 years or older in 2010. Discussion:OSTEOSURV 2010 was successfully fielded as the latest national telephone survey relevant to osteopathic medicine and contemporary US health care issues. Data analysis should yield important new findings relating to osteopathic physicians, patient-centered care, and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act that may not be readily observed through other national health care data sets. While underrepresented in this survey, which excluded cell phone -only participants, young adult respondents were reflective of their national age referents with regard to health insurance coverage and general health status. Thus, it appears likely that statistical weighting by age and sex of the OSTEOSURV 2010 data will minimize potential bias in estimates of health-related items. Rapidly evolving technology and sociocultural transitions will necessitate changes in the design of OSTEOSURV 2020."

In light of this background, we borrow from systems engineering and business management to present the concept of service co-production as a new paradigm for healthcare delivery and, using the foresight afforded by this model, to systematically identify the barriers to healthcare delivery functioning as a service system. The service co-production model requires for patient, provider, insurer, administrator, and all the related healthcare individuals to collaborate at all stages - prevention, triage, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up - of the healthcare delivery system in order to produce optimal health outcomes. Our analysis reveals that the barriers to co-production - the misalignment of financial and legal incentives, limited incorporation of collaborative point of care systems, and poor access to care - also serve as the source of many of the systemic failings of the U.S. healthcare system. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act takes steps to reduce these barriers, but leaves work to be done. Future research and policy reform is needed to enable effective and efficient co-production in the twenty-first century. With this review, we assess the state of service co-production in the U.S. healthcare system, and propose solutions for improvement. © 2012, IGI Global."

Public acquiescence provided crucial political cover; elites on both sides struggled mightily to sway popular opinion. Were reformers' efforts made easier or more difficult by the tough economic times? Using newly available data on Americans' perceptions of economic insecurity and attitudes toward public policy, this article explores the relationship between economic circumstances and political attitudes. The findings suggest that the Great Recession both facilitated and impeded efforts to rally the public in favor of reform: perceptions of past declines in the U.S. economy bolstered government intervention, but household economic insecurity both distracted attention from large medical expenses (which otherwise legitimized collective action) and undermined Americans' support for additional government spending. Equally consequential, reformers' efforts to adapt to economic stringency by portraying reform as exclusively about affordability missed opportunities for broadening popular support for these interventions; in the longer run this may, unless corrected, prove a decisive misstep in shepherding the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act through its long time line of implementation. © 2011 by Duke University Press."

This view is fundamentally wrong. The Necessary and Proper Clause is based on eighteenth-century agency law, including the fundamental agency doctrine of principals and incidents. Accordingly, the Clause only allows Congress to exercise powers that are incident to-meaning subordinate to or less ""worthy"" than-its principal enumerated powers. The power to compel private persons to engage in commercial transactions with other private persons is not an incidental power. Thus, the mandate is not authorized by the Necessary and Proper Clause, whether or not such a power is ""necessary and proper for carrying into Execution"" other powers. In addition, eighteenth-century public law carried administrative law principles-including the fiduciary norms at the heart of agency law-into delegations of power to political actors. One of the most basic of these fiduciary norms is the obligation to treat multiple principals equally. That equal treatment requirement is violated by the individual mandate, which compels transactions with a favored oligopoly of insurance companies. In short, the mandate is not an exercise of incidental power within the scope of the Necessary and Proper Clause, nor is the mandate ""proper.""."

To assess whether the Exchanges are likely to achieve these goals, this paper evaluates their potential to fulfll three basic conditions of a competitive market, and analyzes how well the subsidy and credit systems will function if enrollees face a healthcare crisis. The Exchanges are likely to meet the basic conditions for a robust health insurance market to varying degrees, and for the average family in an average healthcare utilization year, direct assistance through the Exchanges signifcantly improves affordability. However, in the case of a healthcare crisis that drives utilization and costs up near the upper thresholds of subsidies, there is wide variance in the total impact healthcare costs may have on a family or individual budget. States can enhance several of the provisions laid out in the ACA such as stronger regulation of plan design in the Exchanges, electronic interfaces linking costs to income, healthcare navigators, and others to ensure that the credits and subsidies go far enough when families may need them most and that plans are more affordable to purchase. While federal action has paved the way for increased access to affordable health insurance, state action will determine whether the Exchanges actually fulfll that promise."

Between 1997 and 2009, the boundaries of community access were redrawn and redefined with the introduction of a series of 13 bills to change how Medicaid requires states to fund LTSS. Although they did not successfully pass into law, their presence is felt in the language of the Community First Choice (CFC) Option, part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) of 2010. This chapter documents and analyzes the changes in the concept of community access as reflected across these bills and the CFC. Methodology - The text of these 13 bills and the CFC were compared with attention to structure, order, and meaning. Documents were hand coded and electronically searched. Codes were entered into atlas.ti for comparison and analysis. Findings - Four significant changes in the conceptualization of community access emerged: (1) who deserves access to community, (2) what community access entails, (3) why people deserve access to community, and (4) how community access should be organized. With the exception of the reasons why people deserve access to community, the expanded concept of community access illustrated across these bills is reflected in the text of CFC.

Provider-to-provider data exchange is an explicit goal of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and may be essential for the long-term success of the Affordable Care Act of 2010. However, little is known about what factors affect clinicians' usage of health information exchange (HIE) functionality. Objective: To identify factors that affect clinicians' HIE usage - in terms of frequency of contributing data to and accessing data from aggregate patient records - and suggest policies for fostering its usage. Methods: We performed a qualitative study using grounded theory by interviewing clinician-users and HIE staff of one operational HIE which supported aggregate patient record functionality. Fifteen clinicians were interviewed for one hour each about what factors affect their HIE usage. Five HIE staff were asked about technology and training issues to provide context. Interviews were recorded, transcribed and analyzed. Recruitment excluded clinicians with little or no familiarity with the HIE and was restricted to one community and a small number of specialties. Results: Clinicians were motivated to access the HIE by perceived improvements in care quality and time savings, but their motivation was moderated by an extensive list of factors including gaps in data, workflow issues and usability issues. HIE access intensities varied widely by clinician. Data contribution intensities to the HIE also varied widely and were affected by billing concerns and time constraints. Conclusions: Clinicians, EHR and HIE product vendors and trainers should work toward integrating HIE into clinical workflows. Policies should create incentives for HIE organizations to assist clinicians in using HIE, develop measures of HIE contributions and accesses, and create incentives for clinicians to contribute data to HIEs. © Schattauer 2011."

In the next several years, several measures of ED crowding will be assessed and reported on government websites. In addition, with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), millions more Americans will have health care insurance, many of whom will choose the ED for their care. In June 2011, a consensus conference was conducted in Boston, Massachusetts, by the journal Academic Emergency Medicine entitled ""Interventions to Assure Quality in the Crowded Emergency Department."" The overall goal of the conference was to develop a series of research agendas to identify promising interventions to safeguard the quality of emergency care during crowded periods and to reduce ED crowding altogether through systemwide solutions. This was achieved through three objectives: 1) a review of interventions that have been implemented to reduce crowding and summarize the evidence of their effectiveness on the delivery of emergency care; 2) to identify strategies within or outside of the health care setting (i.e., policy, engineering, operations management, system design) that may help reduce crowding or improve the quality of emergency care provided during episodes of ED crowding; and 3) to identify the most appropriate design and analytic techniques for rigorously evaluating ED interventions designed to reduce crowding or improve the quality of emergency care provided during episodes of ED crowding.

Our objective was to describe health plan efforts to collect language data from its members, provide language services, and improve the provision of culturally and linguistically appropriate services (CLAS). Study Design: National surveys in 2003, 2006, and 2008. Methods: Surveys were administered to health plans offering commercial, Medicaid, and/or Medicare Advantage products. Results: 123 health plans responded to the 2008 survey (50% response rate), including 65 commercial (50%), 46 Medicaid (53%), and 12 Medicare plans (44%), representing a total enrollment of 133.8 million Americans. In 2008, 74.0% of health plans collected language data (commercial 60.0%, Medicaid 89.1%, Medicare 91.7%), which is an increase for each plan type since 2003. Health plans used direct and indirect collection methods. Nearly all health plans reported offering language services, the most common being telephonic interpreting, multilingual member materials, and access to bilingual providers. A variety of strategies for improving CLAS were cited by health plans, including improving health plan communication materials, health literacy initiatives for members, and targeted training for providers and staff. Conclusions: Health plans have made substantial progress in the collection of language data and many are offering options for language services. With the rapid growth in Medicaid participation and newly insured individuals anticipated under the Affordable Care Act, health plans may be uniquely positioned to implement and test interventions that aim to improve appropriate utilization of language services by providers and patients."

This second law, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (HCERA; P.L. 111-152), was signed into law on March 30, 2010. Together these measures constitute what is referred to as the health care reform law, which makes many significant changes to the private and public markets for health insurance, as well as modifies aspects of the publicly financed health care delivery system. It represents the most significant reform to the Medicaid program since its establishment in 1965. This report details some of the major changes to the Medicaid and CHIP programs and provides a timeline of effective dates for these provisions. In general, the Medicaid law (1) raises Medicaid income eligibility levels for certain people up to 133% of the federal poverty level, (2) adds both mandatory and optional benefits to Medicaid, (3) increases the federal matching payments for certain groups of beneficiaries and for particular services provided, (4) provides new requirements and incentives for states to improve quality of care and encourage more use of preventive services, and (5) makes a number of other Medicaid program changes. Regarding CHIP, the law includes a new requirement for states to maintain their current program structures through FY2019 and extends additional CHIP funding through FY2015. To help explain the most important Medicaid and CHIP changes, provision descriptions are grouped into the following six major issue areas: eligibility, benefits, financing, program integrity, demonstrations and grant funding, and miscellaneous. Appendix A provides a detailed implementation timeline of the Medicaid and CHIP provisions. Appendix B is a crosswalk between the provision titles and the amending sections of P.L. 111-148 and P.L. 111-152 for all of the Medicaid and CHIP provisions. Finally, Appendix C is a list of abbreviations used in this report and their definitions. This report will be updated as needed. © 2011 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved."

It was established in 1965 under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act as a federal entitlement program to provide health insurance to individuals 65 and older, and has been expanded over the years to include permanently disabled individuals under 65. Medicare, which consists of four parts (A-D), covers hospitalizations, physician services, prescription drugs, skilled nursing facility care, home health visits, and hospice care, among other services. Generally, individuals are eligible for Medicare if they or their spouse worked for at least 40 quarters in Medicare-covered employment, are 65 years old, and are a citizen or permanent resident of the United States. Individuals may also qualify for coverage if they are a younger person with a permanent disability, have End-Stage Renal disease (permanent kidney failure requiring dialysis or transplant), or have amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease). In FY2010, the program will cover an estimated 47 million persons (39 million aged and 8 million disabled) at an estimated total cost of about $521 billion, accounting for approximately 3.6% of GDP. Medicare is an entitlement program, which means that it is required to pay for services provided to eligible persons so long as specific criteria are met. Since 1965, the Medicare program has undergone considerable changes. Most recently, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA, P.L. 111-148) and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (HCERA, P.L. 111-152), signed into law on March 23, 2010, and March 30, 2010, respectively, made numerous changes to the Medicare program that modify provider reimbursements, provide incentives to increase the quality and efficiency of care, and enhance certain Medicare benefits. Having passed health reform legislation in March 2010, the remaining months of the 111th Congress may be partly spent working on addressing Medicare physician payment issues and on identifying and making any necessary technical fixes to the March legislation.

Historically, Medicare covered only diagnostic and treatment services, not preventive services provided in the absence of illness. Generally, adding coverage of a preventive service required statutory authority. Since 1980, Congress has established Medicare coverage for several preventive services in law. Recently, Congress gave the Secretary of HHS limited authority to cover new Medicare preventive services administratively. While many view preventive services as a means to improve the quality of health care by preventing illness, disability, and death, some have also touted prevention as a means to contain health care costs. However, whether expanding coverage or utilization of preventive services would actually save money for Medicare is a matter of debate. While these screenings may be effective in preventing premature death or other unwanted outcomes in some beneficiaries, their broad use may incur a net cost for the Medicare program, rather than savings. Efforts have also been made to determine whether specific preventive services are effective, and whether their use would be likely to benefit the patient without posing potential risks from the procedure itself. Congress has in the past sought the advice of expert panels to make these assessments. However, none of these panels is explicitly charged with evaluating preventive services for the purposes of Medicare coverage. For example, current Medicare coverage of preventive services does not always comport with evidence-based recommendations of a prominent expert panel, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF). A recent USPSTF recommendation regarding screening mammography has refocused congressional attention on the appropriate role of advisory panels with respect to Medicare coverage decisions. In November 2009, the House passed the Affordable Health Care for America Act (H.R. 3962). In December 2009, the Senate passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (an amendment to H.R. 3590). Each bill would, in general, expand Medicare coverage of preventive services, and reduce or eliminate most cost-sharing for these services. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has scored most of these proposals as incurring a net cost for Medicare. The House is preparing to vote on Senate-passed H.R. 3590 and on an accompanying reconciliation bill (H.R. 4872) that would change several controversial elements in the Senate-passed bill and otherwise amend it so that its budgetary impact meets the reconciliation instructions in last year's budget resolution. If the House approves H.R. 3590, it will be sent to the President to be signed into law. The reconciliation measure, if approved by the House, would then be taken up by the Senate. This report first discusses the legislative and administrative history of Medicare coverage of preventive services. Then it discusses several advisory panels that have evaluated the effectiveness of preventive services, Medicare coverage of these services, or utilization of these services. Next, it discusses whether or not the use of preventive services would be costsaving or cost-effective for Medicare, and whether utilization of preventive services can be improved. The report then presents relevant proposals in pending health reform legislation. Finally, the Appendix compares current Medicare coverage of preventive services with current USPSTF recommendations.

Health reform had been the Obama Administration's top domestic priority, driven by concerns about the growing ranks of the uninsured and the unsustainable growth in spending on health care and health insurance. Improving access to care and controlling rising costs were seen to require changes to both the financing and delivery of health care. This chapter, one of a series of CRS products on PPACA, as amended by HCERA, focuses on the new law's workforce, public health, health care quality, and related provisions. It includes summaries of these provisions, explores some of their implications for health policy, and contains an associated timeline. PPACA includes numerous provisions intended to increase the primary care and public health workforce, promote preventive services, and strengthen quality measurement, among other things. It amends and expands many of the existing health workforce programs authorized under Title VII (health professions) and Title VIII (nursing) of the Public Health Service Act (PHSA); creates a Public Health Services Track to train health care professionals emphasizing team-based service, public health, epidemiology, and emergency preparedness and response; and makes a number of changes to the Medicare graduate medical education (GME) payments to teaching hospitals, in part to encourage the training of more primary care physicians. The new law also establishes a national commission to study projected health workforce needs. In addition, PPACA creates an interagency council to promote healthy policies and prepare a national prevention and health promotion strategy. It establishes a Prevention and Public Health Fund to boost funding for prevention and public health; increases access to clinical preventive services under Medicare and Medicaid; promotes healthier communities; and funds research on optimizing the delivery of public health services. Funding also is provided for maternal and child health services, including abstinence education and a new home visitation program. PPACA also establishes a national strategy for quality improvement; creates an interagency working group to advance quality efforts at the national level; develops a comprehensive repertoire of quality measures; and formalizes processes for quality measure selection, endorsement, data collection, and public reporting of quality information. It creates and funds a new private, nonprofit comparative effectiveness research institute. Other key provisions in PPACA include programs to prevent elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation; a new regulatory pathway for licensing biological drugs shown to be biosimilar or interchangeable with a licensed biologic; new nutrition labeling requirements for chain restaurant menus and vending machines; new requirements for the collection and reporting of health data by race, ethnicity, and primary language to detect and monitor trends in health disparities; and electronic format and data standards to improve the efficiency of administrative and financial transactions between health care providers and health plans. HCERA amends several of the PPACA provisions discussed in this chapter. Those provisions address funding for community health centers and the National Health Service Corps, 340B drug pricing, and taxes on prescription drugs and medical devices. © 2011 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Opponents have argued that the individual mandate is a regulation of inactivity, and therefore beyond the scope of the Commerce Clause. This Comment argues that Congress should pass a statute conditioning federal Medicaid funding for each state on that state's adoption of an individual mandate. This alternative arrangement shifts the debate from the scope of Congress's commerce power to the scope of its spending power. The controlling framework for evaluating the constitutionality of conditional-funding statutes was articulated by Chief Justice William Rehnquist in South Dakota v. Dole. After designing such a statute, this Comment demonstrates that the arrangement is not barred by any of the four Spending Clause limitations announced in Dole, or by the requirement that Congress not ""coerce"" the state into adopting regulations. The spending is for the general welfare. The condition imposed on the states is unambiguous. The condition is related to a federal interest. And finally, there is no independent constitutional bar precluding the arrangement. The current form of the individual mandate has created constitutional uncertainty because it presses against the boundaries of the Supreme Court's Commerce Clause jurisprudence. The form of the individual mandate proposed by this Comment, however, falls squarely within the bounds of the Court's Spending Clause jurisprudence."

However, there are other provisions of the law that would greatly mitigate this effect. For example, the subsidies provided in the law to help people purchase coverage through health insurance exchanges would restrain a premium spiral by absorbing much of the impact of premium increases. We estimate that if the mandate were lifted, premiums in the individual market would increase by 12.6 percent-somewhat less than other estimates-with 7.8 million people losing coverage, versus other estimates for coverage loss of 16-24 million people. In sum, the Affordable Care Act would still cover 23 million people who would have been uninsured without the law.

We examine the constitutionality of the individual mandate by analyzing relevant court decisions. A critical issue has been defining the ""activities"" Congress is authorized to regulate. Some judges determined that the mandate was constitutional because the decision to go without health insurance, that is, to self-insure, is an activity with substantial economic effects within the overall scheme of the ACA.

Design.-Assessment of the provisions of Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, other reform efforts, and reform initiatives focusing on future quality and safety provisions for health care providers. Results.-Health care reform and other efforts focus on consumerism in the context of price. Quality and safety efforts will be structured using financial incentives, bestpractices research, and new delivery models that focus on reaching benchmarks while reducing costs. In addition, patient experience will be a key component of reimbursement, and a move toward ""retail"" approaches directed at the individual patient may supplant traditional "" wholesale"" efforts at attracting employers. Conclusions.-Quality and safety have always been of prime importance in medicine.

This issue brief analyzes changes in private employer-based health premiums and deductibles for all states from 2003 to 2010, and finds total premiums for family coverage increased 50 percent across states and employee annual share of premiums increased by 63 percent over these seven years. At the same time, per-person deductibles doubled in large, as well as small, firms. If premium trends continue at the rate prior to enactment of the Affordable Care Act, the average premium for family coverage will rise 72 percent by 2020, to nearly $24,000. Health reform offers the potential to reduce insurance cost growth while improving financial protections. If efforts succeed in slowing annual premium growth by 1 percentage point, by 2020 employers and families together would save $2,161 annually for family coverage, compared with projected premiums at historical rates of increase."

With the high cost of exams and steady growth through the last decade, imaging appears to be a prime target for savings under accountable care. Given that some of the reform payment models are set to begin as early as next year, and private payers are increasingly instituting similar risk-based payment models in their plans, it is critical for imaging leaders to understand how these models will affect their growth strategy and prepare accordingly. A thorough analysis of the various payment models, considering all possible targets for cost savings, is required to accurately determine the timing and impact for imaging."

Consideration is given to these particular PPACA mandates and to Internal Revenue Service (IRS) actions to implement them. The background of concerns that have been expressed about whether the NFP hospitals' tax exemption should be continued and a brief history of that exemption is noted.

How many enroll will greatly affect health care access, demand for clinicians, and the federal budget, yet the precision and validity of enrollment estimates made to date is unknown. We created a simulation model using two nationally representative data sets to determine the range of reasonable projections, estimating eligibility, participation, and population growth using prior research and our data. Our model predicted that the number of additional people enrolling in Medicaid under health reform may vary by more than 10 million, with a base-case estimate of 13.4 million and a possible range of 8.5 million to 22.4 million. Estimated federal spending for new Medicaid enrollees ranged from $34 billion to $98 billion annually, and we projected that 4,500-12,100 new physicians will be needed to care for new enrollees. In the end, Medicaid enrollment will be determined largely by the extent to which federal and state efforts encourage or discourage eligible people from enrolling.

It reviews the historical context, discusses the ""promise and fear"" of CER, and then describes the new role of the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) in defining and sponsoring CER. The second paper, ""Ten Commandments,"" proposes a series of tenets for planning, conducting, and reporting CER done with RWD. Oriented for basic-to-intermediate researchers, it combines standard scientific research principles with considerations specific to nonrandomized, RWD studies. The third article, ""Infrastructure Requirements,"" points out that effective use of secondary data requires addressing major methodological and infrastructural issues, including development of analytical tools to readily access and analyze data, formulation of guidelines to enhance quality and transparency, establishment of data standards, and creation of data warehouses that respect the privacy and confidentiality of patients. It identifies gaps that must be filled to address the underlying issues, with emphasis on data standards, data quality assurance, data warehouses, computing environment, and protection of privacy and confidentiality. The fourth paper, ""Statistical Issues,"" discusses how the validity of analytic results from observational studies is adversely impacted by biases that may be introduced due to lack of randomization. It reviews some of the methodological challenges that arise in the analysis of data from nonrandomized studies, with particular emphasis on the limitations of traditional approaches and potential solutions from recent methodological developments. The fifth paper, ""Considerations on the Use of Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs),"" describes how PRO data can play a critical role in guiding patients, health care providers, payers, and policy makers in making informed decisions regarding patient-centered treatment from among alternative options and technologies and have been noted as such by PCORI. However, collection and interpretation of such data within the context of CER have not yet been fully established. It discusses some challenges with including PROs in CER initiatives, provides a framework for their effective use, and proposes several areas for future research. Lastly, ""Developing a Collaborative Study Protocol..."" indicates that there is the potential, the desire, and the capability for payers to be involved in CER studies, combining elements of their own observational data with prospective studies. It describes a case example of a payer, a pharmaceutical company, and a research organization collaborating on a prospective study to examine the effect of prior authorization for pregabalin on health care costs to the payer.   Researchers at Pfizer routinely conduct CER-type studies. In this supplement, we have proposed some approaches that we believe are useful in developing certain kinds of evidence and have described some of our experiences. Our experiences also make us acutely aware of the limitations of approaches and data sources that have been used for CER studies and suggest that there is a need to further develop methods that are most useful for answering CER questions."

Those designated as federally qualified health centers (FQHCs), in particular, have largely established themselves as key providers of comprehensive, efficient, high-quality primary care services to low-income people, especially Medicaid and uninsured patients. The Center for Studying Health System Change's (HSC's) site visits to 12 nationally representative metropolitan communities since 1996 document substantial growth in FQHC capacity, based on growing numbers of Medicaid enrollees and uninsured people, increased federal support, and improved managerial acumen. At the same time, FQHC development has varied considerably across communities because of several important factors, including local health system characteristics and financial and political support at federal, state and local levels. Some communities--Boston; Syracuse, N.Y.; Miami; and Seattle--have relatively extensive FQHC capacity for their Medicaid and uninsured populations, while other communities--Lansing, Mich.; northern New Jersey; Indianapolis; and Greenville, S.C.--fall in the middle. FQHC growth in Phoenix; Little Rock, Ark.; Cleveland; and Orange County, Calif.; has lagged in comparison. Today, FQHCs seem poised to play a key role in federal health care reform, including coverage expansions and the emphasis on primary care and medical homes."

Natural leaders of such a transformation are the complementary and alternative medicine practitioners who already share a vision of wellness, prevention, and optimal human function. Central to this shared vision is lifestyle change for patients and practitioners. Yet, to change a lifestyle is to change a self. Assisting individuals to transform their very sense of self in order to live healthier, more fulfilling lives centered on flourishing requires several important keys. Visionary and unified leaders are the first key. Structural support through coordination of health clinics locally and nationally is the second key. This can be optimized by utilizing initiatives of the new Affordable Health Care Act, because it provides a potential impetus for deep structural changes. An expanded evidence base for multifactorial approaches to wellness lifestyles is the third key. A reorganizational orientation with an emphasis on the right timing of transformation is the fourth key. The fifth key is an Integral map, which brings together the personal, behavioral, cultural, and social domains. By utilizing such a map, one ensures that no aspect of the transformative revolution at hand slips away due to any misplaced focus, such as emphasizing only on the things we can see with our eyes. By embracing the essence of transformation in terms of a wholeness to all reality, an evolutionary unifying field with interior depth and exterior expression, health care is redefined more authentically. © Copyright 2011, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2011."

We evaluated the initial ""road test"" of PROMETHEUS Payment, one of several bundled payment pilot projects. The project has faced substantial implementation challenges, and none of the three pilot sites had executed contracts or made bundled payments as of May 2011.

However, there are limited empirical data detailing the prevalence and magnitude of these relationships. Our objective was to use data made available by a US Department of Justice (DOJ) lawsuit to describe the extent of orthopedic surgeons' financial relationships with implant manufacturers. Methods: We used data made available by the 2007 DOJ settlement with 5 major joint implant manufacturers to detail the number of orthopedic surgeons receiving payments, the size of these payments, the aggregate dollar amount, and the proportion going to academically affiliated orthopedic surgeons between 2007 and 2010. Results: In 2007, 1041 payments totaling in excess of $198 million were made to 939 orthopedic surgeons. In 2008, following the DOJ settlement, the implant makers made 568 payments totaling more than $228 million to 526 orthopedic surgeons (which included $109 million in one-time royalty buyouts by a single firm). The proportion of surgeons receiving payments who had academic affiliations rose from 39.4% in 2007 to 44.9% in 2008. Similar patterns were observed in 2009 and 2010 for 3 firms that continued to disclose by choice. We also noted substantial variation across firms in the details provided in the disclosed data. Conclusions: The impact of the DOJ settlement in the short term appears complex, with an increase in payments, a decline in the number of consultants, and an increase in the proportion of consultants drawn from academia. There is a need for clearer specific requirements for disclosure to allow for meaningful long-term analyses to be performed. © 2011 American Medical Association. All rights reserved."

A contentious debate continues even after the law was enacted, and many have tried to reduce its controversial nature either to political or economic factors. Though these factors are surely important, I argue that there is another layer of disagreement, and it is a specifically ethical one that has been largely ignored in public debates. The central question in the ethical debate is whether and to what extent citizens in the US have a right to healthcare. To address this fundamental question I choose two of the most prominent physicians in the US who have written on this topic, then I highlight ten ethical presuppositions that underlie both of their positions on the right to healthcare, and finally I compare and contrast their views on each of the presuppositions. One of the physicians, Robert M. Sade, has argued strongly against any right to healthcare in the US, while the other, Edmund Pellegrino, has been an influential proponent of such a right. In the conclusion I argue that, for any meaningful and informed debate to continue in the US on healthcare reform, it will be necessary to address not only the political and economic issues but also those ethical presuppositions that underlie, shape and inform one's position on the right to healthcare. © 2011 by Louvain Studies, all rights reserved."

These include making certain that quality improvement efforts measure disparities and improvements in them, notwithstanding providers' reputational concerns; that such efforts not create perverse incentives for providers to avoid serving minority patients; that they be applied to institutions where minority patients are most likely to receive care; and that they fully engage minority patients despite language or other barriers.

To offset the financial burden for lower-income households, it also provides subsidies to ensure that health insurance premiums are affordable. However, relatively little work has been done on how such affordability standards should be set. The existing literature on affordability is not grounded in social norms and has methodological and theoretical flaws. To address these issues, we developed a series of hypothetical vignettes in which individual and household sociodemographic characteristics were varied. We then convened a panel of eighteen experts with extensive experience in affordability standards to evaluate the extent to which each vignette character could afford to pay for one of two health insurance plans. The panel varied with respect to political ideology and discipline. We find that there was considerable disagreement about how affordability is defined. There was also disagreement about what might be included in an affordability standard, with substantive debate surrounding whether savings, debt, education, or single parenthood is relevant. There was also substantial variation in experts' assessed affordability scores. Nevertheless, median expert affordability assessments were not far from those of ACA. © 2011 by Duke University Press."

Specifically, health insurance plays a limited but significant role in protecting opportunity in two ways: it helps keep people functioning normally and it protects their financial security. Together these benefits enable household members to exercise reasonable choices about their plans of life. To achieve truly affordable coverage, society must be able to contain the overall cost of health care, and health insurance must be progressively financed, meaning that those who are best able to pay for coverage should pay the largest share. While the recently passed Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) falls short on both of these counts, we argue that it makes important contributions toward household affordability through the use of subsidies and regulations.

This article describes factors that influenced the determination of affordability benchmarks and premium-contribution requirements for Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) expansions in three states that sought to universalize access to coverage for youth. It also compares subsidy levels developed in these states to the premium subsidy schedule under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) for health insurance plans purchased through an exchange. We find sizeable variability in premium-contribution requirements for children's coverage as a percentage of family income across the three states and in the progressivity and regressivity of the premium-contribution schedules developed. These findings underscore the ambiguity and subjectivity of affordability standards. Further, our analyses suggest that while the ACA increases the affordability of family coverage for families with incomes below 400 percent of the federal poverty level, the evolution of CHIP over the next five to ten years will continue to have significant implications for low-income families. © 2011 by Duke University Press."

Methods: Data from the 1993 through 2009 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, a telephone survey that uses randomdigit dialing, were used to examine the prevalence of uninsurance among nearly 3 million respondents by self-report of frequent physical and frequent mental distress and sociodemographic characteristics, response year, and state of residence. Results: After adjustment for sociodemographic characteristics, uninsurance among adults aged 18 to 64 years was markedly higher among those with frequent mental distress only (22.6%) and those with both frequent mental and frequent physical distress (21.8%) than among those with frequent physical distress only (17.7%). The prevalence of uninsurance did not differ markedly between those with only frequent mental distress and those with both frequent mental distress and frequent physical distress. The prevalence of uninsurance among those with frequent mental distress only and those with neither frequent mental distress nor frequent physical distress increased significantly over time. Conclusions: Uninsurance rates among nonelderly adults with frequent mental distress were disproportionately high.

Each state establishes its own laws and regulations regarding insurer activities, including premium increases for the insurance products within its purview. The authority that state regulators have to review and deny requests for premium changes varies from state to state, as do the amount of resources available to state insurance departments for reviewing premium changes. In some markets where insurers have proposed or implemented steep increases, such changes have received considerable attention from the press, state regulators, and policymakers. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) requires annual review of premium increases and disclosure of those increases determined unreasonable beginning in September 2011. Under PPACA, each state will conduct these reviews for individual and small-group health insurance unless the federal government concludes they do not have an effective review program and assumes review responsibility. As they did prior to PPACA, state laws govern whether rates go into effect and establish the parameters of regulators' authority. This issue brief outlines specific state and federal roles in the rate review process and changes to rate review processes since PPACA was enacted."

The PPACA will have a significant impact on future physicians, yet medical student perspectives on the legislation have not been well documented. Objective: To evaluate medical students' understanding of and attitudes toward healthcare reform and the PPACA including issues of quality, access and cost. Design, Setting, and Participants: An anonymous electronic survey was sent to medical students at 10 medical schools (total of 6982 students) between October-December 2010, with 1232 students responding and a response rate of 18%. Main Outcome Measures: Medical students' views and attitudes regarding the PPACA and related topics, measured with Likert scale and open response items. Results: Of medical students surveyed, 94.8% agreed that the existing United States healthcare system needs to be reformed, 31.4% believed the PPACA will improve healthcare quality, while 20.9% disagreed and almost half (47.7%) were unsure if quality will be improved. Two thirds (67.6%) believed that the PPACA will increase access, 6.5% disagreed and the remaining 25.9% were unsure. With regard to containing healthcare costs, 45.4% of participants indicated that they are unsure if the provisions of the PPACA will do so. Overall, 80.1% of respondents indicated that they support the PPACA, and 78.3% also indicated that they did not feel that reform efforts had gone far enough. A majority of respondents (58.8%) opposed repeal of the PPACA, while 15.0% supported repeal, and 26.1% were undecided.

CHIPRA also requires core measures to identify disparities by race and ethnicity, among other factors. State Medicaid and CHIP programs are currently facing significant budgetary pressures that are likely to increase with eligibility expansions and programmatic changes resulting from the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA). To limit the burden on states and increase the likelihood of states' voluntarily reporting on core pediatric quality measures, HHS may consider utilizing existing data sources. This article examines the feasibility of utilizing Medicaid Statistical Information System (MSIS) data to identify and analyze the core children's healthcare quality measures required by CHIPRA. Five key themes related to the feasibility of using MSIS as a data source for quality measures are identified: states have significant experience with data collection, performance measurement, and quality oversight for children in Medicaid and CHIP; CHIPRA provisions related to reporting of quality measures will be implemented at a time when states are facing major fiscal constraints; MSIS provides potential opportunities as it offers a rich source of data, but the difficulties in obtaining clean data should not be underestimated; MSIS has limitations; and states, the federal government, providers, and enrollees benefit from standardization in data and quality measurement."

Projecting the impacts of such fundamental reform to the health care system is fraught with difficulty. But such projections were required for the legislative process, and were delivered by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). This paper discusses the projected impact of the ACA in more detail, and describes evidence that sheds light upon the accuracy of the projections. It begins by reviewing in broad detail the structure of the ACA, and then reviews evidence from a key case study that informs our understanding of the ACA's impacts: a comparable health reform that was carried out in Massachusetts four years earlier.

This article briefly addresses two interesting policy paradoxes about the ACA. First, while the legislation primarily addresses health care financing and insurance and establishes only a few initiatives directly targeting public health, the ACA nevertheless has the potential to produce extensive public health benefits across the United States population by improving access to health care and services and reducing cost. Essentially, the ACA does not take the explicit form of a public health law but instead strives to advance public health indirectly through its effects. Second, while the ACA does not establish a right to health - or even a right to health insurance - in the United States, it does set in motion a number of significant structural and normative changes to United States law that comport with the attainment of the right to health. Most significantly, key provisions of the bill are designed to improve availability, accessibility, acceptability, and quality of conditions necessary for health, and to prompt the government to respect, protect, and fulfill these conditions. These developments mean that, to a degree, the United States essentially has undertaken the same types of legal and policy steps that a country would be required to take to uphold the right to health without actually recognizing the right to health in any formal or legally binding way. Despite these dual paradoxes and the upside potential for public health improvements resulting from the ACA, the public health impact of the law remains uncertain and will be decided by numerous subsequent regulatory and implementation decisions. The ACA authorizes multiple federal agencies to engage in rulemaking, a process that will largely dictate the systemic and health impacts that will become its legacy. This reality opens up ample opportunity to bolster public health aspects and interpretations of the law, and to simultaneously augment the corresponding components of the right to health. © 2011 American Society of Law, Medicine & Ethics, Inc."

Several courts initially considering this argument have rejected it, but federal district courts in Virginia and Florida have concurred, leading to numerous appeals and prospective review of the United States Supreme Court. Despite creative arguments, the dispositive constitutional question is not whether Congress' interstate commerce power extends to commercial inactivity. Rather, it is whether Congress may regulate individual decisions with significant economic ramifications in the interests of protecting and promoting the public's health.

This essay situates PPACA's mandate, and the opposition to it, in that broader context. The article reviews the arguments that public health's population perspective provides in support of mandates, as well as the reasons why mandates often ignite intense legal and political opposition.

This paper provides estimates of the loading fees by firm size using data from the confidential Medical Expenditure Panel Survey Household Component-Insurance Component Linked File. Overall, we find an inverse relationship between employer group size and loading fees. Firms of up to 100 employees face similar loading fees of approximately 34%.

A disproportionate number of these women were African American or Latino. In addition, many women aged 55 to 64 lack coverage through either their own employment or access to a spouse's plan at a time when they face an elevated risk of long-term and life-threatening illness. The study's objective is to understand the extent to which the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, signed in March 2010, will increase coverage for pre-retirement age women through the new health insurance exchanges and the expanded Medicaid program. Methods: This study employs the 2009 American Community Survey to compare health insurance coverage among aging women by race and ethnicity. Results: The results reveal that the new health care law could reduce the number of uninsured pre-retirement age women from 11.7% to 1.9%. However, it is unlikely that all women with the opportunity to access health insurance coverage will do so. In addition, despite the potential increase in access, Mexican-American women are still overrepresented among the uninsured, representing 5.7% of the total uninsured while only comprising 3.3% of all pre-retirement age women. Conclusion: The research has important implications for how numerous provisions enacted in the new health care law will reduce the number of uninsured adults, particularly vulnerable women. These findings make it clear that Medicaid expansion and insurance exchanges will vary across states, and consequently will have potential benefits in particular for low-income minority group women. © 2011 Jacobs Institute of Women's Health."

One of these promotes the use of at-work wellness programs by both providing employers with grants to develop these programs and also increasing their ability to tie the price employees pay for health insurance for participating in these programs and meeting specific health goals. Yet despite ACA's specific alteration of three different statues which had in the past shielded employees from having to contribute to the cost of their health insurance based on their achieving employer-designated health markers, it chose to leave alone recently enacted rules implementing the Genetic Non-Discrimination Act (GINA), which prohibits employers from asking employees about their family health history in any context, including assessing their risk for setting wellness targets. This article reviews how both the changes made by ACA and the restrictions recently put place by GINA will affect the way employers are likely to structure Wellness Programs. It also considers how these changes reflect the competing social goals of both ACA, which seeks to expand access to the population by lowering costs, and GINA, which seeks to protect individuals from discrimination. It does so by analyzing both positive theories about how these new laws will function and normative theories explaining the likelihood of future friction between the interests of the population of the United States as a whole who are in need of increased and affordable access to health care, and of the individuals living in this country who risk discrimination, as science and medicine continue to make advances in linking genetic make-up to risk of future illness. © 2011 American Society of Law, Medicine & Ethics, Inc."

This paper examines the costs of a chronic disease management program among newly insured adults with diabetes and/or hypertension. Research Design and Methods: Low-income adults with diabetes and/or hypertension were provided County-sponsored health insurance coverage and access to disease management. Health econometric methods were used to compare costs among participants in disease management to nonparticipants, both overall and in comparison between those who were newly insured versus previously insured under an alternative County-sponsored insurance product. Costs were also compared between those who qualified for County-sponsored coverage due to diabetes versus hypertension. Results: Annual inpatient costs were $1260 lower, and outpatient costs were $723 greater, among participants in disease management (P<0.001 each). Participants in disease management without previous County-sponsored coverage had higher pharmacy costs ($154, P=0.002) than nonparticipants; whereas participants with diabetes had marginally significant lower overall costs compared with nonparticipants ($-685, P=0.070). Conclusions: Disease management was successful in increasing the use of outpatient services among participants. The offsetting costs of the program suggest that disease management should be considered for some newly insured populations, especially for adults with diabetes. © 2011 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins."

Design: A prospective study in which dispensed and returned prescription data for Medicare Part D residents encompassing the first six months of 2010 were provided by eight long-term care pharmacies servicing approximately 33,700 residents in 425 facilities. Setting: Nursing facilities. Patients: Residents covered by Medicare Part D. Main Outcome Measures: Unused medication as a percentage of dispensed prescriptions was calculated based on the number of returned prescriptions and the cost of unused medication for all dosage forms and for solid oral forms. Results: For all dosage forms, 6.8% of dispensed prescriptions were returned partially used, representing 3.5% of dispensed cost. For solid oral dosage forms, 6.1% of all dispensed prescriptions were returned partially used, representing 2.9% ± 1% of total dispensed cost. For returned oral solid prescriptions, 24% had a dispensed cost of $50 or more but accounted for 84% of the cost of returned medications; 26% had a unit cost of $1 of more, but accounted for 83% of the cost. The total amount of unconsumed solid oral medication for Medicare Part D residents in skilled nursing facilities was estimated at $125 million annually. Conclusion: The estimated cost of unconsumed medications dispensed to Medicare Part D residents in nursing facilities is approximately 3% of dispensed cost, amounting to approximately $125 million across all U.S. nursing facilities. © 2011 American Society of Consultant Pharmacists, Inc.

Variations in dentists'provision of services have been documented, but information about contributing factors is limited. Methods. The authors used responses to a 2003 survey of general dentists in private practice in California (46 percent response rate; 3,098 dentists included in the final sample) to assess variations in service provision and its correlates. They used logistic regressions to assess the correlation of various characteristics with the self-reported percentage of time spent providing services. Results. The results show variations in services provided by general dentists in private practice. Multiple factors, including the dentist's sex, region of practice, employment of hygienists, patients' race and population income in the area of practice were significantly and independently associated with provision of services. Conclusions. The survey results reflect practice variations that existed before the latest economic downturn, which resulted in a loss of jobs and medical and dental insurance.

Despite the high cost, evidence demonstrates that these patients receive health care of inadequate quality, characterized by fragmentation, overuse, medical errors, and poor quality of life. Methods: This article examines data demonstrating the impact of the U.S. health care system on clinical care outcomes and costs for the sickest and most vulnerable patients. It also defines palliative care and hospice, synthesizes studies of the outcomes of palliative care and hospice services, reviews variables predicting access to palliative care and hospice services, and identifies those policy priorities necessary to strengthen access to high-quality palliative care. Findings: Palliative care and hospice services improve patient-centered outcomes such as pain, depression, and other symptoms; patient and family satisfaction; and the receipt of care in the place that the patient chooses. Some data suggest that, compared with the usual care, palliative care prolongs life. By helping patients get the care they need to avoid unnecessary emergency department and hospital stays and shifting the locus of care to the home or community, palliative care and hospice reduce health care spending for America's sickest and most costly patient populations. Conclusions: Policies focused on enhancing the palliative care workforce, investing in the field's science base, and increasing the availability of services in U.S. hospitals and nursing homes are needed to ensure equitable access to optimal care for seriously ill patients and those with multiple chronic conditions. © 2011 Milbank Memorial Fund.

Specifically, we found that payments made privately, such as those for health insurance or out-of-pocket spending for care, and publicly, through taxes and tax expenditures, consumed more than 20 percent of family income for families in the lowest-income quintile but no more than 16 percent for families in any other income quintile.

Policymakers require current graduate medical education (GME) residency finance data to design and implement programs that increase primary care physicians. The University of Washington Family Medicine Network residencies have collaborated for 10 years in collecting and comparing data regarding the revenues and expenses of their training programs. Based on biennial survey results from 2000 to 2010, this study examines changes in the finances of residency training over a decade using a standardized methodology. Methods: Data were systematically collected by standardized questionnaire, evaluated for quality and verified, and then analyzed. Results: The per-resident expense of residency education for these programs increased an average of 63%, and overall residency revenues increased 75%. GME funding per resident increased 47% but decreased as proportionate contribution to overall program revenue. Conclusions: The mean cost per resident remained relatively stable over the 10-year period, with a 3.1% overall increase to $27,260 per resident per year. Programs that successfully obtained federally qualified health center (FQHC) status, increased their residency graduate medical education (GME) slots or received other new significant funding, such as state grants, were the most financially stable. Policy solutions would stabilize both federal GME and state Medicaid GME funding and increase reimbursement of primary care practice to maintain the viability of primary care training programs."

Both in Great Britain and in the United States market-lead capitalist economic system is established. Although it may be supposed that similarly to other sectors, market coordination should form the basis of the organization of health care, we show that since the basic principles of market coordination are violated with respect to the health care sector, namely there is a lack of perfect competition, complete market, perfect information and market failures may be present, a health care governed purely by market coordination is inherently headed toward failure. In Great Britain this turn was witnessed at the time of the Second World War when the Beverage Committee articulated its recommendations. This set the foundation of the current health care system organized by the National Health Service, as it contained recommendations to finance health care from taxes, to extend coverage to everyone and to place the infrastructure of hospitals into the property of the government. By this a fully government financed health care sector was established. On the other hand the failure of the United States' market-led individually insured private health care system only became apparent in the 1960s, by generating social problems that mandated the need for government intervention. Thus the systems of Medicaid and Medicare were established to provide health care for the poor and the elderly. As a result of the reforms of the past years the convergence of these systems may be witnessed, the system of Great Britain moved toward a more market-oriented approach, while the role of governmental interventions increased in the United States as it is expressed in the Affordable Care Act moved by President Obama. Upon comparing the two systems we also describe the peculiarities of the Hungarian health care system, and we try to draft the possible scope of interventions that could lead to a more sustainable health care system."

Overall funding for these substance abuse services should increase, and they should be better integrated into the mainstream of general health care.

The effects of this historic reform on the delivery of healthcare and on the economy are subject to speculation. While most people are at least generally aware that access to medical care will be improved in many ways, few people, including many in the dental profession, are aware that this legislation also addresses oral health disparities and access to dental care. It is the purpose of this paper to review how dental care is currently accessed in the United States and where oral health care disparities exist, to suggest approaches to alleviating these disparities and to delineate how the changes in dental policies found in the PPACA hope to address these concerns. The main arguments of organized dentistry, both those in support of and in opposition to the PPACA, are summarized."

This paper draws on quantitative and qualitative research to evaluate the extent to which health reforms in Massachusetts, a model for the Affordable Care Act of 2010, have reduced disparities in insurance coverage and access to health care. We found that rates of coverage and the likelihood of having a usual provider increased dramatically for Massachusetts Hispanics after the state's reforms, but disparities remained. The increase in insurance coverage among Hispanics was more than double that experienced by non-Hispanic whites. Even so, in 2009, 78.9 percent of Hispanics had coverage, versus 96 percent of non-Hispanic whites. Language and other cultural factors remained significant barriers: Only 66.6 percent of Hispanics with limited proficiency in English were insured. One-third of Spanish-speaking Hispanics still did not have a personal provider in 2009, and 26.8 percent reported not seeing a doctor because of cost, up from 18.9 percent in 2005.

These organizations will be eligible to share in the savings to Medicare if they are able to reduce costs and provide high-quality care. The law allows a wide variety of organizations to become ACOs, even networks of providers that are small compared with major integrated delivery networks. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services recently proposed regulations, which are extensive and complex. They impose significant regulatory requirements on these new organizations, ranging from the structure of the organization to quality standards for qualifying for any shared savings. There are a number of challenges to ACOs and it is uncertain whether they can achieve the goals Congress had in mind or even whether many healthcare provider organizations will be interested in participating in the program. The potential for shared savings may be too small to justify the additional costs and regulatory burdens of becoming an ACO. In addition, the incentives to physicians may be inadequate to encourage behavior that reduces cost while maintaining quality. The article reviews the proposed regulations and discusses the prospects for success of ACOs."

The objective is to hold provider groups accountable for the quality and cost of care to a population. The financial models for providers generally build off of shared savings between the payers and providers or some type of global payment that includes the possibility of partial or full capitation. For ACOs to achieve the same outcomes with lower costs or, better yet, improved outcomes with the same or lower costs, the delivery system will need to become more oriented toward primary care and care coordination than is currently the case. Providers of clinical services, in order to be more effective, efficient, and coordinated, will need to be supported by a variety of shared services, such as off-hours care, easy access to specialties, and information exchanges. These services can be organized by an ACO as a medical neighborhood or community. Hospitals, because they have a management structure, history of developing programs and services, and accessibility 24/7/365, are logical leaders of this enhancement of health care delivery for populations and other providers."

To investigate the perspectives of resident physicians, in otolaryngology and other specialties, with respect to various health care reform proposals. Also, to determine if these opinions vary between residents training to become general medical doctors versus surgeons and specialists and between those with various levels of educational debt. Study Design and Participants. Survey of resident physicians across the United States. Methods. Opinions of participants were measured on a 5-point Likert scale. Results. Of the 1576 respondents, the majority agreed that tort reform and electronic medical records would improve quality of care and help contain health care costs. However, few residents agreed that bundling of services (BOS), hospitalacquired conditions penalties (HACP), and quality-based reimbursement (QBR) would improve the quality of care. Specialists and surgeons, in comparison to generalists, were (1) less likely to agree that BOS, HACP, or QBR would improve the quality of care; (2) more likely to agree that tort reform would help contain health care costs; and (3) more likely to believe that BOS, HACP, or QBR would decrease physician compensation. Higher educational debt burden was also an independent predictor of increased skepticism about health care reforms effects on physician compensation. Conclusions. Residents in general medicine and surgery/specialty training programs agreed that tort reform and electronic medical records would help improve the quality of health care and help contain costs. However, both groups expressed strong concern that certain elements of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act would not achieve these goals. © American Academy of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery Foundation 2011."

Ever since its inception, IPAB has been one of the most controversial issues of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), even though the powers of IPAB are restricted and multiple sectors of health care have been protected in the law. IPAB works by recommending policies to Congress to help Medicare provide better care at a lower cost, which would include ideas on coordinating care, getting rid of waste in the system, providing incentives for best practices, and prioritizing primary care. Congress then has the power to accept or reject these recommendations. However, Congress faces extreme limitations, either to enact policies that achieve equivalent savings, or let the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) follow IPAB's recommendations. IPAB has strong supporters and opponents, leading to arguments in favor of or against to the extreme of introducing legislation to repeal IPAB. The origins of IPAB are found in the ideology of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) and the impetus of exploring health care costs, even though IPAB's authority seems to be limited to Medicare only. The structure and operation of IPAB differs from Medicare and has been called the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) on steroids. The board membership consists of 15 full-time members appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate with options for recess appointments. The IPAB statute sets target growth rates for Medicare spending. The applicable percent for maximum savings appears to be 0.5% for year 2015, 1% for 2016, 1.25% for 2017, and 1.5% for 2018 and later. The IPAB Medicare proposal process involves mandatory recommendations and advisory recommendations with multiple reporting requirements. However, although IPAB has been described as having limited authority, some believe that it has unlimited authority due to the lack of judicial review and the requirement of twothirds of the Congress to override any recommendations by IPAB."

For example, support for the public insurance option, which was not included in the final version of the Affordable Care Act, ranged from 46.5 percent to 64.6 percent depending on how pollsters worded their questions.

In 2010-11, newly revised guidelines for screening and preventive services have been issued by the US Preventive Services Task Force and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In addition to these guidelines and the landmark changes in Medicare coverage, there are significant new attempts to modify national screening recommendations based on age and expected risk/benefit for older adults. These population-specific guidelines with new emphasis on functional status and multiple risk factor reduction are of increasing importance to an aging population, where more conventional disease-focused guidelines are less suitable for maintaining physical function and quality of life.

However, less is known about the cause of this variation, or about whether increased spending is associated with better outcomes. In this article we describe and analyze sources of interstate variation in Medicaid spending over several years. We find substantial variations both in the volume of services and in prices. Overall, per capita spending in the ten highest-spending states was $1,650 above the average national per capita spending, of which $1,186, or 72 percent, was due to the volume of services delivered. Spending in the ten lowest-spending states was $1,161 below the national average, of which $672, or 58 percent, was due to volume. In the mid-Atlantic region, increased price and volume resulted in the most expensive care among regions, whereas reduced price and volume in the South Central region resulted in the least expensive care among regions.

The potential impact of national healthcare reform may be considered using a similar set of state-level reforms including exchanges and a mandate, enacted in 2006 in Massachusetts. Purpose: To evaluate the effects of reforms on healthcare access, affordability, and disparities. Design: Interrupted time series with comparison series. Setting/participants: Longitudinal survey data from 2002 to 2009 from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System including 178,040 nonelderly adults residing in Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Connecticut. Analysis was conducted from January to August 2010. Intervention: Massachusetts 2006 healthcare reform, which included an individual health insurance mandate. Main outcome measures: Being uninsured, having no personal doctor, and forgoing care because of cost, evaluated in Massachusetts and four comparison states before (20022005) and after (20072009) the healthcare reform. Effects on disparities defined by race, education, income, and employment also were assessed. Results: Living in Massachusetts in 2009 was associated with a 7.6 percentage point (95% CI=3.9, 11.3) higher probability of being insured; 4.8 percentage point (0.9, 10.6) lower probability of forgoing care because of cost; and a 6.6 percentage point (1.9, 11.3) higher probability of having a personal doctor, compared to expected levels in the absence of reform, defined by trends in control states and adjusting for socioeconomic factors. The effects of the reform on insurance coverage attenuated from 2008 to 2009. In a socioeconomically disadvantaged group, the reforms had a greater effect in improving outcomes on the absolute but not relative scale. Conclusions: Healthcare reforms in Massachusetts, which included a health insurance mandate, were associated with significant increases in insurance coverage and access. The absolute effects of the reform were greater for disadvantaged populations. This is important evidence to consider as debate over national healthcare reform continues. © 2011 American Journal of Preventive Medicine."

Recently, the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) proposed an alternative explanation of hospital pricing and profitability that could be used to support policies that pressure hospitals to reduce overall costs rather than to only raise prices. This study evaluated the cost-shift and MedPAC perspectives using 2008 data on hospital margins for 30,514 Medicare and privately insured patients undergoing any of seven major procedures in markets where robust hospital competition exists and in markets where hospital care is concentrated in the hands of a few providers. The study presents empirical evidence that, faced with shortfalls between Medicare payments and projected costs, hospitals in concentrated markets focus on raising prices to private insurers, while hospitals in competitive markets focus on cutting costs.

We measured children's access to outpatient specialty care to identify disparities in providers' acceptance of Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) versus private insurance. METHODS: Between January and May 2010, research assistants called a stratified, random sample of clinics representing eight specialties in Cook County, Illinois, which has a high proportion of specialists. Callers posed as mothers of pediatric patients with common health conditions requiring outpatient specialty care. Two calls, separated by 1 month, were placed to each clinic by the same person with the use of a standardized clinical script that differed by insurance status. RESULTS: We completed 546 paired calls to 273 specialty clinics and found significant disparities in provider acceptance of Medicaid-CHIP versus private insurance across all tested specialties. Overall, 66% of Medicaid-CHIP callers (179 of 273) were denied an appointment as compared with 11% of privately insured callers (29 of 273) (relative risk, 6.2; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.3 to 8.8; P<0.001). Among 89 clinics that accepted both insurance types, the average wait time for Medicaid - CHIP enrollees was 22 days longer than that for privately insured children (95% CI, 6.8 to 37.5; P = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: We found a disparity in access to outpatient specialty care between children with public insurance and those with private insurance. Policy interventions that encourage providers to accept patients with public insurance are needed to improve access to care. Copyright © 2011 Massachusetts Medical Society. All rights reserved."

The new health care social contract reflects a ""fair share"" approach to health care financing. This approach largely rejects the actuarial fairness vision of what constitutes a fair share while pointing toward a new responsibility to be as healthy as you can. This new responsibility reflects the influence of health economics and health ethics. There are challenges to achieving the solidarity through individual responsibility envisioned in the Act - most significantly ""risk classification by design"" and non-compliance with the mandates - but the Act contains regulatory tools that the states, the new Exchanges, and the Department of Health and Human Services can use to address these challenges. This Article provides a high level overview of the distribution of health insurance risk and responsibility after the Affordable Care Act and describes how the Act reforms the key institutions that perform that distribution: Medicare, Medicaid, the large-group health insurance market, and the individual and small-group health insurance market."

American health scholars, politicians, and the public at large answer this question ambivalently. This Article defines three dominant conceptions of health insurance that weave throughout popular and academic discourse and that echoed in the 2010 health reform debates. The first conception is that health insurance should primarily serve to mitigate harms to health. This ""Health Promotion"" theory relies on using health insurance to pay for medical care that most cost-effectively preserves and improves health. Alternately, health insurance might primarily mitigate risks to wealth from high medical care costs. This ""Financial Security"" theory demands that health insurance limit financial insecurity from these costs. Finally, the ""Brute Luck"" theory, highly sensitive to the possibility of adverse-incentive effects arising from moral hazard, demands that health insurance protect primarily against unavoidable or ""chance"" health risks that do not arise from individual behavior. This last theory thus seeks to preserve incentives for insureds to prevent risk themselves, while insurance neutralizes harms from random poor health. Each theory implies distinct principles to guide premium pricing and allocation of premium dollars toward medical care. The new health reform law, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (PPACA), manifests this ""conceptual pluralism."" It evokes all three of these notions of the types of risks Americans should share - now more collectively post-reform - through insurance. While the goals of these three theories dovetail at times (e.g., promoting health will in some cases also reduce medical care costs), at other times they are at odds. Conceptual pluralism thus complicates implementation of PPACA as regulators must manage tensions and make tradeoffs among these goals. The framework offered in this Article is important for two reasons. First, creating a roadmap to understand the different conceptions of insurance, and the values that inform them, brings awareness to the root cause of tensions that will arise as PPACA is implemented. Second, this framework elucidates the different ends that health insurance could serve and thus enables clearer future reflection and debate on what ends it should serve and to what degree."

Using the 2007 California Health Interview Survey (CHIS 2007), this policy brief estimates that of the 1.08 million children in California who were uninsured all or part of the year, between 180,000 to 220,000 will be excluded from the health care reform expansions due to the combined direct and potential indirect effects of these exclusions.

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, also called ACA for short, impacts physician professional practice dramatically. Physicians are paid in the USA for their personal services. The payment system is highly variable in the private insurance market; however, governmental systems have a formula based payment, mostly based on the Medicare payment system. Physician services are billed under part B. The Neurointerventional practice is typically performed in a hospital setting. The VA system is a frequently cited successful implementation of a government supported health care program. Availability of neurointerventional services at many VA medical centers is limited. Since the inception of the Medicare program in 1965, several methods have been used to determine the amounts paid to physicians for each covered service. Initially, the payment systems compensated physicians on the basis of their charges. In 1975, just over 10 years after the inception of the Medicare program, payments changed so as not to exceed the increase in medical economic index. The involvement of medical economic index failed to curb increases in costs, leading to the determination of a yearly change in fees by legislation from 1984 to 1991. In 1992, the fee schedule essentially replaced the prior payment system that was based on the physician's charges, which also failed to curb the growth in spending. Thus, in 1998, the sustainable growth rate system was introduced. In 2009, multiple unsuccessful attempts were made by Congress to repeal the formula. The mechanism of the sustainable growth rate includes three components that are incorporated into a statutory formula: expenditure targets, growth rate period and annual adjustments of payment rates for physician services."

These challenges are: predominance of small group practices, dominant fee-for-service reimbursement methods, weaknesses of the traditional hospital medical staff structure and a need to partner with commercial insurance companies. APP has demonstrated teamwork between 3800 physicians and hospitals to improve quality, patient safety and cost-effectiveness. Building on this model, an innovative contract with Blue Cross Blue Shield of Illinois serves as a prototype for a commercial Accountable Care Organization. For this contract to succeed, APP must outperform the market competition. To accomplish this, APP has implemented strategies to reduce readmissions, avoid unnecessary admissions and emergency room visits, expand primary care access, and enhance quality and patient safety."

Addressing these costs will therefore be an important component in making the U.S. health care system more financially sustainable. In this paper, we explore the moral justifications for having discussions of end-of-life costs in the doctor-patient encounter as part of an effort to control costs. As health care costs are partly shared through pooled resources, such as insurance and taxation, and partly borne by individuals through out-of-pocket expenses, we separate our defense for, and approach to, discussing both pooled and individual aspects of cost. We argue that there needs to be a shift away from formulating the options as a dichotomous choice of paying attention to end-of-life costs versus ignoring such costs. The question should be how personal costs will be managed and how societal expenditures should be allocated. These are issues that we believe patients care about and need to have addressed in a manner with which they are comfortable. Conversations about how money will be spent at the end of life should begin before the end is near. We propose discussing costs from the onset of chronic illness and incorporating financial issues in advance care planning. Through these approaches one can avoid abruptly and insensitively introducing financial issues at the very conclusion of a person's life when one would prefer to address the painful and important issues of spiritual and existential loss that are appropriately the focus when a person is dying. © 2011 American Society of Law, Medicine & Ethics, Inc."

This is reflected in the discourse surrounding health literacy, which is viewed as an important tool for achieving all three goals. Health literacy refers to one's ability to obtain, understand and use health information to make appropriate health decisions. Research shows that improving patients' health literacy can help overcome access barriers and empower patients to be better health care partners, which should lead to better health outcomes. Promoting health literacy can also reduce expenditures for unnecessary or inappropriate treatment. This explains why, as a policy matter, improving health literacy is an objective that has been embraced by almost every sector of the health care system. As a legal matter, however, the role of health literacy in ensuring quality and access is not as prominent. Although the health literacy movement is relatively young, it has roots in longstanding bioethical principles of patient autonomy, beneficence, and justice as well as the corresponding legal principles of informed consent, the right to quality care, and antidiscrimination. Assumptions and concerns about health literacy seem to do important, yet subtle work in these legal doctrines--influencing conclusions about patient understanding in informed consent cases, animating decisions about patient responsibility in malpractice cases, and underlying regulatory guidance concerning the quality of language assistance services that are necessary for meaningful access to care. Nonetheless, health literacy is not explicitly treated as a legally relevant factor in these doctrines. Moreover, there is no coherent legal framework for incorporating health literacy research that challenges traditional assumptions about patient comprehension and decision-making, and that emphasizes the need for providers to improve communication and take affirmative steps to assess patient understanding. The absence of a clear and robust consideration of health literacy in these doctrines undermines core access and quality aims, and it means that such laws are of limited efficacy in promoting health literacy. Returning to the theme that the health literacy problem reflects a complementary view of access, quality and cost, it is likely that the cost implications of this problem (and not concerns about quality and access) will motivate the kind of health literacy reform that may ultimately strengthen existing quality and access standards. One recent example of this can be seen in reforms linked to government, insurer and provider attempts to reduce costly medication errors."

However, rapidly rising health care costs could thwart that effort. Since 1988 Intermountain Healthcare has applied to health care delivery the insights of W. Edwards Deming's process management theory, which says that the best way to reduce costs is to improve quality. Intermountain achieved such quality-based savings through measuring, understanding, and managing variation among clinicians in providing care. Intermountain created data systems and management structures that increased accountability, drove improvement, and produced savings. For example, a new delivery protocol helped reduce rates of elective induced labor, unplanned cesarean sections, and admissions to newborn intensive care units. That one protocol saves an estimated $50 million in Utah each year. If applied nationally, it would save about $3.5 billion.

This has not been the case with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) of 2010. The essays in this section help us make sense of the ACA's impact on future politics. By focusing on the first six months after the bill's adoption, Rogan Kersh investigates the politics surrounding the ACA's implementation, addressing three aspects: first, the balance of those working toward gridlock versus a federal agency intent on efficient and swift implementation; second, an ardent move by some to repeal all or part of the ACA; and third, dwindling public support for the ACA in addition to a lack of ability or interest by supporters to continue working for reform. While these three factors suggest a volatile political climate immediately following passage, Lawrence R. Jacobs's essay encourages us to think about the longer-term implications of how the ACA will foster a new politics. Jacobs reminds us of the old adage, ""policy effects politics,"" and gives us a glimpse into the ACA's possible effects. © 2011 by Duke University Press."

Because it requires significant departures from business as usual in health insurance, health care delivery, and health behavior, PPACA is unlikely to succeed unless Americans feel a shared stake in its success. Unfortunately, the new law has been branded only by its opponents. Neither the Obama Administration nor its congressional allies have effectively communicated the law's key elements to the public. Most surprisingly, the groundbreaking program of near-universal health coverage that PPACA creates does not have a name. This Article explores the process of branding major American social legislation such as PPACA and suggests a strategy for improving public understanding and building loyalty. Legal brand equity, like its commercial counterpart, implies a functional, emotional, and expressive relationship between the law and its intended beneficiaries. Accordingly, an effective marketing strategy for PPACA entails creating consistent expectations regarding the law's goals and performance, and ensuring that those expectations are met."

Is this reform truly historic? Is it a big-bang reform or classic American incrementalism, building slowly and persistently on the existing system? Are there clear historical roots in this reform, and are there parts of the ACA that will potentially take the United States in a new direction? These are the questions addressed by the essays in this section. James A. Morone provides a broad historical look and shows us how social insurance, Lockean liberalism, a broken Congress, and our need for a neo-Progressive technical fix have shaped the U.S. health care system and this particular reform. Kimberly J. Morgan and Andrea Louise Campbell explain how the ACA is yet another example of the American penchant for delegated governance. Although technical feasibility and efficiency are often used to explain this preference, Morgan and Campbell show how classic liberal views for minimal government and interest-group mobilization are at the root of our reliance on delegation. Marie Gottschalk helps us understand why Democrats abandoned the movement for a single-payer system in lieu of a public option. She examines why this approach failed, as well as its costs and implications. In a response to the hyperbolic descriptions above, I then demonstrate how the ACA is neither extreme government takeover nor private privilege but is consistent with an established pattern of building up the U.S. health care state through investments in private provision and infrastructure, then hiding such investments from view.

How did this reform pass when so many other attempts have failed? Political scientists Lawrence D. Brown, Mark A. Peterson, and Jacob S. Hacker each offer conceptual frameworks for understanding the passage of the ACA. From these, we turn to essays that examine particular factors that influenced the passage of the ACA. Joseph White focuses on the legislative need to build a Democratic coalition and the political dangers of accommodating the median legislator - in this case, the Blue Dog Democrats. Jill Quadagno examines the multifaceted role of interest groups in shaping the ACA. James Brasfield considers the evolution of the public option in the larger politics of health reform. Federalism, as that ever-important institution in U.S. health care policy, has been no less important in shaping the passage of the ACA. Michael S. Sparer shows us how intergovernmental politics interacted with interest-group politics, political culture, and institutional gridlock as various bills wound their way through Congress, leading to the ultimate passage of the ACA. Scott L. Greer considers the role of states under the ACA and argues that this new framework - increased federal financing and regulation combined with substantial state flexibility - has the potential to be a dramatic improvement over the status quo. That improvement, however, will depend on intergovernmental politics and states' willingness to participate. © 2011 by Duke University Press."

CER compares competing treatments against each other to determine which interventions work best, supplying critical information for medical decisionmaking and health policy. If CER works as planned, it may be one of the few reform measures in the final health care legislation that could flatten the cost curve while also improving quality. Unfortunately, health care reform has so far failed to bet smart and play the CER wild card effectively. While the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act invests in CER at record levels and creates an entirely new regulatory framework for oversight of the research, the new law does very little to advance the difficult work of translating CER into actual medical practice. First, CER is costly to conduct and its data often raise more questions than answers. Second, the government's CER agenda seems vague and ill-defined, not consistently focusing on generating research that will help clinicians resolve immediate treatment questions. Third, and most important, physicians likely will remain indifferent to and ""tune out"" CER. Health law and policy are not setting the right incentives for physicians to adapt their practice patterns to CER and, in some respects, exacerbate the physician-engagement difficulties. The reasons for physician indifference to CER include: lack of financial incentives, suspicions of industry bias in the public/private oversight of the research, threats to clinical autonomy, a commitment to individualized medicine (encouraged by health law, professional ethics, and medical norms) that remains in tension with CER, concerns that CER is a vehicle for crude cost-cutting, and malpractice liability fears. To be truly effective, the new national CER program requires targeted reforms designed to engage physicians more directly with the research. This Article's principal suggestions include greater linkage of CER with reimbursement and liability incentives, enhanced use of academic detailing, and more support for comparative implementation studies that evaluate different strategies for fostering physician uptake of CER."

Regulatory policy then becomes an ongoing contest between the public and private sectors, infusing policy debates with a sense that it is necessary to choose between them. On closer examination, this duality is false. On a fundamental level, free-market entrepreneurs and government regulators are not opponents, but are, on the contrary, partners in a common enterprise. Across a range of major industries, one party could not exist without the other. In no industry is this interplay more important than in health care. A series of government programs, most initiated during the latter half of the twentieth century, literally created the health care system as it exists in the United States today. Hospitals grew to their present size and technological complexity because of funding provided by the Hill-Burton Act and Medicare. Medicare also funds physician training, as well as reimbursement for many physician-provided services. Pharmaceutical manufacturers rely on the National Institutes of Health to support basic biomedical research that leads to the development of new drugs. A huge tax subsidy for employer-sponsored coverage finances, in large part, the health insurance industry. Without these programs, none of these health care industry segments could have approached its present size or vitality. To ignore this dynamic is to ignore the true nature of American health care and to fundamentally misunderstand the opportunities for reform. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) continues and extends this paradigm. It will expand coverage in large part by facilitating broader demand for individual policies, which will revitalize private insurance markets. It will also extend Medicaid, a program that in most states is administered by private managed care plans, to millions more beneficiaries. Far from representing a government takeover or novel incursion into the health care system, PPACA extends the underlying arrangement that has built and sustains the structure of American health care as it exists today. In the American health care system, private innovation and government intervention represent not opposing forces, but rather partners in a common enterprise."

The development of PCORI is vested in the Medicare Modernization Act (MMA) and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). The framework of CER and PCORI describes multiple elements which are vested in all 3 regulations including stakeholder involvement, public participation, and open transparent decision-making process. Overall, PCORI is much more elaborate with significant involvement of stakeholders, transparency, public participation, and open decision-making. However, there are multiple issues concerning the operation of such agencies in the United States including the predecessor of Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), the Agency for Healthcare Policy and Research (AHCPR), AHRQ Effectiveness Health Care programs, and others. The CER in the United States may be described at cross-roads or at the beginnings of a scientific era of CER and evidence-based medicine (EBM). However the United States suffers as other countries, including the United Kingdom with its National Health Services (NHS) and National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), with major misunderstandings of methodology, an inordinate focus on methodological assessment, lack of understanding of the study design (placebo versus active control), lack of involvement of clinicians, and misinterpretation of the evidence which continues to be disseminated. Consequently, PCORI and CER have been described as government-driven solutions without following the principles of EBM with an extensive focus on costs rather than quality. It also has been stated that the central planning which has been described for PCORI and CER, a term devised to be acceptable, will be used by third party payors to override the physician's best medical judgement and patient's best interest. Further, stakeholders in PCORI are not scientists, are not balanced, and will set an agenda with an ultimate problem of comparative effectiveness and PCORI that it is not based on medical science, but rather on political science and not even under congressional authority, leading to unprecedented negative changes to health care. Thus, PCORI is operating in an ad hoc manner that is incompatible with the principles of evidence-based practice.

A potential disadvantage of preserving many sources of health insurance is the likelihood of abrupt changes in coverage or financial responsibility when individual circumstances change. This brief describes four policy challenges related to such changes: adjusting premium and cost-sharing subsidies when incomes change; coordinating eligibility for premium credits, Medicaid, and the Children's Health Insurance Program; encouraging and facilitating continuous coverage; and minimizing transitions between individual and small-business exchanges. Policy recommendations to reduce uncertainty, simplify coverage decisions, and minimize insurance transitions include extending coverage to the open enrollment period at the end of the year, generous treatment of income gains in correcting premium tax credits, and unifying the small-business and individual exchanges."

However, several indicators show poorer access to care for those who are uninsured. The characteristics of the Exchange-eligible with subsidies are likely to change by 2014 when the major provisions of the ACA are implemented.

Immunization against potentially life-threatening illnesses for children and adults has proved to be one of the great public health successes of the 20th century and is extremely cost-effective. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act includes a number of provisions to increase coverage and access to immunizations for the consumer, including a provision for health plans to cover all Advisory Committee on Immunization Practicesrecommended vaccines at first dollar, or without cost sharing. In this study, we examined payers' perspectives on first-dollar coverage of vaccines and strategies to improve vaccination rates. Methods. This was a qualitative study, using a literature review and semistructured expert interviews with payers. Results. Four key themes emerged, including (1) the cost implications of the first-dollar change; (2) the importance of examining barriers to children, adolescents, and adults separately to focus interventions more strategically; (3) the importance of provider knowledge and education in increasing immunization; and (4) the effect of first-dollar coverage on those who decline vaccination for personal reasons. Conclusions. We determined that, while reducing financial barriers through first-dollar coverage is an important first step to increasing immunization rates, there are structural and cultural barriers that also will require collaborative, strategic work among all vaccine stakeholders. © 2011 Association of Schools of Public Health."

Quality metrics have been in development for years (by private and governmental sectors), and momentum is growing. The purpose of this commentary is to explore quality changes in the way practicing obstetricians and gynecologists will be held accountable for quality service. Two new options being explored for health care, both focusing on improving quality and physician metrics, include value-based purchasing and accountable-care organizations. Both will likely consist of universal clinical algorithms and cost monitoring as measures. For obstetrics this will probably include physician's rates of cesarean deliveries and elective inductions. For gynecology this may comprise of indications for hysterectomy with documented failed medical management, minor surgical management, or both medical and minor surgical management. It is anticipated patients will no longer be able to request obstetric testing, pregnancy induction, or hysterectomy. It is imperative we, as obstetrician-gynecologists, are involved in health care reform that inevitably involves the care of women.

Over the past 50 years there have been many public policy victories and enormous advances in children's health and health care. Many of the infectious diseases that were once killing and disabling children are now largely prevented or controlled by vaccines and antibiotics. Because of public policy actions by APA in conjunction with other child advocacy organizations, there are now protections for children from some environmental toxins, such as lead. Injury and poison prevention have advanced because of APA advocacy. The APA has also been a consistent advocate for children's access to high-quality health services and has seen some progress in this realm over the past 5 decades. Members have vocally defended legislation that supports health professional training, which has resulted in successful training programs that encourage the development of the pediatric primary care workforce. Furthermore, members of the APA have been leaders in developing the firm data base establishing the vital importance of health insurance coverage and in disseminating this information broadly.

The authors examined current and predicted sources of insurance coverage and use of mental health services among adults with and without severe mental disorders and modeled postreform changes. Method: The authors obtained sociodemographic, health status, mental health care use, and insurance coverage data from the 2004-2006 Medical Expenditure Panel Surveys to estimate changes that will occur after reform is fully implemented in 2019. Results: Adults with severe mental disorders, identified as self-reported severe depression or other psychological distress, were more likely than those without such disorders to be uninsured (21.0% compared with 16.5%). Only one-fifth of individuals with severe mental disorders who lacked full-year insurance coverage had any mental health service use in the 2004-2006 period, compared with approximately half of those who had coverage. The authors estimate that the expansion of insurance coverage under reform will lead to 1.15 million new users of mental health services, which represents a 4.5% increase. The authors estimate an increase of 2.3 million users of mental health services in Medicaid and nearly 2 million in private insurance. Conclusions: Public insurance programs that currently play a major role in financing mental health services will play an even greater role after reform is implemented. Significant increases can be expected both in the overall number of users of mental health services and in their resources to pay for care. Copyright © 2011 American Psychiatric Association.

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is expected to leave twenty-three million people uninsured after a decade. And until several major provisions take effect in 2014, fifty million people will remain uninsured. This Article argues that cross-border health insurance plans that utilize foreign medical providers are a surprisingly feasible alternative for the residually uninsured. Cross-border plans can be much less expensive than traditional, domestic-only plans. And they might appeal to immigrants and others that are neither eligible for public plans nor able to afford private ones. The Article begins by evaluating the 2010 health reform legislation and the populations that it leaves out. I then reveal how gaps in our health care system are being filled by foreign medical providers. Three major constituents of the U.S. health care system now utilize foreign providers: patients travel as ""medical tourists"" when they cannot afford care domestically; insurers outsource high-margin procedures to foreign hospitals; and somewhat perversely, some U.S. hospitals facing extraordinary expenses repatriate immigrants to their native countries in a form of international ""patient dumping."" These trends reflect what I call the ""new geography"" of health care. The Article demonstrates how cross-border plans might appeal both to immigrants and to the nonimmigrant middle class that cannot afford traditional insurance. I explain how cross-border plans operate and propose various solutions to the legal and practical impediments that presently discourage such arrangements. For example, the Article applies ""new governance"" theories to recommend how to impose quality standards on foreign providers that otherwise reside beyond the jurisdiction of domestic regulators. This Article also confronts an underlying normative question: How much should we relax or reconfigure our standards to make health care more accessible?

Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate national and state prevalence of health problems and special health care needs in US children; to estimate health care quality related to adequacy and consistency of insurance coverage, access to specialist, mental health and preventive medical and dental care, developmental screening, and whether children meet criteria for having a medical home, including care coordination and family centeredness; and to assess differences in health and health care quality for children by insurance type, special health care needs status, race/ethnicity, and/or state of residence. Methods: National and state level estimates were derived from the 2007 National Survey of Children's Health (N = 91 642; children aged 0-17 years). Variations between children with public versus private sector health insurance, special health care needs, specific conditions, race/ethnicity, and across states were evaluated using multivariate logistic regression and/or standardized statistical tests. Results: An estimated 43% of US children (32 million) currently have at least 1 of 20 chronic health conditions assessed, increasing to 54.1% when overweight, obesity, or being at risk for developmental delays are included; 19.2% (14.2 million) have conditions resulting in a special health care need, a 1.6 point increase since 2003. Compared with privately insured children, the prevalence, complexity, and severity of health problems were systematically greater for the 29.1% of all children who are publicly insured children after adjusting for variations in demographic and socioeconomic factors. Forty-five percent of all children in the United States scored positively on a minimal quality composite measure: 1) adequate insurance, 2) preventive care visit, and 3) medical home. A 22.2 point difference existed across states and there were wide variations by health condition (autism, 22.8, to asthma, 39.4). After adjustment for demographic and health status differences, quality of care varied between children with public versus private health insurance on all but the following 3 measures: not receiving needed mental health services, care coordination, and performance on the minimal quality composite. A 4.60 fold (gaps in insurance) to 1.27 fold (preventive dental and medical care visits) difference in quality scores was observed across states. Notable disparities were observed among publicly insured children according to race/ethnicity and across all children by special needs status and household income. Conclusions: Findings emphasize the importance of health care insurance duration and adequacy, health care access, chronic condition management, and other quality of care goals reflected in the 2009 CHIPRA legislation and the ACA. Despite disparities, similarities for public and privately insured children speak to the pervasive nature of availability, coverage, and access issues for mental health services in the United States, as well as the system-wide problem of care coordination and accessing specialist care for all children. Variations across states in key areas amenable to state policy and program management support cross-state learning and improvement efforts. © 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

We argue that the adequacy of health insurance coverage should also be assessed in terms of the adequacy of specific benefits coverage and access to care. Underinsurance can be understood conceptually as comprising three separate domains: (a) the economic features of health insurance, (b) the benefits covered, and (c) access to health services. The literature provides ample evidence that people who are underinsured have high financial risk and face barriers in access to care similar to those who are completely uninsured. In response to the growing recognition of the problems associated with underinsurance, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 includes numerous provisions designed to limit costs to consumers, to assure a minimum set of benefits, and to enhance access to care, especially primary care. © 2011 by Annual Reviews. rights reserved."

Drawing from the Consumer Expenditure Survey, the authors assess how much ""room"" people have in their budget, after paying for other necessities, to pay for health care needs. The results show that an overwhelming majority of households have room in their budgets for the necessities, health insurance premiums, and moderate levels of out-of-pocket costs established by the Affordable Care Act. Fewer than 10 percent of families above the federal poverty level do not have the resources to pay for premiums and typical out-of-pocket costs, even with the subsidies provided by the health reform law. Affordability remains a concern for some families with high out-of-pocket spending, suggesting that this is the major risk to insurance affordability."

Some observers, however, are now concerned that benefits standards introduced by federal health care reform will undermine these plans, and many in the business community anticipate new health benefits mandates will drive up employers' total health care costs. The authors show that although the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) of 2010 includes numerous provisions that will likely increase costs for employers, the law also accommodates, and may even foster, HSAs and HRAs."

The CLASS Act is intended to supplement rather than supplant assistance received from other payers. Furthermore, its reliance on a cash benefit allocated by beneficiaries with the assistance of counseling services makes it consistent with the consumer-directed philosophy increasingly favored by the LTC advocacy community. Largely due to inadequate take-up, however, particularly among better than average risks, it is unlikely that implementation of the CLASS Act will fundamentally alter the current public-private partnership for LTC financing. Instead, voluntary enrollment combined with a lack of medical underwriting could lead to disproportionate numbers of high-cost enrollees. This could result in premium increases that further discourage participation on the part of the broader population. Barring making the program mandatory, there are a number of comparatively minor changes policymakers could make to strengthen the risk pool, though doing so will involve a trade-off between attracting better-off risks while eschewing those likely to need the benefit most. Thus, although the CLASS Act may provide a meaningful benefit for those who enroll, its impact on improving the affordability of LTC for most Americans will likely be limited. Most will continue to rely on substantial unpaid care, out-of-pocket payments when formal care is required, and Medicaid when all other money has run out. © The Author 2010.

We conducted a baseline study of California's acute care hospitals just before mandatory reporting of hospital-acquired infection rates to the state began, in 2008. We found variability in many areas: For example, 70.1 percent of hospitals said that they were fully implementing evidence-based guidelines to fight infection by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, but 22.8 percent of hospitals had not adopted any. Our analysis showed that rural hospitals, many of which lack resources to implement needed procedures, faced the greatest challenges in reporting and improving infection rates. Our findings should be of interest to Medicare policy makers who will implement the hospital-acquired infection performance measures in the Affordable Care Act, and to leaders in the thirty-eight states that have enacted legislation requiring reports of hospital-acquired infection rates.

The objective of this study is to assess the current availability and cost of five common antiaddiction medications in the largest federal medication insurance program in the US, Medicare Part D. Methods: In early 2010, we collected coverage and cost data from 41 Medicare Part D prescription drug plans (PDPs) and 45 Medicare Advantage Plans (MAPs) in Washington State. Results: The great majority of Medicare plans (82-100%) covered common pharmacotherapeutic treatments for drug addiction. These Medicare plans typically placed patent protected medications on their highest formulary tiers, leading to relatively high patient co-payments during the initial Part D coverage period. For example, median monthly co-payments for buprenorphine (Suboxone®) were about $46 for PDPs, and about $56 for MAPs. Conclusion: While Medicare prescription plans usually cover pharmacotherapeutic treatments for drug addiction, high co-payments can limit access. For example, beneficiaries without supplemental coverage who use Vivitrol® would exceed their initial coverage cap in 7-8 months, reaching the "" doughnut hole"" in their Part D coverage and becoming responsible for the full cost of the medication (over $900 per month). The 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act will gradually eliminate this coverage gap, and loss of patent protection for other antiaddiction medications (Suboxone® and Campral®) should also drive down patient costs, improving access and compliance. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd."

The uninsured are far more likely than those with health insurance to report problems getting needed medical care, less likely to follow recommended treatments because of costs, have less access to care, receive less preventive care, and are more likely to be hospitalized for avoidable health problems. Moreover, it is widely believed that the uninsured, when they need care, are less able to pay for their care since they do not have health insurance and therefore it is further assumed that other payers take on the financial burden of their care through higher prices. Many Americans obtain their health insurance through employers. Local factors such as local labor market conditions, the mix of firms and firm sizes, and demographic factors such as age, play a role in the proportion of uninsured among those of working age. The Medicare program has effectively provided health insurance to almost all elderly Americans while the Medicaid program and the State Children's Health Insurance Program have expanded health insurance coverage to both the poor and to children. State policies to expand coverage, including implementing Medicaid waivers to expand coverage, account for some of the differences across states in the proportion of uninsureds. Similarly, state policies to expand coverage such as employer or personal mandates to purchase insurance in Hawaii and Massachusetts further explain some of the differences in the number of uninsureds across states. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA, P.L. 111-148, as amended), through an expansion of Medicaid and the creation of state health insurance exchanges, is projected by the Congressional Budget Office to reduce the share of legal non-elderly residents without health insurance to 6% of the population by 2019.

As of 2006, the U.S. IMR was 6.7, compared to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) average of 5.2. The relatively high U.S. rate-and the number of infant deaths it indicates-concerns some policymakers. In addition, there is concern that the U.S. IMR has leveled off after four decades of decline. Reducing the U.S. IMR has been-and continues to be-a recognized public health objective. Researchers and policymakers debate the various factors that may explain the high U.S. IMR relative to other developed countries and its recent stagnation. Potential factors include international differences in the recording of live births, different rates of low birthweight and short gestational age births, and racial and ethnic disparities. Researchers conclude that international recording differences do not explain the relatively high U.S. IMR. In addition, the data suggest that racial disparities may only partially explain the relatively high U.S. IMR. Instead, researchers suggest that higher U.S. rates of low birthweight and short gestational age births may explain the relatively high U.S. IMR. This report examines the U.S. IMR. It identifies the top three causes of U.S. infant death-congenital malformations, disorders related to low birthweight and short gestational age, and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). The report focuses on low birthweight and short gestational age, because the United States has relatively high and increasing rates of these births, and research has found that these births can be reduced through policy interventions. The U.S. IMR varies geographically and is influenced by a number of factors, including the mother's demographic characteristics (e.g., education, income, or age) and health and health system characteristics. In general, southern states have the highest IMRs, and states in the West and in New England have the lowest. The higher IMRs in southern states may be partially explained by higher rates of low birthweight and short gestational age births in these states. In addition, the racial and ethnic composition of a state's population affects its IMR because of higher IMRs among certain racial and ethnic groups. The IMR is also influenced by health and health system characteristics, including the mother's health behaviors, such as drinking and smoking, and her access to and use of prenatal care. A number of federal programs that aim to improve the health status, and the economic and social circumstances, of low-income women and children may reduce the U.S. IMR. These programs include Healthy Start, Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grants, Medicaid, and the State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). Evaluating whether a particular program reduces the IMR is challenging because individuals may be eligible for multiple programs and because programs target those with IMR risk. Given this, it is difficult to determine the effectiveness of a single program, and it is difficult to determine whether findings that a program does not reduce the IMR are due to characteristics of the program or to characteristics of its participants. Recently enacted health reform legislation-the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA, P.L. 111-148)-either establishes or expands existing programs to reduce the IMR. For example, the law includes programs to prevent teen pregnancy and requirements to increase reimbursement for smoking cessation among pregnant women enrolled in Medicaid. © 2011 Nova Scicence Publishers, Inc.

To help address these concerns, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 requires Medicare to experiment with making a bundled payment for a hospitalization plus post-acute care, that is, the recuperative or rehabilitative care following a hospital discharge. This bundled payment approach is intended to promote more efficient care across the acute/post-acute episode because the entity that receives the payment has financial incentives to keep episode costs below the payment. Although the entity is expected to control costs through improved care coordination and efficiency, it could stint on care or avoid expensive patients instead. This issue brief focuses on the unique challenges posed by the inclusion of post-acute care services in a payment bundle and special considerations in implementing and evaluating the episode payment approach."

This article will examine how fragmented health care in the United States contributes to asthma care disparities in minority populations and will discuss how health care reform may help overcome these disparities. Causes of asthma care disparities are marked by the socioeconomic relationship of the disease including, but not limited to, underprescribing and underuse of preventative medication, low primary care follow-up after acute exacerbations, and the limited availability of pharmacy resources in urban communities. Furthermore, the importance of health care coverage cannot be overemphasized. With the recent passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, health care reform offers significant opportunities to reduce or eliminate disparities in minorities. For health care reform to succeed, it must address the specific needs of minorities and support the development of a wide range of community-based interventions and programs with an emphasis on prevention, primary care, chronic care management, and care coordination. In addition, policies that promote cultural competence and improve access and continuity of care are needed, as they serve as predictors of higher-quality asthma care in minorities. Current asthma initiatives targeting minorities need better coordination and increased funding. Solutions to improve adherence to evidence-based clinical practice guidelines may be a potentially powerful tool for reducing or eliminating disparities in asthma care. For asthma care interventions and policies to be effective in targeting asthma care disparities, they must be implemented in a variety of health care settings. © 2011 The Author(s)."

At more than 3 million in number, nurses make up the single largest segment of the health care work force. They also spend the greatest amount of time in delivering patient care as a profession. Nurses therefore have valuable insights and unique abilities to contribute as partners with other health care professionals in improving the quality and safety of care as envisioned in the Affordable Care Act (ACA) enacted this year. Nurses should be fully engaged with other health professionals and assume leadership roles in redesigning care in the United States. To ensure its members are well-prepared, the profession should institute residency training for nurses, increase the percentage of nurses who attain a bachelor's degree to 80 percent by 2020, and double the number who pursue doctorates. Furthermore, regulatory and institutional obstacles -- including limits on nurses' scope of practice -- should be removed so that the health system can reap the full benefit of nurses' training, skills, and knowledge in patient care.

For people living in the 35 states that offer high-risk pools, coverage is available but premiums are 125-200% of standard rates. Additionally, high cost-sharing means enrollees often defer needed care because they must pay large amounts out of pocket. Lack of access may lead to poor health outcomes and disability. The Kansas DMIE investigated whether improving insurance coverage for such a group would improve their health status and reduce their risk of transition to full Social Security disability. Half of the 508 participants received enhanced benefits and nurse case management, the other half received usual risk pool coverage. Outcomes were measured through telephone surveys, focus groups, and claims analysis. Utilization of services increased and health status stabilized for the intervention group, while health status of the control group significantly declined. These findings have broad implications because some plans to be offered under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-148) have similarly high out-of-pocket costs. Considering the long-term cost of full disability, providing adequate health insurance benefits for individuals at high risk of disability may be cost effective. © 2011 - IOS Press and the authors.

Since primary care physicians typically serve as the point of entry into the health care delivery system, an adequate supply of them is critical to meeting the anticipated increase in demand for medical care resulting from the expansion of coverage. This article provides state-level estimates of the anticipated increases in primary care utilization given the PPACA's provisions for expanded coverage. Methods: Using the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, this article estimates a multivariate regression model of annual primary care utilization. Using the model estimates and state-level information regarding the number of uninsured, it predicts, by state, the change in primary care visits expected from the expanded coverage. Finally, the article predicts the number of primary care physicians needed to accommodate this change in utilization. Findings: This expanded coverage is predicted to increase by 2019 the number of annual primary care visits between 15.07 million and 24.26 million. Assuming stable levels of physicians' productivity, between 4,307 and 6,940 additional primary care physicians would be needed to accommodate this increase. Conclusions: The PPACA's health insurance expansion parameters are expected to significantly increase the use of primary care. Two strategies that policymakers may consider are creating stronger financial incentives to attract medical school students to primary care and changing the delivery of care in ways that lead to operational improvements, higher throughput, and better quality of care. © 2011 Milbank Memorial Fund.

The 2010 Congressional election results and recent court rulings challenging the constitutionality of various provisions of the Act suggest that implementation will be anything but straightforward. The proposed changes in health insurance, along with modifications in current reimbursement models, will alter the health-care environment. It is important for pharmacists to be aware of these opportunities and the resultant changes in public expectations. It is with these considerations in mind that The Annals announces the creation of a Health Care Policy expert panel to initiate commentary and discussion regarding health-care policy issues of relevance to the pharmacy community."

Purpose: The authors offer an assessment of the myriad new options created by health reform, with particular emphasis on those that improve and expand services for persons with severe psychiatric disabilities in their homes and communities. Selective information is presented on the expansion of specific state options within Medicaid that, if implemented, may prove most useful for those with serious psychiatric disabilities. Sources Used: Material was drawn from relevant federal statutes and published literature, as well as personal observation. Conclusions and Implications for Practice: While the health care reform law creates many new opportunities for states to fund and provide services for persons with disabilities, the complexity of the law may present implementation challenges for state authorities, providers, advocates, and consumers alike. Those interested in learning more about the options presented in this paper and further implications of health care reform are encouraged to explore additional resources and information.

Yet, small practice settings are often unable to provide the same range of services or partici-pate in quality improvement initiatives as large practices because they lack the staff, infor-mation technology, and office systems. One promising strategy is to share clinical sup-port services and information systems with other practices. New findings from the 2009 Commonwealth Fund International Health Policy Survey of Primary Care Physicians suggest smaller practices that share resources are more likely than those without shared resources to have advanced electronic medical records and health information technology, routinely track and manage patient information, have after-hours care arrangements, and engage in quality monitoring and benchmarking. This issue brief highlights strategies that can increase resources among small- and medium-sized practices and efforts supported by states, the private sector, and the Affordable Care Act that encourage the expansion of shared-resource models."

Study Design: Using data from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, we provided state-level estimates of the size and structure of the US individual market from 2002 to 2009. We estimated the number of insurers expected to have MLRs below the legislated minimum and their corresponding enrollment. In the case of noncompliant insurers exiting the market, we estimated the number of enrollees that may be vulnerable to major coverage disruption given poor health status. Results: In 2009, using a PPACA-adjusted MLR definition, we estimated that 29% of insurer-state observations in the individual market would have MLRs below the 80% minimum, corresponding to 32% of total enrollment. Nine states would have at least one-half of their health insurers below the threshold. If insurers below the MLR threshold exit the market, major coverage disruption could occur for those in poor health; we estimated the range to be between 104,624 and 158,736 member-years. Conclusion: The introduction of MLR regulation as part of the PPACA has the potential to significantly affect the functioning of the individual market for health insurance. © Managed Care & Healthcare Communications, LLC."

Finding ways to curtail costs is urgently needed. Attention to glycemic control and metabolic care offers a cost-effective method of treatment to reduce complications. Recent Findings: Healthcare-related expenses occupy an expanding portion of gross domestic product in the US and are a driver of the deficit. Despite all of this spending, the US receives average marks on outcomes and is not obtaining value in its healthcare. Any movements toward healthcare reform must focus on improving outcomes per healthcare dollar spent, and increasing value. The Affordable Care Act will place greater emphasis on preventing complications and reducing hospital-acquired infections. The original Leuven trial demonstrated that proper implementation of glycemic control can reduce morbidity and mortality. More recent studies have shown that there is a cost-benefit to glycemic control as well, through reduction of hospital stay and prevention of complications. On the basis of these changes, physicians who practice metabolic care and provide glycemic control are well positioned to add value in this era of healthcare reform. Summary: Glycemic control is inherently valuable in the care of ICU patients as it decreases infectious complications, reduces lengths of stay, and has a positive effect on morbidity and mortality. Further studies should be completed to delineate the exact amount of cost-savings that can be obtained by proper implementation of glycemic control in the ICU. © 2011 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins."

Given the unwillingness of many primary care physicians (PCPs) to treat new Medicaid patients, policy makers and others are concerned about adequate primary care capacity to meet the increased demand. States with the smallest number of PCPs per capita overall--gen-erally in the South and Mountain West--potentially will see the largest per-centage increases in Medicaid enrollment, according to a new national study by the Center for Studying Health System Change (HSC). In contrast, states with the largest number of PCPs per capita--primarily in the Northeast--will see more modest increases in Medicaid enrollment. Moreover, geograph-ic differences in PCP acceptance of new Medicaid patients reflect differences in overall PCP supply, not geographic differences in PCPs' willingness to treat Medicaid patients. The law also increases Medicaid reimbursement rates for certain services provided by primary care physicians to 100 percent of Medicare rates in 2013 and 2014. However, the reimbursement increases are likely to have the greatest impact in states that already have a large number of PCPs accepting Medicaid patients. In fact, the percent increase of PCPs accepting Medicaid patients in these states is likely to exceed the percent increase of new Medicaid enrollees. The reimbursement increases will have much less impact in states with a relatively small number of PCPs accepting Medicaid patients now because many of these states already reimburse primary care at rates close to or exceeding 100 percent of Medicare. As a result, growth in Medicaid enrollment in these states will greatly outpace growth in the num-ber of primary care physicians willing to treat new Medicaid patients."

Clinical trials and other biomedical research provide a foundation for this process, and practice guidelines, drawing from their results, inform the optimal management of an increasing number of childhood health problems. However, many clinicians fail to adhere to guidelines. Clinical decision support delivered using health information technology, often in the form of electronic health records, provides a tool to deliver evidence-based information to the point of care and has the potential to overcome barriers to evidence-based practice. An increasing literature now informs how these systems should be designed and implemented to most effectively improve outcomes in pediatrics. Through the examples of computerized physician order entry, as well as the impact of alerts at the point of care on immunization rates, the delivery of evidence-based asthma care, and the follow-up of children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, the following review addresses strategies for success in using these tools. The following review argues that, as decision support evolves, the clinician should no longer be the sole target of information and alerts. Through the Internet and other technologies, families are increasingly seeking health information and gathering input to guide health decisions. By enlisting clinical decision support systems to deliver evidence-based information to both clinicians and families, help families express their preferences and goals, and connect families to the medical home, clinical decision support may ultimately be most effective in improving outcomes. © 2011 Mosby, Inc."

While defined in scope of clinical research, CER has the potential to be applied to other outcomes including economic evaluation of treatments and their potential impact on overall healthcare utilization by using all available data from clinical trials, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and observational studies. Whereas clinical trials have mainly compared new agents with placebo (either alone or added to background therapy), CER compares new treatments head-to-head with active comparators to determine a patient's best available options. Because of the emphasis on the patient, and its potential to identify the best treatment options and produce substantial cost savings, CER is likely to be an integral part of American healthcare reform. The Affordable Care Act's emphasis on CER should benefit patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM), a major chronic disease that affects 26 million Americans. The most recent innovations in marketed T2DM therapies include 2 classes of drugs focused on the incretin system: glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors.

As a large healthcare purchaser, the federal government has made several significant investments in comparative effectiveness research. Notably, in 2009 the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act allocated $1.1 billion for comparative effectiveness research, and in 2010 the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act established a federal institute to organize the federal investment in comparative effectiveness research going forward. Over the past several years, comparative effectiveness research from the public and private sectors has begun to provide a foundation for innovation within the insurance and life sciences industries. Health plans and other payers are experimenting with nuanced coverage and reimbursement policies informed by comparative effectiveness evidence.

The plain meaning of this language might indicate a limited power to regulate commercial trade between persons in one state and persons outside of that state. However, the Commerce Clause has never been construed quite so narrowly. Rather, the clause, along with the economy of the United States, has grown and become more complex. In addition, when Congress began to address national social problems, the Commerce Clause was often cited as the constitutional basis for such legislation. As a result, the Commerce Clause has become the constitutional basis for a significant portion of the laws passed by the Congress over the last fifty years, and it currently represents one of the broadest bases for the exercise of congressional powers. The reliance of the Congress on the Commerce Clause, however, has been controversial, as was the case with the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA, P.L. 111-148). An examination of the United States Code shows that over 700 statutory provisions, covering a range of issues, explicitly refer to either interstate or foreign commerce. Over the last decade, however, the Supreme Court in United States v. Lopez and United States v. Morrison has brought into question the breadth of the Commerce Clause. While these cases have resulted in the overturning of a few federal laws, their overall effect has so far been relatively modest in scope. A recently decided Supreme Court case, Gonzales v. Raich, seems to confirm that the effect of these previous cases will be limited. © 2011 Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved."

Data Sources: Medline, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, PsycINFO, and Social Work Abstract databases were searched for articles that examined prenatal home-visiting and prenatal care utilization or neonatal outcomes, with additional ascendancy and descendancy searches. Listservs were also used to identify unpublished evaluations. Study Selection: Quantitative studies meeting the following criteria were included in the analyses: published between 1985 and 2009, published in English, reported providing prenatal home visiting, and reported on prenatal care utilization or a neonatal outcome. Data Extraction: Study characteristics and findings related to prenatal care utilization, gestational age, and birth weight were abstracted independently by at least two authors. Study quality was assessed across five domains. Data Synthesis: The search yielded 28 studies comparing outcomes for women who did and did not receive prenatal home visiting, with 14 (59%) using an RCT design. Five (17%) studies reporting on prenatal care utilization found a statistically significant improvement in use of prenatal care for women with home visiting. Of 24 studies reporting an effect on birth outcomes, five (21%) found a significant positive effect on gestational age, and seven of 17 (41%) found a significant positive effect on birth weight. Conclusions: More evidence suggests that prenatal home visiting may improve the use of prenatal care, whereas less evidence exists that it improves neonatal birth weight or gestational age.

Additionally, the threat of bioterrorism has caused some to consider the possibility of introducing vaccination programs to prevent an outbreak of serious illnesses. Programs like health care coverage and vaccinations have the potential to violate certain religious beliefs and therefore may conflict with the First Amendment. In the continuing debate over issues for which mandatory health care programs might be solutions, questions have been raised about the constitutional issues relating to exemptions for health care programs. For the purposes of this report, mandatory health care programs are those which require individuals to take some action relating to a health care policy objective. A variety of mandatory health care programs currently exists at the federal and state levels. Some programs are medical programs that require individuals to participate in a medical program, while some programs are financial programs that require individuals to pay for program costs. For example, all 50 states and the District of Columbia require children to be vaccinated for certain illnesses and diseases before entering school. At the federal level, the tax system requires individuals to pay taxes that fund Medicare to provide health care to elderly citizens. In some instances, mandatory health care programs include exemptions that allow qualified persons to opt out of the required action. Specifically, religious exemptions have been provided in a variety of mandatory health care programs, including state immunization laws and Medicare taxes. These religious exemptions permit individuals who object to the program based on religious beliefs to avoid compromising those beliefs. This report will discuss the legal issues that arise in the context of religious exemptions for mandatory health care programs. It will discuss constitutional and statutory provisions relating to religious protection and how such laws have been applied in the medical context. The report will also briefly address examples of health care programs that have included religious exemptions, including a discussion of the religious conscience exemption included in PPACA. It will analyze whether the U.S. Constitution requires religious exemptions for mandatory health care programs and whether, if not required, the Constitution allows religious exemptions for such programs. © 2011 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

States have broad discretion over the use of these funds. In FY2008, the most recent year for which expenditure data are available, the largest expenditures for services under the SSBG were for foster care, child care, and special services for the disabled. Congress has passed a series of continuing resolutions to provide federal funding for FY2011, the most recent of which, P.L. 111-322, is scheduled to expire on March 4, 2011. Each of the continuing resolutions for FY2011 has maintained funding for the SSBG at the FY2010 rate of $1.7 billion. This is the same amount as the Obama Administration requested in the FY2011 President's Budget. The SSBG has received annual appropriations of $1.7 billion since FY2002. Since FY2001, annual appropriations for the SSBG have included a provision stipulating that states may transfer up to 10% of their Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grants to the SSBG. In addition to funding from annual appropriations, the SSBG received supplemental appropriations in FY2006 and FY2009 for necessary expenses resulting from major natural disasters. The SSBG is permanently authorized in Title XX of the Social Security Act (SSA). Congress amended Title XX of the SSA in the health care reform legislation signed into law by President Obama on March 23, 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA; P.L. 111- 148). This law inserted a new subtitle on elder justice into Title XX, which was itself re-titled as Block Grants to States for Social Services and Elder Justice. The health reform law also amended Title XX by establishing two demonstration projects to address the workforce needs of health care professionals and a new competitive grant program to support the early detection of medical conditions related to environmental health hazards.

Individuals who fail to do so are subject to a monetary penalty, administered through the tax code. Although the federal government provides health coverage for many individuals through federal programs such as Medicare, it had never before required individuals to purchase health insurance. This report analyzes certain constitutional issues raised by compelling individuals to purchase health insurance. It addresses the authority of Congress to pass a law of this nature under its taxing power or its power to regulate interstate commerce. With regard to the taxing power, the requirement to purchase health insurance might be construed as a tax and upheld so long as it was found to comply with the constitutional restrictions imposed on direct and indirect taxes. On the other hand, opponents of the minimum essential coverage requirement may argue that since it is imposed conditionally and may be avoided by compliance with regulations set out in the statute, that the requirement may be more accurately described as a penalty. If so, the taxing power alone might not provide Congress the constitutional authority to support this provision. In evaluating under the minimum essential coverage requirement under the Commerce Clause, a court may rely on Supreme Court precedent and look to several factors to determine whether the minimum essential coverage requirement passes constitutional muster. Among other things, a court may evaluate whether the requirement is a regulation of economic activity. One could argue that the requirement to purchase health insurance is economic in nature because it regulates how an individual participates in the health care market, through insurance or otherwise. On the other hand, it may be argued that the minimum essential coverage requirement goes beyond the bounds of the clause, because while regulation of the health insurance industry or the health care system is economic activity, regulating a choice to purchase health insurance is not. It has been questioned whether the requirement to have health insurance might violate certain protections found under the U.S. Constitution. This report discusses how a court might evaluate a challenge to the minimum essential coverage requirement on Fifth Amendment due process, takings clause, or equal protection grounds, as well as under the Tenth Amendment. This report also addresses whether the exceptions to the minimum essential coverage requirement to purchase health insurance satisfy First Amendment freedom of religion protections. Several lawsuits have been filed that challenge the minimum essential coverage requirement on constitutional grounds. For example, in Florida v. HHS, attorneys general and governors in 20 states as well as others brought an action against the Secretaries of Health and Human Services, Treasury, and Labor, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief from certain provisions of PPACA. On October 14, 2010, the district court held that the claims against the minimum essential coverage requirement could proceed to the next stage of litigation. In Virginia ex rel. Cuccinelli v. Sebelius, the Virginia attorney general filed a separate lawsuit challenging the federal requirement to purchase health insurance. On December 13, 2010, the judge in the Virginia case found that the minimum essential coverage requirement is unconstitutional. In contrast, two federal district courts have upheld the minimum essential coverage requirement as a constitutional exercise of the Commerce Clause. Many expect that one or more of these cases will reach the Supreme Court. © 2011 Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved."

Underlying these policy considerations are issues regarding the status of health care as a constitutional or legal right. This report analyzes constitutional and legal issues pertaining to a right to health care, as well as the power of Congress to enact and fund health care programs. Following the recent passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, P.L. 111-148, legal issues have been raised regarding the power of Congress to mandate that individuals purchase health insurance, and the ability of states to "" nullify"" or "" opt out"" of such a requirement. These issues are also discussed. The U.S. Constitution does not set forth an explicit right to health care. While the Supreme Court would likely find that the Constitution provides a right to obtain health care services at one's own expense from willing providers, the Supreme Court has never interpreted the Constitution as guaranteeing a right to health care services from the government for those who cannot afford it. The Supreme Court has, however, held that the government has an obligation to provide medical care in certain limited circumstances, such as for prisoners. While the U.S. Constitution and Supreme Court interpretations do not identify a constitutional right to health care for those who cannot afford it, Congress has enacted numerous statutes, such as Medicare, Medicaid, and the Children's Health Insurance Program, that establish and define specific statutory rights of individuals to receive health care services from the government. As a major component of many health care entitlement statutes, Congress has provided funding to pay for the health services provided under law. Most of these statutes have been enacted pursuant to Congress's authority to "" make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper"" to carry out its mandate "" to ... provide for the ... general Welfare."" The power to spend for the general welfare is one of the broadest grants of authority to Congress in the U.S. Constitution. The Supreme Court accords considerable deference to a legislative decision by Congress that a particular health care spending program provides for the general welfare. Recently, Congress enacted comprehensive health care reform legislation, P.L. 111-148, which includes a requirement, effective in 2014, that individuals purchase health insurance, and which significantly expands the Medicaid program. A number of lawsuits have been filed challenging various provisions of this legislation, including the power of Congress to enact an individual mandate to purchase health insurance under the Commerce Clause or other provisions of the U.S. Constitution. These lawsuits are in various stages of litigation, and it is expected that one or more of these cases will eventually reach the Supreme Court. In addition, several states have passed laws, or amended their state constitutions, to attempt to "" nullify"" or "" opt out"" of the federal individual health insurance mandate. Direct conflicts between federal and state laws, and state constitutional amendments, would raise constitutional issues which are likely to be resolved in favor of federal law under the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution. A number of state constitutions contain provisions relating to health and the provision of health care services. State constitutions may provide constitutional rights that are more expansive than those found under the federal Constitution since federal rights set the minimum standards for the states. © 2011 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

This brief reports on findings from a Consumers Union study that examined consumers' initial reactions to the form. Testing revealed that consumers were able to use the forms to make hypothetical choices among health plans. However, the study also found deep-seated confusion and lack of confidence with respect to health plan cost-sharing. These findings have significant implications for any venue providing comparative displays of health insurance information, like the future state exchanges, and for policies that rely on the ability of consumers to make informed health insurance purchasing decisions, such as ""consumer-driven health care"" policies."

At the same time, however, the legislation requires the states to play key roles in every aspect of the reform agenda (such as expanding Medicaid programs, creating insurance exchanges, and working with providers on delivery system reforms). The complicated intergovernmental partnerships that govern the nation's fragmented and decentralized system are likely to continue, albeit with greater federal oversight and control. But what about intergovernmental relations in the United Kingdom? What impact did the formal devolution of power in 1999 to Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland have on health policy in those nations, and in the United Kingdom more generally? Has devolution begun a political process in which health policy in the United Kingdom will, over time, become increasingly decentralized and fragmented, or will this ""state of unions"" retain its long- standing reputation as perhaps the most centralized of the European nations? In this article, we explore the federalist and intergovernmental implications of recent reforms in the United States and the United Kingdom, and we put forward the argument that political fragmentation (long-standing in the United States and just emerging in the United Kingdom) produces new intergovernmental partnerships that, in turn, produce incremental growth in overall government involvement in the health care arena.

Federal law provided virtually no protection to working mothers until the 2010 enactment of the ""reasonable break time"" provision of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. This provision nonetheless leaves many working mothers uncovered, requires break time only to pump for (not feed) children younger than 1 year, and exempts small employers that demonstrate hardship.

Some state policies and proposals are modeled directly on programs in New Jersey, the first state to require universal screening for postpartum depression among mothers who recently delivered babies. We examined the impact of these policies on a particularly vulnerable population, Medicaid recipients, and found that neither the required screening nor the educational campaign that preceded it was associated with improved treatment initiation, follow-up, or continued care. We argue that New Jersey's policies, although well intentioned, were predicated on an inadequate base of evidence and that efforts should now be undertaken to build that base. We also argue that to improve detection and treatment, policy makers contemplating or implementing postpartum depression mandates should consider additional measures. These could include requiring mechanisms to monitor and enforce the screening requirement; paying providers to execute screening and follow-up; and preliminary testing of interventions before policy changes are enacted. © 2011 by Project HOPE - The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc."

But by definition, eligibility for these programs is sensitive to income and can change over time with fluctuating income and changes in family composition. The law specifies no minimum enrollment period, and subsidy levels will also change as income rises and falls. Using national survey data, we estimate that within six months, more than 35 percent of all adults with family incomes below 200 percent of the federal poverty level will experience a shift in eligibility from Medicaid to an insurance exchange, or the reverse; within a year, 50 percent, or 28 million, will. To minimize the effect on continuity and quality of care, states and the federal government should adopt strategies to reduce the frequency of coverage transitions and to mitigate the disruptions caused by those transitions. Options include establishing a minimum guaranteed eligibility period and ""dually certifying"" some plans to serve both Medicaid and exchange enrollees. © 2011 by Project HOPE - The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc."

Recent health care legislation contains several delivery system reforms that will attempt to address these issues. We review these programs and discuss the implications for practicing urologists. Methods: We evaluated the medical, legal, and public policy literature (both print and electronic) related to contemporary health care reform efforts. We summarized the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (PPACA) and examined four cost-containment and/or quality-improvement mechanisms related to Medicare payment policy that will be implemented by this recently passed law. Results: The PPACA will expand health care coverage and promote bundled payment systems, accountable care organizations, and the patient-centered medical home as the vehicles for containing cost and improving health care quality. The legislation will also establish an independent commission to enact cost-containment policy, which may have significant implications in terms of physician reimbursement. Conclusions: Although the recent health care legislation broadens coverage for millions of Americans, there are limited data demonstrating the effectiveness of the cost-containment and quality-improvement mechanisms established by this law. Results from recently initiated pilot programs will emerge over the coming years, and it remains to be seen how health care costs and quality will be affected. © 2010 Springer-Verlag."

A resurgent Republican Party will mount a sustained challenge at the federal and state levels, but the new Congress will not bring about the Affordable Care Act's repeal. More likely, the law's effectiveness could be undermined by congressional restrictions on its implementation, underfunding of programs to improve public health and train more primary care physicians, and resistance by many states to its mandates. Congress could instead seek a bipartisan accord on improving the law, such as by giving the states more options, but this is unlikely in the current polarized environment. This debate is occurring even as the United States faces an unprecedented crisis in access to health insurance coverage, affecting nearly every demographic group, yet the uninsured have largely become an afterthought. Medical professionalism requires a commitment to improving access to care, and physicians could play a crucial role in informing lawmakers that providing all Americans with affordable health care coverage is a moral and medical imperative to prevent needless suffering and death, and must not be allowed to slip away. © 2011 American College of Physicians."

It represents the most significant transformation of the American health care system since Medicare and Medicaid. It is argued that it will fundamentally change nearly every aspect of health care, from insurance to the final delivery of care. The length and complexity of the legislation and divisive and heated debates have led to massive confusion about the impact of ACA. It also became one of the centerpieces of 2010 congressional campaigns. Essentials of ACA include: 1) a mandate for individuals and businesses requiring as a matter of law that nearly every American have an approved level of health insurance or pay a penalty; 2) a system of federal subsidies to completely or partially pay for the now required health insurance for about 34 million Americans who are currently uninsured - subsidized through Medicaid and exchanges; 3) extensive new requirements on the health insurance industry; and 4) numerous regulations on the practice of medicine. The act is divided into 10 titles. It contains provisions that went into effect starting on June 21, 2010, with the majority of provisions going into effect in 2014 and later. The perceived major impact on practicing physicians in the ACA is related to growing regulatory authority with the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB) and the Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI). In addition to these specifics is a growth of the regulatory regime in association with further discounts in physician reimbursement. With regards to cost controls and projections, many believe that the ACA does not fix the finances of our health care system - neither public nor private. It has been suggested that the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and the administration have used creative accounting to arrive at an alleged deficit reduction; however, if everything is included appropriately and accounted for, we will be facing a significant increase in deficits rather than a reduction. When posed as a global question, polls suggest that public opinion continues to be against the health insurance reform. The newly elected Republican congress is poised to pass a bill aimed at repealing health care reform. However, advocates of the repeal of health care reform have been criticized for not providing a meaningful alternative approach. Those criticisms make clear that it is not sufficient to provide vague arguments against the ACA without addressing core issues embedded in health care reform. It is the opinion of the authors that while some parts of the ACA may be reformed, it is unlikely to be repealed. Indeed, the ACA already is growing roots. Consequently, it will be extremely difficult to repeal. In this manuscript, we look at reducing the regulatory burden on the public and providers and elimination of IPAB and PCORI. The major solution lies in controlling the drug and durable medical supply costs with appropriate negotiating capacity for Medicare, and consequently for other insurers."

The health reform law includes numerous provisions for improving primary care: temporary increases in Medicare and Medicaid payments to primary care providers; support for innovation in the delivery of care, with an emphasis on achieving better health outcomes and patient care experiences; enhanced support of primary care providers; and investment in the continued development of the primary care workforce."

As the paper by Peter Long and Jonathan Gruber in this issue of Health Affairs notes, the ultimate effects of health reform in California will be influenced by the policy and program decisions that state lawmakers and administrators make during the next three years. Key issues include revamping cumbersome eligibility determination and enrollment processes that could prevent rapid enrollment in expanded public health insurance-but also affording that expansion in the face of large state budget deficits.

For hospitals, a traditional response to this increased demand might be to add resources, such as more staff and beds. We argue that such actions would be unaffordable and unnecessary. Research has demonstrated that large gains in efficiency can be made through streamlining patient flow and redesigning care processes. We argue that once managed efficiently, US hospitals, on average, could achieve at least an 80-90 percent bed occupancy rate-at least 15 percent higher than the current level-without adding beds at capital costs of approximately $1 million per bed. This article outlines a plan for hospitals to accommodate more patients without increasing beds or staff, and for policy makers to require hospitals to make these changes or provide incentives for them to do so. ©2011 Project HOPE - The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc."

Pending forthcoming federal regulations, though, it is unclear precisely how these ACOs will be structured. Although large integrated care systems that directly employ physicians may be most likely to evolve into ACOs, few such integrated systems exist in the United States. This paper demonstrates how Advocate Physician Partners in Illinois could serve as a model for a new kind of accountable care organization, by demonstrating how to organize physicians into partnerships with hospitals to improve care, cut costs, and be held accountable for the results. The partnership has signed its first commercial ACO contract effective January 1, 2011, with the largest insurer in Illinois, Blue Cross Blue Shield. Other commercial contracts are expected to follow. In a health care system still dominated by small, independent physician practices, this may constitute a more viable way to push the broader health care system toward accountable care. ©2010 Project HOPE - The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc."

Accountable care organizations have the potential to lower costs, improve the quality of care, facilitate delivery system reform, and promote innovation in health care. The federal government is set to create rules to regulate these organizations and has broad discretion to allow them to pursue a variety of approaches. Drawing on experience from some ACO pilot programs and the Medicare Part D prescription drug coverage program, we argue that regulations governing accountable care organizations should be flexible, encouraging of diversity and innovation and allowing for changes over time based on lessons learned.

Among the most ambitious of the reform models is the accountable care organization (ACO), which will offer providers economic rewards if they can reduce Medicare's cost growth in their communities. However, the dismal history of provider-led attempts to manage costs suggests that this program is unlikely to accomplish its objectives. What's more, if ACOs foster more market concentration among providers, they have the potential to shift costs onto private insurers. This paper proposes a more flexible payment model for providers and private insurers that would divide health care services into three categories: long-term, low-intensity primary care; unscheduled care, including unscheduled emergency services; and major clinical interventions that usually involve hospitalization or organized outpatient care. Each category of care would be paid for differently, with each containing different elements of financial risk for the providers. Health plans would then be encouraged to provide logistical and analytic support to providers in managing health costs in these categories. ©2011 Project HOPE - The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc."

The recently passed affordable health care law, termed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (the ACA, for short) affects physicians more than any other law. Physician services are an integral part of health care. Physicians are paid in the United States for their personal services. This payment also includes the overhead expenses for maintaining an office and providing services. The payment system is highly variable in the private insurance market; however, governmental systems have a formula-based payment, mostly based on the Medicare payment system. Physician services are billed under Part B. Since the inception of the Medicare program in 1965, several methods have been used to determine the amounts paid to physicians for each covered service. Initially, the payment systems compensated physicians on the basis of their charges. In 1975, just over 10 years after the inception of the Medicare program, payments changed so as not to exceed the increase in the Medical Economic Index (MEI). Nevertheless, the policy failed to curb increases in costs, leading to the determination of a yearly change in fees by legislation from 1984 to 1991. In 1992, the fee schedule essentially replaced the prior payment system that was based on the physician's charges, which also failed to live up to expectations for operational success. Then, in 1998, the sustainable growth rate (SGR) system was introduced. In 2009, multiple attempts were made by Congress to repeal the formula - rather unsuccessfully. Consequently, the SGR formula continues to hamper physician payments. The mechanism of the SGR includes 3 components that are incorporated into a statutory formula: expenditure targets, growth rate period, and annual adjustments of payment rates for physician services. Further, the relative value of a physician fee schedule is based on 3 components: physician work, practice expense (PE), and malpractice expense that are used to determine a value ranking for each service to which it is applied. On average, the work component represents 53.5% of a service's relative value, the fee component represents 43.6%, and the malpractice component represents 3.9%. The final schedule for physician payment was issued on November 24, 2010. This was based on a total cut of 30.8% with 24.9% of the cut attributed to SGR. However, as usual, with patchwork efficiency, Congress passed a one-year extension of the 0% update, effective through December 2011. Consequently, CMS issued an emergency update of the 2011 Medicare fee schedule, with multiple revisions, resulting in a reduction of the conversion factor of $36.8729 from December 2010 to $33.9764 for 2011."

Despite the slower growth, the share of the gross domestic product devoted to health spending increased to 17.6 percent in 2009 from 16.6 percent in 2008. The growth rate of health spending continued to outpace the growth of the overall economy, which experienced its largest drop since 1938. The recession contributed to slower growth in private health insurance spending and out-of-pocket spending by consumers, as well as a reduction in capital investments by health care providers. The recession also placed increased burdens on households, businesses, and governments, which meant that fewer financial resources were available to pay for health care. Declining federal revenues and strong growth in federal health spending increased the health spending share of total federal revenue from 37.6 percent in 2008 to 54.2 percent in 2009. ©2011 Project HOPE - The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc."

This expansive vision of a right to health, which included both medical care and the preconditions to health, was subsequently incorporated into the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and has since been enshrined in many international and regional human rights treaties. Roosevelt's vision was never fulfilled because the United States turned its back on economic and social rights.

State-level studies suggest that most existing programs have already reached their approved capacity, and nonteaching hospitals are unlikely to create new programs because of the financial impact and their lack of faculty and staff who would meet accreditation standards as program directors and institutional officials. A perfect storm is therefore brewing: The effects of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, the obesity epidemic, the rise in chronic disease, and the aging and continuing growth of the population will combine to create a much greater demand for medical services at the same time as the relative size of the physician workforce will begin to decline.

These adjustments were originally established based on the statistical relationships between IME and DSH and hospital costs. Due to a variety of policy considerations, the legislated levels of these adjustments may have deviated over time from these 'empirically justified levels,' or simply, 'empirical levels.' In this paper, we estimate the empirical levels of IME and DSH using 2006 hospital data and 2009 Medicare final payment rules. Our analyses suggest that the empirical level for IME would be much smaller than under current law-about one-third to one-half. Our analyses also support the DSH adjustment prescribed by the Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA)-about one-quarter of the pre-ACA level. For IME, the estimates imply an increase in costs of 1.88% for each 10% increase in teaching intensity. For DSH, the estimates imply that costs would rise by 0.52% for each 10% increase in the low-income patient share for large urban hospitals."

Each U.S. state controls the size and scope of the medicine benefit beyond the federally mandated minimum; however, regulations that require balanced budgets and prohibit deficit spending limit each state's control. In a recessionary environment with reduced revenue, state Medicaid programs operate under a fixed or shrinking budget. Thus, the state Medicaid experience of providing high-quality care under explicit financial limits can inform Medicare and private payers of measures that control per-capita costs without adversely affecting health outcomes. The academic medicine community must play an expanded role in filling evidence gaps in order to continuously improve health policy making among U.S. states. The Drug Effectiveness Review Project and the Medicaid Evidence-based Decisions Project are two multistate Medicaid collaborations that leverage academic health center researchers' comparative effectiveness research (CER) projects to answer policy-relevant research questions. The authors of this article highlight how academic medicine can support states' health policies through CER and how CER-driven benefit-design choices can help states meet their cost and quality needs. © 2011 Association of American Medical Colleges."

The causes of this maldistribution include financial barriers that prevent the individuals who would be the most likely to serve in primary care and underserved areas from entering the profession, large taxpayer subsidies to teaching hospitals that provide incentives to act in ways that are not in the best interest of society, and reimbursement policies that discourage physicians from providing primary care. The authors propose that the maldistribution of physicians can be addressed successfully by reducing the financial barriers to becoming a primary care physician, aligning subsidies with societal interests, and providing financial incentives that target primary care. They suggest that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 takes steps in the right direction but that more financially prudent measures should be taken as politicians revisit health care reform with heightened financial scrutiny.

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (PPACA) became law in March 2010. Despite efforts by the new Republican majority in the House of Representatives of the 112th Congress to repeal the bill, some aspects of PPACA have already taken effect, and the majority of the remainder are scheduled to be implemented by 2014. PPACA will change the U.S. health care system in fundamental ways. Perhaps more than other entities in the U.S. health care system, academic health centers (AHCs) will bear the impact of the struggle to care for 32 million new, primarily low-income insurance beneficiaries. A large influx of new patients trying to access the health care system through AHCs will coincide with major changes in the financing of health care, the training of health professions students, and the conduct of biomedical research. Although many of the sweeping changes coming through PPACA will not happen until later in this decade, AHCs must begin planning for the future now if they are to prosper, or even survive, in the brave new world of health care reform. The author of this commentary first briefly analyzes some of the most important effects PPACA will have on AHCs and then makes recommendations for how AHCs can prepare to take advantage of the opportunities and mitigate the challenges inherent in implementing PPACA.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper's approach is to tap into well-known wellness program providers, like Virgin HealthMiles, CIGNA and CVS Caremark, to provide insight into how marketers are looking to utilize the ""carrot"" (positive incentives) to inspire consumers to stay healthy rather than the stick (punishment). Findings: The new health care legislation signed by President Obama in March, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, has put a firm stamp of approval and support behind the use of incentives and rewards by health and wellness programs. In effect, loyalty marketing tactics are becoming a more important tool than ever in health care reform. Most noticeably, beginning in 2014, employers will be able to offer their workers an increased amount of rewards, worth up to 30-50 percent of their health coverage costs, for participating in a wellness program and meeting health benchmarks. In addition, health insurance companies will be required to implement health and wellness promotion activities. Practical implications: Deploying loyalty tactics by the ""carrot"" contingent has put into practice the growing disciplines of ""behavioral economics"" and ""choice architecture"" that have become hot topics over the past couple of years within various industries, including government and finance. Best-selling books such as Freakonomics and Predictably Irrational have focused on behavioral economics, defined as the use of social, cognitive and emotional factors in understanding and influencing the decisions of individuals. Digital tools are being used to create a handy consumer-direct link and motivational boost to the consumer-pharmacy relationship. WellQ - a wellness behavior-change program developed by LoyaltyOne in partnership with the American Pharmacists Association - seeks to help patients shift their own behavior around their medications and health care, with the help of their retail pharmacy, where consumers sign up and provide a profile of medications and current health habits. Through WellQ, they then begin to receive mobile text-based reminders as well as bite-size educational and motivational content around self-care delivered to their cell phones.

On the same day, CBO issued an analysis of the long-term budgetary impact of Chairman Ryan's budget proposal based on specifications provided by House Budget Committee staff. The House Budget Committee considered and amended the Chairman's mark on April 6, 2011, and voted to report the budget resolution to the full House. H.Con.Res. 34 was introduced in the House April 11, 2011, and was accompanied by the committee report (H.Rept. 112-158). A budget resolution provides general budgetary parameters; however, it is not a law. Changes to programs that are assumed or suggested by the budget resolution would still need to be passed by separate legislation. Chairman Ryan's budget proposal, as outlined in his report, the committee report, and in the CBO analysis, suggests short-term and long-term changes to federal health care programs including Medicare, Medicaid, and the health insurance exchanges established by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA, P.L. 111-148). Within the 10-year budget window (FY2012-FY2021), the budget proposal assumes that certain PPACA provisions would be repealed, including those that provide additional coverage under the Medicare prescription drug benefit, that expand Medicaid coverage to the non-elderly with incomes below 133% of the federal poverty level, and those provisions that establish health insurance exchanges. The proposal would also restructure Medicaid from an individual entitlement program to a block grant program beginning in FY20 13. Beyond the 10-year budget window, beginning in 2022, the budget proposal assumes an increase in the age of eligibility for Medicare, the conversion of Medicare to a fixed federal contribution program, and a restructuring of coverage for the elderly under Medicaid. This report summarizes the proposed changes to Medicare, Medicaid, and private health insurance as described in the House budget resolution, Chairman Ryan's ?Path to Prosperity? report, the House Budget Committee report, and the CBO analysis.

These include supportive services, congregate nutrition services (meals served at group sites such as senior centers, community centers, schools, churches, or senior housing complexes), home-delivered nutrition services, family caregiver support, community service employment, the long-term care ombudsman program, and services to prevent the abuse, neglect and exploitation of older persons. The OAA also supports grants to older Native Americans and research, training, and demonstration activities. Funding for most OAA programs is provided through appropriations legislation for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies (Labor-HHS-Education). The FY2010 Consolidated Appropriations Act (P.L. 111-117), signed into law December 16, 2009, provides $2.328 billion for OAA programs in FY2010. The FY2009 Omnibus Appropriations Act (P.L. 111-8) provided $2.052 billion for OAA programs for FY2009. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA, P.L. 111- 5) provided $220.0 million in additional FY2009 funding ($100.0 million for nutrition programs and $120.0 million for the Title V, Community Service Employment for Older Americans Program, or CSEOA). Total FY2009 OAA funding was $2.272 billion. The FY2010 funding level for OAA programs is a 13% increase over the funding provided by the FY2009 Omnibus Appropriations Act, and a 2% increase over total FY2009 funding (including both the Omnibus and ARRA). CSEOA received the bulk of this increased funding. Congress appropriated $825.4 million to CSEOA in FY2010, compared with $691.9 million in FY2009 funding ($571.9 million from the FY2009 Omnibus, and $120.0 million from ARRA). The President's FY2011 Budget proposes $2.209 billion for OAA programs, 5% less than the FY2010 level. CSEOA would receive $600.425 million, 27% less than its FY2010 level. The FY2011 Budget proposes a $102.5 million Caregiver Initiative that would increase funding for services to help family caregivers. The Caregiver Initiative proposes a $48.0 million increase for supportive services and a $48.0 million increase for family caregiver support services, both under OAA's Title III. The Caregiver Initiative also proposes a $2.0 million increase for Native American supportive services and a $2.0 million increase for Native American caregiver support services, both under Title VI. Finally, the Caregiver Initiative proposes a $2.5 million increase for Lifespan Respite Care. On March 23, 2010, President Obama signed into law a comprehensive health care reform bill, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA; P.L. 111-148). Among other things, the act appropriates $10 million in mandatory spending for Aging and Disability Resource Centers (ADRCs) through FY2014. It also authorizes additional funding to the aging network, including $15.0 million to ADRCs and $10.0 million to Area Agencies on Aging (AAAs) for outreach and education programs related to Medicare low-income assistance programs. These funds are available for obligation through FY2012. This report provides details of FY2010 funding and the FY2011 budget request for OAA as well as for programs such as the Alzheimer's Disease Supportive Services Program (ADSSP) and Lifespan Respite Care Program which are administered by the Administration on Aging (AOA), but authorized under the Public Health Service Act (PHSA). © 2013 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Part A of the program, the Hospital Insurance program, covers hospital, post-hospital, and hospice services. Part B, the Supplementary Medical Insurance program, covers a broad range of complementary medical services including physician, laboratory, outpatient hospital services, and durable medical equipment. Part C provides private plan options for beneficiaries enrolled in both Parts A and B. Part D is an optional outpatient prescription drug program. Medicare has established specific rules for payment of covered benefits. Some, such as physician services and most durable medical equipment, are based on fee schedules. Some payments are based, in part, on a provider's bid (an estimate of the cost of providing a service) relative to a benchmark (the maximum amount Medicare will pay). Bids and benchmarks are used to determine payments in Medicare Parts C and D. Payments for some items of durable medical equipment in specified locations are to be based on competitive bidding, starting in 2011. Many services, however, including inpatient and outpatient hospital care, are paid under different prospective payment systems (PPSs). In general, the program provides for annual updates to these payment amounts. The program also has rules regarding the amount of cost sharing, if any, which beneficiaries can be billed in excess of Medicare's recognized payment levels. Unlike other services, Medicare's outpatient prescription drug benefit can be obtained only through private plans. Further, while all Part D plans must meet certain minimum requirements, they differ in terms of benefit design, formulary drugs, and cost-sharing amounts. Medicare payment policies and potential changes to these policies are of continuing interest to Congress. The Medicare program has been a major focus of deficit reduction legislation since 1980. With certain exceptions, reductions in program spending have been achieved largely through regulating payments to providers, primarily hospitals and physicians. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (P.L. 105-33, BBA) modified some existing payment policies, including changing underlying payment methodologies and updates to payment amounts. Subsequent legislation increased Medicare funding to mitigate the financial impact of some BBA provisions. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (P.L. 108-173, MMA), too, modified payment methods and established payment increases for some providers. Most recently, the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 (P.L. 109-432, TRHCA); the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Extension Act of 2007 (P.L. 110-173, MMSEA); the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 (P.L. 110-275, MIPPA); and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-148), as modified by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-152), have affected Medicare's payments. This report provides an overview of Medicare payment rules by type of service, outlines current payment policies, and summarizes the basic rules for program updates.

The Ryan White program currently serves more than half a million low-income people with HIV/AIDS in the United States; 33% of those served are uninsured, and an additional 56% are underinsured. The program is administered by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Its statutory authority is Title XXVI of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act, originally enacted in 1990. The Ryan White program is composed of four major parts and several other components. Part A provides grants to urban areas and mid-sized cities. Part B provides grants to states and territories; it also provides funds for the AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP). Part C provides early intervention grants to public and private nonprofit entities. Part D provides grants to public and private nonprofit entities for family-centered care for women, infants, children, and youth with HIV/AIDS. The other components, sometimes referred to as Part F, include the AIDS Dental Reimbursement (ADR) Program, the Community-Based Dental Partnership Program, the AIDS Education and Training Centers (AETCs), the Special Projects of National Significance (SPNS) Program, and the Minority AIDS Initiative (MAI). In October 2009, the 111th Congress passed and President Obama signed the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Treatment Extension Act of 2009 (P.L. 111-87), which reauthorizes the Ryan White program through September 30, 2013. P.L. 111-87 maintains the hold-harmless provision for Part A and Part B and provides a continuation of the transition period for states that do not have a fully mature name-based HIV reporting system. The new law requires that the Secretary establish a national HIV/AIDS testing goal of 5 million tests annually through programs administered by HRSA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It requires the Part A Planning Councils to develop a strategy for identifying individuals with HIV/AIDS who do not know their HIV status, making them aware of their status and connecting them with health care and support services. It also requires the Part B grant application to provide a comprehensive plan for the identification of such individuals and enable their access to medical treatment. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA, P.L. 111-148) contains general provisions to increase access to health insurance and which, therefore, will increase coverage for people living with HIV/AIDS. PPACA includes prohibitions on the cancellation of coverage by an insurer due to a preexisting condition, elimination of lifetime caps on insurance benefits and annual limits on coverage, and eligibility for tax subsidies to assist low- and middle-income individuals in the purchase of coverage from state health insurance exchanges. In addition, Medicaid eligibility will be broadened to include single adults, and PPACA phases out the Medicare Part D doughnut hole for HIV/AIDS individuals who are Medicare eligible. Ryan White programs received $2.266 billion for FY2010 in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010 (P.L. 111-117). In July 2010 HHS announced the reallocation of $25 million in funds for ADAP from dozens of programs throughout HHS. The additional funds were targeted for states with ADAP waiting lists or other cost containment strategies. The Obama Administration's request for Ryan White programs in FY2011 is $2.305 billion, an increase of $39.513 million over the FY2010 appropriation. The House Labor-HHS-Education Appropriations Subcommittee held a markup session in July 2010, but the full committee did not report a bill. The Senate Committee on Appropriations reported S. 3686 (S.Rept. 111-243) in August 2010, but the bill did not receive any further action. The Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011 (P.L. 111-242), as amended, provides temporary FY2011 funding through March 4, 2011, at the FY2010 rate of operations. The Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program makes federal funds available to metropolitan areas and states to provide a number of health care services for HIV/AIDS patients including medical care, drug treatments, dental care, home health care, and outpatient mental health and substance abuse treatment. The program currently serves more than half a million low-income people with HIV/AIDS in the United States; 33% of those served are uninsured, and an additional 56% are underinsured.1 The Ryan White program was established in law in 1990 (P.L. 101-381) and reauthorized and amended in 1996 (P.L. 104-146), 2000 (P.L. 106-345), 2006 (P.L. 109-415), and 2009 (P.L. 111- 87). It was enacted as Title XXVI of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act and codified as Parts A, B, C, D, E, and F under 42 U.S.C. § 300ff-11 et seq. The program is administered by the HRSA HIV/AIDS Bureau. Most Ryan White funding is distributed to eligible entities based on formulas that take into account living cases of HIV/AIDS. Funding for the individual grant programs (Parts A, B, C, D, and F), appears in Table 1 at the end of this report. P.L. 109-415 had reauthorized the Ryan White program through September 30, 2009.2 On September 9, 2009, the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health held a hearing to consider draft legislation that would reauthorize the Ryan White program.

Individual and small-group insurance plans and markets will see the biggest changes, but PPACA also affects large employer and self-insured plans by imposing rules for benefit design and health plan practices. Over half of workers--most often those in very large firms--are covered by self-insured health plans in which employers (or employee groups) bear all or some of the risk of providing insurance coverage to a defined population of workers and their dependents. As PPACA provisions become effective, some have argued that smaller firms that offer insurance may opt to self-insure their health benefits because of new small-group market rules. Such a shift could affect risk pooling in the small-group market. This paper examines the definition and prevalence of self-insured health plans, the application of PPACA provisions to these plans, and the possible effects on the broader health insurance market, should many more employers decide to self-insure."

For this reason, oncologists and researchers must be intimately involved in the implementation and interpretation of this important legislation. A major goal of the Act is to improve access to affordable, quality health care. An important element in achieving this goal will be to learn from patients' experiences and build the foundation for evidence-based personalized medicine. This will require a partnership among researchers, clinicians, policy makers and regulators, and patients to design an integrated information network system that will be the basis for providing the right treatment for the right patient in the right place at the right time. In this review, we will discuss the salient points of the Act that specifically affect cancer research and care, as well as highlight opportunities for oncologists and researchers to play a primary role in developing a health care system that includes personalized medicine approaches that will in turn enhance the likelihood of achieving the goals and objectives of the health care reform act. ©2010 AACR."

Several early provisions that go into effect in 2010, including preexisting condition insurance plans, will provide transitional assistance for adults who have struggled to gain health insurance. The biggest improvements will come in 2014 through a significant expansion in eligibility for Medicaid and the creation of health insurance exchanges with subsidized private insurance for people with low and moderate incomes. Of the 8.6 million adults ages 50 to 64 who were uninsured in 2009, up to 6.8 million may gain subsidized insurance through Medicaid and the exchanges and 1.4 million with higher incomes will have access to comprehensive health plans with new consumer protections."

This issue brief examines data for all states on changes in private employer premiums and deductibles for 2003 and 2009. The analysis finds that premiums for businesses and their employees increased 41 percent across states from 2003 to 2009, while per-person deductibles jumped 77 percent in large as well as small firms. If these trends continue at the rate prior to enactment of the Affordable Care Act, the average premium for family coverage will rise 79 percent by 2020, to more than $23,000. The authors describe how health reform offers the potential to reduce insurance cost growth while improving value and protection. If reforms succeed in slowing premium growth by 1 percentage point annually in all states, by 2020 employers and families together will save $2,323 annually for family coverage, compared with projected trends."

In March 2010, the Senate version-the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (referred to as the Affordable Care Act [ACA])-was signed into law. Methods. The authors establish the context for ACA dental provisions by reviewing prior federal legislation pertaining to dental coverage. They analyze the final U.S. House and Senate health care reform bills for their oral health content and draw observations regarding congressional interest in oral health. Results. The authors identify and describe more than 30 provisions of direct relevance to dentistry within the domains of insurance coverage, dental workforce, safety net, prevention and surveillance. Although the two bills differed in many details, both address oral health infrastructure and delivery of care, with particular attention to underserved child and adolescent populations. Conclusions. The oral health provisions in the health care reform bills evidenced strong congressional interest in oral health and dental care, with an emphasis on equitable care for children. : Practice Implications. The effect of each congressional action on the future of dental practice will depend on how the provisions are regulated and implemented. The dental profession needs to recognize the strong and ongoing interest of lawmakers in oral health care and must maintain active engagement in the policymaking process."

After polling over 10,000 Americans via three polls on these topics over four months, a few distinct trends have emerged. When it comes to health care reform, Americans want a ""tune-up,"" not a ""trade-in"" of their health care system by implementing reforms that allow the system to work more efficiently for the largest number of people possible, paying for it through savings found by reducing extraneous and wasteful spending and by increasing the quality of care.

When reviewed, the 13 studies (1) lacked uniform measures among databases; (2) lacked longitudinal studies that followed the respondent over time from the beginning of their career to retirement; (3) had response rates that contributed to small sample sizes or sampling frame that did not take into consideration all characteristics of interest; (4) lacked attention to an interdisciplinary mix of providers; and (5) implied the need for future study on intergenerational characteristics due to shifting demographics in the profession and nursing workforce."

Methods: The author conducted a literature review to present an historical analysis of policies designed to increase the availability and use of primary care in the U.S. Results: Despite widespread agreement that the use of primary care should be expanded, U.S. policies have encouraged the growth of a system that relies predominantly on specialty care. The 2010 health reform law includes several provisions designed to increase the availability and use of primary care, but the new Congress has threatened to delay the law's implementation. Conclusions: As concepts, primary care and prevention enjoy nearly universal support in the U.S., but the reality does not match the rhetoric."

Despite premium subsidies for people with incomes up to 400 percent of the poverty level, or $88,200 for a family of four in 2010, and an individual requirement to enroll in coverage, no one knows who will enroll in the exchanges and who will not, at least initially. Almost 40 percent of uninsured people eligible to receive subsidies through the exchanges have chronic conditions or report fair or poor health, and another 28 percent report recent problems with access to care or paying medical bills, according to a new national study by the Center for Studying Health System Change (HSC). However, about one-third of uninsured people eligible for subsidies have had no recent problems with their health, access to medical care or paying medical bills. Enrolling these apparently healthy uninsured people is likely to be challenging but essential to avoiding adverse selection, or enrolling sicker-than-average people, in the exchanges. Otherwise, health insurance costs in the exchanges could be higher than expected. Contrary to popular perception, many of these healthy and low-cost uninsured people view themselves as risk-averse, which could motivate them to gain coverage in the absence of health or access problems. Also, most uninsured people believe they need health coverage, although fewer believe that health insurance is currently worth the cost, a situation that could change once premium subsidies are available in 2014."

The best way for a company to combat this risk is to understand and plan for reimbursement from the very beginning of product inception. When they get to the point of performing clinical trials, companies must build in cost-effectiveness metrics."

Recent payment reductions by Medicare limited the rewards for imaging self-referral, and the Affordable Care Act mandated disclosure of physicians' ownership interests. However, the rewards for imaging self-referral remain strong.

This article reviews the development of the subsidy, the support by the federal government and the issues that have arisen. It also presents analysis of data from a set of companies that offered retiree health in 2006 and 2007. The data show widespread acceptance of the subsidy and continuance of prescription coverage; however, companies that did not take the subsidy were more likely to be smaller and in less robust financial health. Analysis of a subset of the companies shows the magnitude of the benefits paid yearly and the accounting liability caused by retiree health relative to the size of the subsidy. The author concludes that the potential success or failure of the federal subsidy in preserving retiree health benefits will not be known for years. Nevertheless, with the elimination of the deductibility of the subsidy in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), employers surely will reexamine their offer of prescription coverage to retirees."

The law's requirement for coverage of mental and substance use disorders reflects this position. This Open Forum examines these arguments in light of current state fiscal crises and impending reforms. Despite the federal government's interest in expanding prevention and treatment of mental illness, states may demonstrate varying levels of commitment, based in part on their perception of health care as a right or a commodity. The federal government should outline clear performance standards, with minimum services specified to maximize state commitments to services."

This involves adding a new layer of boards and programs onto the existing system.Existing arrangements will be disrupted. Millions of Americans will find their employer-sponsored insurance is replaced by coverage through new health exchanges or Medicaid. There will be improvements as a result of this for many, but others will find that their access to physicians and therapies becomes more limited.The legislation will encourage or require tighter practice guidelines intended to improve quality and pay-for-performance. A problem is that under the administrative state approach, the strategy will involve more restrictions on physician practice based on centralized interpretations of quality and effectiveness.Spending on health care will grow, and anticipated savings are not likely to be fully realized. This will increase future pressure for cost control. The likely result will be a form of rationing, which includes further tightening of practice guidelines and payments increasingly tied to the federal government's determination of quality and what constitutes essential services. © 2010 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins."

One particularly important implementation issue is the scope of mental health and substance abuse services under expanded health insurance coverage. This article examines current public and commercial insurance coverage of the range of services used by individuals with mental illnesses and substance use disorders and assesses the implications of newly mandated standards for benefit packages offered by public and private plans. The authors note that many services needed by individuals with mental or substance use disorders fall outside the scope of benefits currently covered by a typical private insurance plan. Compared with other insurers, Medicaid currently covers a broader range of behavioral health services; however, individuals moving into Medicaid under new eligibility pathways will receive ""benchmark"" or ""benchmark-equivalent"" coverage rather than full Medicaid benefits. If behavioral health benefits are set at those currently available in typical private plans or in benchmark coverage, some newly insured individuals with mental illnesses or substance use disorders who are covered by private plans or Medicaid expansions are still likely to face gaps in covered services. Policy makers have several options for addressing these likely gaps in coverage, including requiring states to maintain coverage of some support services, including certain behavioral health services in the ""essential benefits package,"" and expanding eligibility for full Medicaid benefits."

We stand by these recommendations, but they need to be updated in light of the new Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA). Reducing healthcare spending growth remains an urgent and unresolved issue, especially as the ACA expands insurance coverage to 32 million more Americans. Some of our reform recommendations were addressed completely or partially in ACA, and others were not. While more should be done legislatively, the current reform legislation includes important opportunities that will require decisive steps in regulation and execution to fulfill their potential for curbing spending growth. Executing these steps will not be automatic or easy. Yet doing so can achieve a healthcare system based on evidence, meaningful choice, balance between regulation and market forces, and collaboration that will benefit patients and the economy (see Appendix A for a description of these key themes). We focus on three concrete objectives to be reached within the next five years to achieve savings while improving quality across the health system: 1. Speed payment reforms away from traditional volume-based payment systems so that most health payments in this country align better with quality and efficiency. 2. Implement health insurance exchanges and other insurance reforms in ways that assure most Americans are rewarded with substantial savings when they choose plans that offer higher quality care at lower premiums. 3. Reform coverage so that most Americans can save money and obtain other meaningful benefits when they make decisions that improve their health and reduce costs. We believe these are feasible objectives with much progress possible even without further legislation (see Appendix B for a listing of recommendations). However, additional legislation is still needed to support consumers - including Medicare beneficiaries - in making choices that reduce costs while improving health."

It guarantees access to health care for all Americans, creates new incentives to change clinical practice to foster better coordination and quality, gives physicians more information to make them better clinicians and patients more information to make them more value-conscious consumers, and changes the payment system to reward value. The Act and the health information technology provisions in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act remove many barriers to delivering high-quality care, such as unnecessary administrative complexity, inaccessible clinical data, and insufficient access to primary care and allied health providers. We hope that physicians will embrace the opportunities created by the Affordable Care Act that will enable them to provide better care for their patients and lead the U.S. health system in a more positive direction. To fully realize the benefits of the Affordable Care Act for their practices and their patients, physicians will design their offices for seamless care, employing new practice models and using technology to integrate patient information with professional society guidelines to keep patients with chronic conditions healthy and out of the hospital. Under the Affordable Care Act, physicians who effectively collaborate with other providers to improve patient outcomes, the value of medical services, and patient experiences will thrive and be the leaders of the health care system."

The Act seeks to expand coverage, limit the growth in health care costs and reform the delivery and insurance systems. In Part I of this two part series, we provide an overview and perspective of changes in private health insurance resulting from HCR. Under the plan, all Americans will be required to purchase coverage through their employer or via an improved individual/small group market. This legislation limits abusive practices such as limitations on preexisting conditions, lifetime and annual coverage limitations and dropping of beneficiaries if they become sick. The legislation will also limit high-cost plans and regulate premium increases. Private sector reforms are likely to benefit our patients by increasing the number of patients with access to transplant services, since the use of 'preexisting' conditions will be eliminated. However without a concomitant increase in the organ supply, longer waiting times and greater use of marginal organs are likely to increase the cost of transplant. Furthermore, transplant providers will receive reduced reimbursement as a result of market consolidation and the growing power of large transplant networks. © 2010 The American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons."

The Affordable Care Act directs the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to establish a minimum level of health benefits, called the essential health benefits, that must be offered by certain health plans, including all plans participating in the individual and small group health insurance markets. This Article argues that this process for defining the essential health benefits will fail to produce coverage standards that are both fair and serve the public interest, as political considerations will lead politicians to mandate coverage of health benefits desired by the public and special ¡ groups, regardless of the merits of doing so. To reduce the influence of shortterm politics in the development of national coverage standards, the Article recommends two fundamental changes to the process. First, Congress should establish an independent commission that would make recommendations to Congress regarding the essential health benefits. Second, Congress should adopt internal rules of congressional procedure that, in the event that lawmakers modify the commission's recommendations, obligate them to offset the costs of mandating coverage of certain conditions or procedures by excluding other benefits from the essential health benefits. Together, these requirements would make it more difficult for lawmakers to modify the shape of the essential health benefits for political gain, as they would intensify conflict among interest groups and place procedural hurdles in the path of mandated benefits legislation. With significant independence from both Congress and the president, a commission would then have the freedom to engage in a thoughtful, deliberative review of the relevant scientific, economic, and moral factors, with primary consideration given to the overall fairness of the coverage standards rather than their political impact."

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) includes provisions to resolve some of these issues. The DRA reduced the maximum amount the federal government would pay state Medicaid programs for generic drugs, and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid services (CMS) final regulation, to implement the DRA provisions was met with a lawsuit from the pharmacy industry. An injunction by the federal district court, followed by a congressional moratorium, kept CMS from implementing the regulation and kept the pre-DRA formula for the generic drug payment limit in place. PPACA provisions increase maximum federal reimbursement levels for Medicaid generic drugs, but the impact on the pharmacy industry depends on CMS implementation and state policies.

The federal government is supporting the expansion of CER through funding made available in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) and by establishing the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute through the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010. At the same time, personalized medicine is generating debate about its place in clinical medicine, and so, naturally, how CER can or cannot play a role in personalized medicine is part of these debates. At the heart of the debate around the role of CER in personalized medicine is the nature of personalized medicine and how it fits within contemporary clinical research concepts. We maintain in this article that CER can serve to catalyze personalized medicine, but we recognize that, for this to happen, researchers will need to embrace new data sources and new analytic approaches. We also recognize that drug technology assessment processes will have to undergo necessary adaptations to accommodate CER as configured for personalized medicine, and that clinicians will need to be educated appropriately and provided access to decision-support systems through health information technology to use the information coming from this research.To illustrate our argument, we describe two ongoing CER studies funded and managed in the private sector evaluating personalized medicine interventions that have important clinical and financial implications. One of the studies investigates the clinical and financial effects of pharmacogenomic testing for warfarin as prescribed in conditions of typical practice settings.

Methods: The 2009 National Health Interview Survey and the 2009 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System were used to estimate national and state adult smoking prevalence, respectively. Cigarette smokers were defined as adults aged ≥18 years who reported having smoked ≥100 cigarettes in their lifetime and now smoke every day or some days. Results: In 2009, 20.6% of U.S. adults aged ≥18 years were current cigarette smokers. Men (23.5%) were more likely than women (17.9%) to be current smokers. The prevalence of smoking was 31.1% among persons below the federal poverty level. For adults aged ≥25 years, the prevalence of smoking was 28.5% among persons with less than a high school diploma, compared with 5.6% among those with a graduate degree. Regional differences were observed, with the West having the lowest prevalence (16.4%) and higher prevalences being observed in the South (21.8%) and Midwest (23.1%). From 2005 to 2009, the proportion of U.S. adults who were current cigarette smokers did not change (20.9% in 2005 and 20.6% in 2009). Conclusions: Previous declines in smoking prevalence in the United States have stalled during the past 5 years; the burden of cigarette smoking continues to be high, especially in persons living below the federal poverty level and with low educational attainment. Sustained, adequately funded, comprehensive tobacco control programs could reduce adult smoking. Implications for Public Health Practice: To further reduce disease and death from cigarette smoking, declines in cigarette smoking among adults must accelerate. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is expected to expand access to evidence-based smoking-cessation services and treatments; this likely will result in additional use of these services and reductions of current smoking and its adverse effects among U.S. adults. Population-based prevention strategies such as tobacco taxes, media campaigns, and smoke-free policies, in concert with clinical cessation interventions, can help adults quit and prevent the uptake of tobacco use, furthering the reduction in the current prevalence of tobacco use in the United States across age groups."

This technical but creative approach would allow insurers to combine what is known as ""list-billing"" with a Section 125 ""cafeteria plan."" However, these state-level reform attempts have failed to gain significant traction because state small-group reform laws and federal restrictions on medical underwriting cloud the legality of tax-sheltered list-billing. Several authorities have taken the position that insurance paid for through a cafeteria plan must meet the nondiscrimination requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act with respect to eligibility, premiums, and benefits.

He states that every small-business owner needs to be aware of the implications and available tax credits arising out of the health care reform plan to make the most informed decisions for their enterprise. It is essential to know that the Affordable Care Act provides tax credits for small business with less than 25 full-time employees and an average annual wage of $50,000 per full-time employee equivalent and the employer pays at least half of the insurance premiums. The tax credit is up to 35 percent in 2010 and goes up to 50 percent starting in 2014.

In this brief, the ACA-authorized primary care payment adjustments are modeled in a prototypical rural primary care practice to assess both the potential impact on physician personal income and the likelihood that the changes will achieve the desired policy outcome. Key Findings. (1) The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) increases physician personal income in a prototypical primary care practice an average of $3,537 (1.9%) in 2010 compared to baseline income as if the ACA were not enacted. In 2011, physician personal income in a prototypical primary care practice increases by an average of $12,013 (9.3%) compared to baseline. (2) Due to Geographic Practice Cost Index (GPCI) changes legislated by the ACA, physician personal income increases are greater in entire-state Medicare payment localities than in states with multiple Medicare payment localities. (3) The requirement that at least 60% of a practice's furnished services must be specific ""primary care services"" to receive the ACA primary care bonus may eliminate eligibility for rural primary care practices that tend to offer more procedures (thus proportionally fewer primary care services) than urban/suburban practices. (4) The ACA primary care payment increases may be too small to have a significant impact on primary care and rural physician shortages. Targeted and significant primary care payment bonuses may be a more effective policy to reduce specific physician shortages."

Currently, the most visible fight is over scope of practice (SOP) expansion, state laws that govern advanced practice nursing and vary idiosyncratically by state. Until there is an expansion of SOP, APNs in many states will not be able to provide services to the fullest extent of their training and knowledge, skills, and experience and patients will continue to go without care. For physicians, the values and identity associated with the history of the medical profession being dominant transcend the policy details and budgetary considerations that might be viewed as ""interests."" For nursing, the values for trust and professional recognition associated with providing high-quality care to all is central to the profession's identity and transcend the interest-based conflict. A mediator can challenge thought leaders from both professions to acknowledge their core values, to facilitate discussions in which each side accepts those aspects of the other's values that it can agree with, and then build on those shared beliefs."

Most major functions of medical technology companies are inextricably linked to reimbursement. It directly affects capital funding, company valuations, and the commercialization of products. These activities support the future use of codes, sales projections, insurance coverage, regulatory filings, product labeling, and other key company business. Device firms that thoughtfully plan their reimbursement strategies are positioned to secure market share and sales they might otherwise have lost. Partisan efforts continued, and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) passed into law on March 23, 2010. These regulations were further amended through passage of the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 that was signed into law by the president on March 30, 2010. Foreseeable trends in US healthcare finance include the continuing consolidation of the insurance community, making it more difficult for providers to negotiate favorable payment rates."

Final passage was the culmination of over a month of behind-the-scenes negotiations and strategy sessions coordinated by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV). In this paper, I trace and evaluate Harry Reid's coalition-building efforts on health care reform in the months leading up to the Christmas Eve vote using concepts drawn from the political science literature on legislative leadership. I conclude that Reid adopted precisely the transactional, ""keep-the-chains- moving"" leadership posture that matched both the institution he leads and his limited personal investment in the issue of health care prior to 2009. Efforts to paint Reid's performance on this issue as a failure of leadership ignore the extent to which contextual factors in the Senate were stacked against reform.

In an ACO, physicians and other health care professionals have financial incentives to contain costs and improve quality by coordinating care for a specific group of patients. Hospitals, physicians, and other health care professionals in the organization share the savings."

PPACA does not, however, delineate a standardized approach to improve the delivery process or a specific means to quantify performance for value-based reimbursement; these details are left to administrative agencies to develop and implement. The authors propose that coordinated care can be implemented more effectively and performance quantified more accurately by using personalized health planning, which employs individualized strategic health planning and care relevant to the patient's specific needs. Personalized health plans, developed by providers in collaboration with their patients, quantify patient's health and health risks over time, identify strategies to mitigate risks and/or treat disease, deliver personalized care, engage patients in their care, and measure outcomes. Personalized health planning is a core clinical process that can standardize coordinated care approaches while providing the data needed for performance-based reimbursement. The authors argue that academic health centers have a significant opportunity to lead true health care reform by adopting personalized health planning to coordinate care delivery while conducting the research and education necessary to enable its broad clinical application.

It serves as a built-in warning system that alerts us to injury or disease so it is essential for our health and survival. But if pain persists beyond the usual period of healing, it serves no useful purpose, causes untold physical and emotional suffering, and costs the healthcare system and the economy billions of dollars each year. In 2003, the American Productivity Audit reported that lost productive time from common pain conditions such as headache, back pain, arthritis, and other musculoskeletal problems alone cost $61.2 billion dollars. Ironically, federal dollars dedicated to pain research do not measure up. In 2003, less than 1% ($26 million) of all funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) was allocated to research having a primary emphasis on pain. Although funding increased in 2004, it declined over the next three years. The nation's investment in pain research is “seriously out of scale with the impact of pain on the nation's healthcare burden”. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (often referred to as the healthcare reform bill), which signed into law in March 2010, includes several provisions that should begin to correct this imbalance. © Cambridge University Press 2011."
